# A lifehack.stackexchange.com-based-chatbot

Hey there,

This was an exciting idea to work on. I began by using text data specifically from the lifehacks section of the data dump because the nature of the text was clean, with direction in the sentences which conveniently was on interesting topic. This was my first play with neural networks and I feel like I generated some satisfying results. I go into more detail on my [blog](https://www.kennethchowsk.com/blog/2017/6/6/a-stackexchange-based-lifehack-bot).
