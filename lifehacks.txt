How can I safely trim my fingernails without a fingernail clipper?
As you pointed out, a knife is not a good idea. You can use a standard pair of scissors safely though.If you don't have that, then (as much as I hate to say such a thing) bite them.
How can I clean my sticky keyboard?
I have found that a baby wipe seems to do a good job at cleaning up keyboards. Generally I do this with the power off so as to avoid crazy keystrokes sent to the computer and/or damage to circuitry that may be exposed to the moisture.
How can I keep 2 blankets together on a bed?
I have found that if you have two types of blankets, placing the heavier on on top seems to help with the shifting. 
How can I clean my sticky keyboard?
Personally, I have always used rubbing alcohol 91% to clean my keyboards and other peripherals. Some cotton wool balls, some cotton swabs (the kind you use to clean your ears with, but know you shouldn't) and some gentle rubbing will pretty much remove anything off of your keyboard (nothing escapes the wrath of rubbing alcohol).Use the cotton wool balls to rub your keys in a circular motion to remove remnants of potato chips and whatever else is causing gunk build up on your keyboard. Only use small amounts of rubbing alcohol at a time, you don't want to soak the wool in it or it will drip inside of your keyboard and could cause havoc.Using the cotton wool tips/swabs, you can get in between the keys and other hard to reach places. A soft rubbing up and down motion with a slightly damp swab/tip will remove basically everything from your keyboard that didn't come with it from the factory.If your keyboard is seriously gunked up and gross, you are going to have to remove the keys themselves by prying them off and soaking them in rubbing alcohol. I have only had to do this twice or so in the last few years.An alternative solution if rubbing alcohol is not your thing:I have a friend who swears by those magic erasers, having used them myself around the house, they actually work really well. Simply get yourself some Mr. Clean (or whatever they're called locally) magic erasers which are simply just Melamine foam, slightly dampen them, squeeze out any extra water and slightly rub your keys and anywhere else to remove the gunk.Be mindful not to push too hard as Melamine foam (magic erasers) tend to shed when you use too much force, a little pressure goes a long way with this magic foam. While it does work, I prefer the rubbing alcohol approach because you can use cotton swabs/tips to get in between the keys which you would struggle to do so with a magic eraser. 
How can I safely trim my fingernails without a fingernail clipper?
It's a good idea to carry a small swiss army knife scissor, which you can use in such situations to clip your nails. Also, if possible, soften your nails by soaking them for a few minutes in water prior to clipping them.
Permanent marker on a dry erase board?
I have found that using a dry erase marker on the dried permanent marker will actually "blend" the two pigments together and re-activate the permanent marker into a liquid state for a milisecond. Then the two marker types dry once again, this time with the active ingredient within the dry erase marker allowing it to be wiped off from the surface easily.The longer the permanent marker remains on the board, the higher the likelihood of a stain appearing, however, a second pass with the dry erase marker over the board seems to remove nearly all of the mistake.
How can I keep 2 blankets together on a bed?
Is there any trick to keeping the 2 blankets together despite my tossing and turning?I've had the same problem.One way to do this is to find longer blankets and tuck them into your bed or under your mattress. If you can tuck them both into the foot and side of your bed, it will work pretty well. This might be less feasible if you are not alone in bed.Some blanket types naturally stick together, too. Fleece for example will stick together better than a blanket without much friction. Try to layer them in such a way that the "high friction" sides stick together, too, if the top/bottom of the blankets are different.You can also get larger blankets than your bed. If you have a queen, get a king sized blanket(s). This also helps you be able to tuck them in but will also weigh down the blanket on the sides somewhat.
Permanent marker on a dry erase board?
I usually use rubbing alcohol to get the permanent marker off. For some reason this happens to me a lot.
How can I keep 2 blankets together on a bed?
To take a different direction than what's already been suggested. I would look less into the blankets moving and more into you moving.The less you move in your sleep, the less likely you are to displace the blankets. If you do displace the blankets then, it's going to be because you were getting too warm and threw them off; there's nothing to fix that except fixing the temperatures in the room.Start training your body to move as little as possible. The easiest way to do this is by sleeping on a couch for a while. Unless you have a behemoth couch, there's not going to be enough room for you to toss about like if you were on a bed.Another way to train your body to lie still, is to place two objects on either side of you in the bed. Two pillows usually work. When you start to roll in your sleep, you'll subconsciously recognize that there are the objects in your way, and keep from moving about so much.Be warned though, that once you've done this, you can get stuck with it being difficult to sleep when you're not in a specific position that you've trained yourself to sleep.
What is the best way to open clamshell packaging?
Wikipedia has a nice solution:Household scissors or a utility knife are sometimes used to open difficult packaging.Tin snips are effective for tough plastics; the higher mechanical advantage of compound metal snips make it possible to cut such packages open even using little hand strength. These packages can also be opened with an ordinary household can opener.
What is the best way to open clamshell packaging?
I have found it easiest to run a razor knife / utility knive along two adjacent sides, avoiding the sealed edge. The plastic is very hard and durable where the seal is, but it is relatively thin if you move in a bit from the seal. Cutting along two adjacent sides in an "L" formation allows for easier access to the product, and helps to avoid getting cut by the plastic's edge. 
How can I safely grate a small food item without cutting my fingers?
I have used the palm of my hand to "finish off" a block of cheese.If you apply the pressure with the center of your hand and raise your fingers up a bit, away from the grater, you will be able to safely push the cheese through the holes and crumble off the remaining bit without the risk of loosing your finger tips.
How can I cut my own hair to different lengths?
The flowbee is a nice product for this situation.However, not all "made for tv" items work as expected. I have found that using my fingers + the guard that comes with the clippers gives a nice inch and a half length to the top of my head.There are numerous guard lengths available for many hair clipper brands, usually numbered 1-4 (4 being the longest). Try a "number 4" guard and use a "scissors" pinching motion on your hair, running the clippers with the guard attached across your fingers. The combination of the guard and the fingers may be enough to give you the length you want.you can also try to mimic the hair salon method of using a comb, but this may take a steady hand to hold the hair up away from your scalp, and then trim along the comb. I like the finger method myself because I can safely rest my hand on my head and know it isn't moving around.
What is the best way to cool off with an oscillating fan without having it blowing directly on me?
From my (unscientific) experimentation, these two tips made the fan most effective:Place the fan on top of a desk.Make sure one stop point of the motion is aimed at the open corner of your cubicle. Have the other stop point toward the center of the space.Each of these will help increase the circulation of air.

Permanent marker on a dry erase board?
A solution of chlorine bleach and water will both remove the permanent marker and brighten the white board. You need to allow the white board to dry completely before using it again.Occasionally, the material used by the white board can be degraded by using a bleach solution. Test in a small area to prevent damage to the whole board.
How can I clean my sticky keyboard?
A method that has been safe for all standard and mechanical keyboards I have owned is to actually run it through the dishwasher - no joke. You can find some articles online with suggestions about the best way to do it but I do not know anyone who has nor have I ever had any of my keyboards end up being damaged by the process. 
How to dust Venetian blinds?
I've found a vacuum to be the best tool for this job, as long as you have a brush attachment. You still must run the brush along each slat but it's much faster than a cloth. There are even special attachments that go on a vacuum nozzle which clean several slats at once.
What is the quickest way to cool down a room-temperature drink without pouring it over ice?
If you need to rapidly cool beverages that are still sealed in cans or bottles, put them in a mixture of water, ice, and salt. Once the beverages are submerged in the mixture you can stir them to have them cool even faster. The salt melts the ice faster cooling the water more quickly. This only takes a few minutes to cool you beverage.I've heard this from multiple sources and done it myself. I think there was even a Mythbusters episode where they tried this as well as some other very impractical methods. (Link and comment provided by @Mast - Mythbusters Season 3 Episode 6 "Cooling a Six Pack" - Do note the link is technically not part of any answer whatsoever. The methods used in the video are highly impractical and should under no circumstance be tried at home.)
What is the quickest way to cool down a room-temperature drink without pouring it over ice?
The keyword is dissipation.What you want is a large amount of liquid on the right temperature. The larger the amount, the better (a large amount of liquid heats up less quickly because there's more to heat up. If it heats up too much, it isn't cooling much.). The relative heat of the cans will be dissipated by the liquid. It's important the cans are completely submerged.Water from the tap is a quick fix, but if you have anything colder around that works as well. Filling the liquid with ice will keep the temperature of the water lower and is usually a good idea as well, if any is available.If you happen to have a large (preferably filled) container in the freezer, you can throw this in the water as well. It will have the same effect as adding ice (the larger the container, the better). Keep in mind the container probably was there for a reason. However, one need can overrule another.
What can I do to stop my eyes from drying out when I'm driving?
Stay hydrated before you go -- this can only help. (But not so hydrated that you have to stop to do your... er, business.)Stop at a rest area and sit with your eyes closed for a while.(I've done this, but it may not be a good idea) Close one eye at a time for short periods (<3 sec.) when you are the only car around. (i.e., you're not merging on the highway or in heavy traffic.)Wear glasses (if you don't already).Use eyedrops that are made to keep your eyes hydrated.
How can I safely trim my fingernails without a fingernail clipper?
While working in construction I would tear/split my nails fairly often, I found using simple wire cutters and tidying up any ragged edges with a fine grit sand paper worked pretty well.
How can I clean my sticky keyboard?
If you recently spilled something sticky inside your (laptop) keyboard, the surface will not only be problematic. Under the keys, all sorts of goop will accumulate. This tutorial is also good for regular cleaning, but is better suited for emergencies.First off, unless you really know where each little key on your keyboard goes, take a picture.Now, start peeling off all keys. Usually you can do this with your finger, but sometimes a spudger or a screwdriver might be needed. If you see any keys with metal bars (most "large" keys have them), remove the metal bars.Now that you've got all of your keys off, you need to prepare the "solution" for them. Using two bowls, fill one with some isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. Fill the second with some warm water and a little bit of dish soap.Dump all the keys into the bowl with the dish soap. Let them sit for maybe 10 minutes.Carefully pour out the water and then rinse the keys.Once the keys are all rinsed, place them in the rubbing alcohol.Wait about 5 minutes, then rinse the keys again.Let the keys air dry.If you're impatient, you can dry the keys using a hair dryer. Make sure the hair dryer is on the lowest possible setting, and the keys are only exposed to heat as little time as possible. (It's a good idea to pre-dry the keys a little bit before this).If you want, clean under your keyboard. Using Q-Tips and rubbing alcohol, swab the places where the keys were. Baby wipes are also good at cleaning gunk out.Reassemble your keyboard. Place any metal bars back in their proper place.Test your keyboard.This guide was sourced from many places online, in addition to my own experience with a laptop covered in soda.
What can I do to stop my eyes from drying out when I'm driving?
Get yourself a set of sunglasses of which the actual lenses can be replaced. Popular low-cost sets have 3 different colors: black, orange and transparent. The black blocks 90% of the light, the orange about 40-50% and the transparent 10%. That 10% is negligible for sight, but it does keep the dry air away.I usually wear them while biking, which seems like a comparable situation.

How to clean out a peanut butter jar for recycling?
I have found that using hot, hot water from the faucet helps to soften the peanut butter and loosen it from the jar's edges and surface. Often times I will fill it with hot water and let it soak for 10-15 minutes or so, and then return to the jar and empty it. Then, using hot water I use the sprayer nozzle from my sink to maneuver within the jar and remove all of the leftovers.

Keeping raccoons out of a dumpster
If you can't modify the dumpster, perhaps you can modify the area around it? With some ingenuity and planning you could build a frame that is easily removable for day use, and pickup, but at night becomes a locking mechanism around the receptacle.By using a 4x4 post, which is quite heavy, and laying it across the top of the covers, it would eliminate the critters ease of lifting the arm and getting into the dumpster. if you can manage to "lock" it into place with side walls, then you eliminate their ability to move it. If it doesn't move, and isn't easily lifted, they may give up and move on to the neighbors waste area.

What is the best way to get rid of steam on a mirror?
What you are looking for would be an anti-fog window cleaner. The chemical agents within the cleaner prevent condensation which in turn creates "fog" on a window or glass surface.This is a nice wiki-how dedicated to making your own should you not want to purchase any.
What is the best way to get rid of steam on a mirror?
Keep it clean. Use a glass cleaner such as Windex regularly.Use a blow dryer to blow warm, dry air on the window.
What is the best way to get rid of steam on a mirror?
The fog is because the mirror surface temperature is below the dew point of the air in the room. That leads to two obvious approaches:Increase the mirror surface temperature, that is, get a heated mirror.Decrease the dew point (humidity) of the air in the room. For example, if its a bathroom mirror, turn on the bathroom exhaust fan during your shower. This will also help prevent mold growth in the bathroom.And, the quick fix... wipe it off with a clean towel, or remove it with a blow dryer. This works once you've got the humidity down a little.

Keeping raccoons out of a dumpster
Here's what I ended up building to keep the raccoons out:Basically I took a 2"x2"x4' length of wood and attached two boards about 8"x4' to  the top and bottom, making a sort of "I-beam" and then fixed a 2"x4"x6' to the top board.To put it on the dumpster you just position the I-beam between the two lids and slide the bottom board of the I-beam under the lids, so that you end up with the 2x2 between the lids and a board above the lids and a board below the lids. Then you just slide it all the way back till the cross beam is over the two lids.This eliminates the gap between the two lids and still allows the lids to be opened, but as one one large lid rather than two small ones. With the two lids now moving as one piece the raccoons can't open it because they can't lift the lid while standing on top of it and they can't reach the lid from the ground.It's working well so far, although the raccoons haven't given up yet... I'll snap some photo's of the finished piece and add them here when I get a chance.

What is the quickest way to defog car windows?
The fog comes from water condensing on the windshield or windows. The problem is that the air inside the car is warmer and/or wetter than outside. (e.g., https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=1511)One of the faster ways is to lower your windows to lower the temperature in the car, and decrease the humidity by bringing in outside air. This may not be particularly comfortable but it definitely works.
What is the best way to get rid of steam on a mirror?
Put heating cable behind the mirror. It will keep the mirror at a higher temperature than the air, so no condensation can occur. Works like a charm!Described here.

How do I prop up a laptop screen with a broken hinge?
Use some duct tape and some rubber bands. If you use just the right size, it will apply just enough friction to prop the screen up. If it will simply fall, glue or tape a small metal bar to the back, so it will stop falling if it reaches the case (the part with the CPU, etc).

Removing blood from colored clothes
Soak them in cold water immediately to prevent the blood from setting. Then scrub with washing soda (wear gloves) to loosen any that remains from the cloth. After rinsing thoroughly, you can machine-wash on a cold cycle with additional washing soda and/or boosters as normally needed by your local water. Inspect carefully before drying: if stains remain, repeat the soak+scrub to remove them. Once dried, you will find it exceedingly difficult to remove blood stains without also harming the color of your clothing.
How do I remove dust from fabric lampshades?
You can get a length of clear packing tape about 8-10" long and, holding the ends, press it against the lampshade and draw it back off. It will have picked up the dust in that area. Then press it on another spot. Repeat this process until the lampshade is clean. Unless it's very dusty, the tape usually lasts a good 2-3 shades for me. Once it is no longer sticky enough for use I cut another piece.
How to clean blood from white clothes
My father always told me to use hydrogen peroxide to clean bloodstains from clothing.I've done that many times; it works :)Howstuffworks.com also recommends using it -- they also explain how it works:The hydrogen peroxide found in many medicine cabinets for the  treatment of wounds behaves comparably to the bleach we add to washes.  When applied to blood stains, for example, peroxide liberates oxygen  atoms, which turns red blood pigments into less brightly colored  stains.
What is the best way of cleaning the glass on a wood burning stove?

How to keep the windshield from freezing over?
Cover your windshield with aluminium:Applied on a windshield, your car will look like this:It will prevent any dew freezing on in most scenarios (it won't work against heavy snowfall and blizzards, naturally).However, even if a lot of snows falls on top of it, removing the cover will still take care of most of the freezing.
How to keep the windshield from freezing over?
If you leave your car uncovered outside in freezing rain, it will ice up just like everything else. Sorry, but the only solution there is to cover it.For snow however, you can greatly reduce and in some cases eliminate ice build-up by just making sure your windshield is cold before allowing any snow to fall on it. Ideally, this means parking your car and letting it cool for a few hours before the snow starts falling, but if it's cold enough outside you can speed this up by turning off the heat and opening your windows for the last part of the drive home. You'll still end up with some heating from the engine, unfortunately. Also, make sure you have a good hat with you.
Quick way to defrost food?

If I break a window, how can I keep out cold air while I buy another?
Use multiple layers of thick plastc foil in combination with some strong tape.Multiple layers since it provides better insulation that way, and strong tape for the wind.Make sure you completely seal the window by some margin with the foil and just tape them over your window one after the other.You can relatively easily remove them again when you bought your new glass, too
If I break a window, how can I keep out cold air while I buy another?
Duct-tapeMy personal favourite for a lot of 'let's fix this quick-and-dirty' situations.No cutting involved, again available at most hardware stores.It's quite strong and will hold a lot of wind. Applying multiple layers is usually a good idea to keep it airtight.
If I break a window, how can I keep out cold air while I buy another?
2 mil or thicker plastic works great. Just stick it up with duct tape and forget about it. If the wind is strong, you can use furring strips and staples to tack down the edges. If the wind isn't too strong, you can use a window insulator kit to accomplish the same - some even offer pre-cut, pre-tapped panels that can just be rolled out. Try to get the 3M tape; it's a lot stronger than most of the competitors.

How can I stop my shower from dripping
My wife came up with a brilliant solution that worked instantly:Using a piece of waterproof tape, she stuck a length of cotton to the shower head that reaches down to floor level.Instead of drips, the water droplets run silently down the thread.Apparently she got the idea from a James Bond film...
What can I do to find the end of the tape roll easily?
Take a razor blade or utility knife and slice through the first layer of tape. Then peel it off from wherever you sliced it; you can use the blade to lift the tape as well. One way or the other, you'll find the end.
How can I stop my shower from dripping
Install a shower shut-off valve behind the head, and shut it off when you're not using it. The one I linked to is brass, but if you're not picky you can probably find a plastic one for half the price at your local hardware store. This'll take you all of 5 minutes to install - you should be able to just unscrew your shower head and screw this on. As a bonus, this'll let you reduce your water usage by turning off the shower while lathering, letting you restore the flow without inadvertently adjusting the water temperature. If you shave in the shower, you can save even more water. If you don't actually like showering, you can just leave it off and pretend to lather - this saves the most water. 
How can I (painlessly) add/remove keys to my key ring?
I usually use a staple remover to open a crack in the ring and then add or remove the key painlessly. The smaller the staple remover, the better, because a bigger one might not fit or damage the ring.

First, make sure the jar (and lid) are clean. A dusty jar can make it hard to maintain a firm grip. Then make sure your hands are clean, for the same reason.If your hands are too dry, you may also struggle to maintain a firm grip. That said, you don't want them to be wet (or covered in grease / lotion / corn husker's friend) either - if rubbing your hands together feels rough, cup them and breathe into them - the moisture in your breath should suffice to let your skin grip the (clean) surface.Make sure you're not using your wrists to break the seal. That's a good way to hurt your wrists, but a bad way to put any real force on the lid. Keep your wrists straight and use your arms to apply force to the jar and lid.Finally, if you find that your hands are too weak to grip the lid firmly, invest in a couple of cheap hand grips.
Tricks for opening very tight jars
Turn the jar upside down over the counter. Then rap the entire surface of the jar lid sharply on the counter. This breaks the seal on the jar.  Now just open it as you normally do.

How can I (painlessly) add/remove keys to my key ring?
I end up using the key I want to put on the keyring.I slide the cuts of the key into the groove, opening it. Then, I keep pushing until the entire blade is in the keyring. I then rotate the key until the hole is relatively near the start of the keychain. I slide it on, and done.
Tricks for opening very tight jars
Usually jars with stiff lids are fresh from the store and have been packed with the contents under lower pressure than the outside air i.e a vacuum.  This pressure difference can increase the resistance presented by the thread and can make opening a jar for the first time difficult.This approach that can be taken if a little damage to the lid is acceptable and requires only tools that are readily available in most kitchens.Take a small tool like a butter knife or spoon.Tilt the jar so that the seam between the jar and the lid is accessible.Insert the tip of the tool into the seam.Gently leaver the tool until it lifts the lid back from the jar, breaking the seal and allowing the pressure to equalize.Now that the seal has been released it should be easy to twist the lid off normally.With a little practice and a light touch it is possible to release the seal without permanently changing the shape of the lid.  I am happy enough keeping any food remaining in these jars if refrigerated but would avoid reusing the jar for projects with sterile requirements like making jam or preserves.
Cleaning a dirty computer screen
Baby wipes are one good option.I usually use a paper towel or soft cloth (microfiber is good) sprayed lightly with Windex or another glass cleaner. (If it's a touchscreen, be sure to dry it with another paper towel or the other side of the cloth)
Cleaning a dirty computer screen
It depends on the type of monitor.If it has a matte layer (antiglare), get a microfiber cloth. Moisten the cloth and wipe down the screen. Dry it with another (dry) cloth.If it's a touch screen, just wipe it down. Liquids can cause "false touches" and cause issues. If it's really bad, use a tiny bit of water on a microfiber cloth, or turn the device off (really off, not locked) before following the directions below for clear glass.If it's just regular clear glass, use baby wipes or Windex with a microfiber cloth.Never ever EVER use paper products! Due to their extremely rough surface, they cause scratches in the screen. They might not be too obvious, but they build up fast.

Fastest way to boil water?
Make sure you put a cover on the can. Not a tight cover; just something to keep the top of the water from losing heat (see this question).If that's still not fast enough for you, you have a few options:Leave a full kettle over a low flame all day long, turn it up when you need hot water. You just pay for the cost of the energy required to keep it hot, but can be dangerous if you let it boil dry.Invest in an electric kettle. They're cheap, and will boil water faster than most stovetops. Invest in an instant hot water system. Near-boiling water on tap whenever you want it. Safer than option #1, not cheap though.
Tricks for opening very tight jars
Put a spoon under the lip of the lid, and lever it up a bit (you're not popping off the lid, just depressurizing the vacuum). You'll be able to unscrew the lid now.My grandmother originally taught me this trick but I found a step by step guide (along with a photo) on Lifehacker:Hold the spoon in one hand and the jar firmly in the other.Nestle the spoon in the crack between the lid and the glass. Push upand back. You want to break the seal.Press up with the spoon to loosen the lid. If the seal does notbreak, rotate the jar and repeat, pressing up and back with thespoon until you hear a pop.Let go of the spoon and twist the lid off. It will come of smoothlyand easily.http://lifehacker.com/400144/open-a-stuck-jar-with-a-spoon

How do I stop my earphones from getting tangled
Wrap them in a figure-8 pattern like this: http://lifehacker.com/152499/keep-headphone-wires-from-getting-tangledHere is a description of the process:With your right hand make devil horns (third and fourth fingerstucked, second and fifth extended)Use your thumb to hold the earbuds against your palmWrap the cable around your 2nd and 5th fingers using a figure-8.This is really the key part, the cris-crossing prevents it fromknottingWhen you have 6 to 8 inches of cable left, wrap the remaining cablearound the center of the figure-8 a few timesTuck remaining cable to taste. Sometimes I tuck it through one ofthe figure-8 loops, sometimes through the center wrapping, sometimesnot at all.Tightness of the wrapping determines how well it holds together, but if you use a loose wrap, you can just pull on the earbuds and the whole thing comes undone without a single knot.

How do I stop my earphones from getting tangled
I find it quickest while still being effective to do the following:Hold the headphones at the plug sideLine two or three fingers up next to each other (it determines how small of a loop you'll create)Wrap the cord around your fingers until a couple inches are leftLoop the ear buds through the middle of the loop you just created two times so and make sure it's tightThe end goal is to wrap the chord up and then make sure that wrap doesn't come undone, usually using one side of the chord to do so. Using this approach gives you fine control of how big you want to make the loop by changing the number of fingers and space between each.
What is an inexpensive and non-electric way to warm my sheets before getting in them?
Ah, this is an age-old question!In times of yore, folks would use a bed warmer to hold hot coals with which to quickly heat their beds. Hot coals are generally useful things to have around; you may remember them from such well-received answers as what is the fastest way to toast bread and the upcoming "How do I quickly obtain a delicious steak at 3AM?" Note that those less privileged would rely on items which could be warmed by a fire and hold a good deal of heat, releasing it over time to warm a cold bed; Laura Ingalls Wilder describes in her famed books the use of common household items such as bricks, flatirons and potatoes for this purpose. The Wikipedia article notes that the common rubber hot water bottle makes an excellent bed-warmer, and I would have to agree - just make sure you get the cap or cork on tightly, as waking up with cold, wet feet is never fun. If waiting for water to heat is ruining your bed-time routine, consider the options presented in Fastest way to boil water.History out of the way, let's consider some other options; as a modern, life-hacky individual, I'm sure you've already discarded such quaint solutions, and rightly so. Here are some alternatives:Adopt a dog. Dogs love laying in your bed to warm it up before you shove them out of the way. And their normal body temperature is higher than yours! If you find cold spots unacceptable, just adopt multiple dogs.Light your bed on fire. Lighter fluid and fire extinguishers are inexpensive these days, and chances are you already have both just lying around doing nothing. Add a thick wool coverlet to protect your delicate sheets, and you've got yourself a recipe for a warm bed in no time! Extra points for playing some Midnight Oil while you brush your teeth.Vigorous, missionary-position sex. This is an old remedy as well, but you may be unaware that while he was sending you to bed with a brick, your grandfather was warming his bed up using nothing but lots of friction and Grandma. A vintage Pentium. Yeah, we're back to "put hot objects at your feet", but this one at least breaks us out of the 1890s and into the 1990s! Classic Pentium chips ran hot enough to require PCs to be redesigned for improved cooling; just the thing to keep your toes toasty!

What is the best method of cleaning up broken glass?
First, put shoes on. And turn on all the lights. You'll want lots of light. Pick up anything that might get in your way and move it to some other location: chairs, books, dogs, etc.Then, pick up the large pieces. By "large" I mean "big enough that you can grasp them without touching the broken edges". Then sweep. Use a good broom, one with feathered bristles, and work slowly. Coax the small pieces out of cracks and out from under any furniture you couldn't move. Then vacuum. Don't use a sweeper; use a machine with an extensible hose that can be guided through any areas missed by the broom. Remember, pieces of shattered glass can fly a long ways; be sure to expand the area you're working in to include all those that might have been hit.If all else fails... I've had a piece of glass embedded in my foot for several years now; you get used to it. 
What is the best method of cleaning up broken glass?
If the vacuum is not sufficient, as expressed in your question, I'm assuming that this is only the really small bits of glass that you can't pick up?

How can I cut onions without tearing up?
The problem with cutting onions is that a gas, partially made up of certain enzymes, is emitted by the cut onion.See, for instance, this article by FoodRepublic:The compound to blame? syn-propanethial S-oxide. Sulfides are  converted to syn-propanethial S-oxide enzymes called allinases, which  are released when the cells of the onion are damaged by the blade of  your knife. This potent lachrymatory agent is then released as a gas  and causes the stinging sensation many of you know all too well.In my experience, wearing glasses (or goggles, I'd assume) helps to mitigate this problem, as they block that gas that comes out of the cut onion.

The trick to picking up glass is water.Follow the common sense approach of lots of light, shoes, do not wear your shoes outside of the affected area to avoid tracking glass around etc, but the trick is:Towel or paper towels doused in water to get everything littler than easy pieces to grab with your fingers. The little slivers will stick to wet paper towels or normal towels if necessary (don't suggest a cloth towel as you'll want to dispose of it afterwards). Also I encourage all broken glass be placed in any cardboard boxes you have laying around for disposal as this is much better way of ensuring you don't cut yourself vs. bags (take the cereal out of it's box and use that, any shoe boxes laying around, any box is better than a bag for containing broken glass)

How to remove a hard boiled egg's shell quickly, by hand, without damaging the egg?
Well, my foolproof method is somewhat a party-trick of sorts. It involves propelling the egg out of its shell...First, you crack the egg at the top and the bottom, and on both sides you gently peel a circle of shell off the egg with a diameter of about 1cm. On the bottom this is easy, on the top... be gentle...After this is done, put the egg in your closed hand with the exposed top to your mouth and blow hard (make sure you keep hold of the egg).The video below explains it in visuals, though the bottom hole is a lot bigger:How to Blow a Boiled Egg out of It's Shell

The drawing of the lines makes sure the small cloggs are transferred to your sole instead of your tongue.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
As it does not reduce tears to 100% rinsing the onions in water before cutting them, and cutting on a wet board helps to reduce the effect of aliinase in converting alliin to allicin.

How can I more quickly warm up the interior of my car during winter?
Your heater will reach useful temperature faster if your engine heats up faster, as it takes its heat directly from the engine (usually by water heated by the engine block) - and the engine block heats up faster under load, so:turn on front and rear windscreen heatersturn on lightsrev the engine one it has reached operating temperature (ideally accelerate hard using wide open throttle)use your air coneven turn your stereo up (although this probably only has an effect if you have a powerful amp)While the engine is warming up, select recirculate if your airflow has that option. This means you are just heating the air in the car, not having to heat cold air coming in.Keep the air con fans on low until you start to feel warm air, then select incoming air.

I'm in the rain without an umbrella, how can I get home quickly without getting too wet?
Order a taxi to take you straight to your home. For this case, I keep telephone numbers of trusted taxis in my pocket. While waiting, eat a sandwich in the nearest cafe :)Another variant:I always wear a rain jacket with a hood outside (if I feel that there will be or is a rainy weather), like thissourceIf you have such a jacket, then pull its hood on your head and zip your zipper.If you know a good way to your home with many bus stops, use it.If there is no such a way or you don't know it, try to get to the nearest underground stationNo underground or underground stations nearby, then use a way through alley with trees or run through some forest or copse.If possible don't run against the rain so as not allow the rain to pour your eyes, choose the ways to run along with itAnd, by the way, if you are planning to use newspaper (non-glossy one), I wouldn't recommend to do it in the heavy rain due to the terrible personal experience. I am not saying this about magazines - they are quite good "tool" to "harbor" from rain.

How do I quickly open or close a jammed zipper?
I find this a common problem on metal teethed zips, not so much on plastic ones. Pulling the two sides of the zipper tight at the open end and keeping as much as the zipper as you can in a straight line usually solves any sticking issues, you might need to wobble the zip a little from side to size to release it, but don't directly pull it hard as you risk damaging the teeth can causing more problems.For the really difficult ones, I find a graphite, a crayon the same colour as the material or a candle a good lubricant to loosen them up.
I'm in the rain without an umbrella, how can I get home quickly without getting too wet?
Run, but be careful not to go too quickly, so that you don't slip. Try and stay under cover as much as possible (trees, awnings, someone else's umbrella).Try and judge which way the wind is blowing. Then, even if you're not perfectly under cover, staying behind buildings might block some rain.
How do I pour from a mug without having it drip so much?
The faster the liquid is moving, the less likely it is to drip. If you're pouring, say, from a mug into a pot, just dump it out, and hope it doesn't all splash out. If you can't reasonably dump it out, tilt the cup as much as you can, so that the liquid will move faster.
How do I pour from a mug without having it drip so much?
Always pour from a height.Hold the container which contains the liquid approximately 10 cms high above the empty container into which you are pouring it.Tilt it quicklyTilt the container containing the liquid quickly when you start pouring it. This will prevent the liquid from dripping along it's sides.Use a spoon as a guide, if requiredHold a long handled spoon vertically in the centre of the empty container into which you want to pour the liquid with one hand. Using the other hand, gently start pouring the liquid along the handle of the spoon, so that the liquid will slide down the handle and fill the empty container.

How to remove ice from windshield
If you have a heated windscreen, stick that on first, it'll loosen the ice from surface it's stuck to and it'll just slide off with a little push. If you don't have  heated windscreen, still stick your heaters on full and point them at the windscreen. Any heat is going to help.With a scraper, work from one side and make sure you're scraping underneath the ice, removing the problem from the source, not just taking layers off.De-icer spray works from the top, so I don't think it's that brilliant. But if you have any, it's not gonna do much harm. It may be useful if the ice is being pretty resilient.Finally, don't forget to de-ice your lights! Turning your lights on while your doing your windscreen will probably warm up the ice enough that it will have fallen off by the time you finish.

I'm in the rain without an umbrella, how can I get home quickly without getting too wet?
Run as fast as you can to the nearest shelter without risking slipping.From this BBC article, the equation of wetness (roughly) is:W = p*[a * V_r / V_p + A]*DWhere W is wetness, p is the rain density, a is your "top-side" surface area, A is your "front-side" surface area, V_r is rain velocity and V_p is your own velocity. D is distance to the nearest shelter.The result is that by maximizing V_p the total wetness reduces.Of course if there's no shelter, the equation suggests not moving at all and waiting out the rain:W = p * (a * V_r + A * V_p) * twhere t is the time spent in the rain.

Why does it happen?Preventing onions from making you cry requires understanding why they do so.Onions contain amino acid sulfoxides that form sulfenic acids in the onion cells. Both the enzymes and the sulfenic acids are kept separately in the cells. When you cut the onion, the otherwise separate enzymes start mixing and produce propanethiol S-oxide, which is a volatile sulphur compound that starts wafting towards your eyes. The gas that is emitted reacts with the water of your eyes and forms sulphuric acid. The sulphuric acid thus produced causes burning sensation in your eyes and this in turn leads to the tear glands secreting tears. Thus you end up with watery eyes every time you cut onions at home.Source: Why do onions make us cry?Stopping itOption 1: reduce the gas being emittedStopping (or reducing) the gas being emitted means less of it will get to your eyes. You can stop the gas being emitted by:Refrigerate the onion. When the onion is cold, the enzymes get released much more slowly, and therefore much less gas is released.Make the knife, chopping board and onion wet. This means that the gas reacts with the water already on the onion or equipment, and does not escape to react with the water in your eyes.Option 2: stop the gas reaching your eyeAnother option is to stop the gas from getting as far as your eyes. For example:Wear safety goggles. This creates an actual barrier around your eyes, preventing the gas from reaching them.Keep windows closed and fans off, to reduce air circulation and stop the gas from reaching your eyes.Alternatively, if you have a ventilation fan that can draw the gases away without drawing them to your face, switch it on. Whether this helps or hinders will depend on the exact arrangement of the onion, the fan and your face!Option 3: Get the gas to go elsewhereFinally, you can draw the gas away from your eyes by giving it better things to react with:Stick your tongue out or chew gum with your mouth open. The onion gas will mix with the saliva on your tongue instead of the water in your eyes (because your mouth is closer to the onion than your eyes are).Light a candle near the chopping board. The gas is drawn to the flame and does not reach your eyes.Other tipsMake sure your knife is sharp. You'll cut the onion more "cleanly" (reducing less fumes) and you'll also get the job done faster.Don't rub your eyes. The onion juices on your fingers will make the problem worse.Breathe through your mouth. As well as giving the gas a chance to mix with your saliva (like the "stick your tongue out" method), breathing through your mouth can also reduce teary eyes since the olfactory nerves in your nose are located very close to the tear ducts so can contribute to teary eyes if you breathe through your nose.
How can I get damp clothes to hang-dry faster in the home?
I find that drying is more about the amount of air being moved around more than the temperature, sure a hot tumble dryer or hot radiators do the job the best but it doesn't mean its the only way.So while it isn't perfect (as in near zero cost) a fan in front of your clothes will assist with the drying process, Another option is to keep your clothes hanging high in the house where it'll be a little warmer than ground level, before the creation of tumble driers a lot of houses had rails on a pully system that was used to dry clothes on.
What should I do without hot water in the shower?
Warm some water on the stove to wet down your hair and maybe take a sponge bath. Use deodorant, wear clean clothes.
My pants are falling off!
If the hole in the pants is large enough (if not read below) so you can fiddle a pen through it you take a regular ballpen, hook the cord into the hook at the end.Then use the pen as improvised needle and tug it through the path where the cord should go and have it back in your pants.I recommend taking the ink part out of the pen before applying so you don't accidentally draw on your pants or something.If the hole is not large enough disassemble the pen and use only the hook. As you can see on the image it has a small hook on the right side by itself that can be used in a similar fashion.
Eeek! - Resin in my hair
I had the same problem with it sticking in clothing which I couldn't really put in the washer.My mothers neat trick: Put peanut-butter on it... Leave it for some time and wash it with hot water.I hope this applies to hair as well...
I'm in the rain without an umbrella, how can I get home quickly without getting too wet?
When you are in regions with regular rain, seek a place where you can stay for 5 minutes. After that the rain will stop wetting you instantly and you could use anything that covers your head (newspaper, jacket) to help against the wetting.When you are in regions where sudden bursts of monsoon hit you, do observe the locals. If the street suddenly empties seek shelter quickly. A heavy downpour of rain will rain through most umbrellas anyway but lasts only 30 minutes or so. Wait it out.If you have capacity to prepare for this situation pack a fold able raincoat into your backpack / jacket (whatever you have with you all the time). So then, even if you forgot your umbrella you have something waterproof with you.In doubt: Running faster keeps you drier until the point where you start to slip or are wet through and through anyway.
How can I avoid getting static shocks in the winter?
Even when minding clothing and footwear, an insulated wooden floor can still give me static shocks.For me there are two definitive methods:Make sure the area you touch is as large as possible the moment you touch it (before stepping out of the car, I put my calf to the bottompost of the door. It helps with discharging even through my pants); so don't put your finger on it first...Carry something with you which can help with easy discharging. Come winter, I am always carrying a key in my pocket, with which I touch metal door handles before opening the door. You can even see a spark igniting between the tip of the key and the handle, which makes it extra fun to do as well =)
How can I avoid getting static shocks in the winter?
I've been using a tip I found in a comment on Lifehacker.com.Before touching metal with my fingers, I now tap it with the back of my hand, so that the electricity discharges through the back of my hand. I feel it much less that way, because there are a lot fewer nerve endings.
How can I eat an apple without getting sticky fingers?
I hold the apple with one hand and eat a circle around the "equator".I then either snap the apple in half and eat the remaining flesh from each half, holding the inner bit of the core and a "dimple".Eating the remaining flesh without snapping the apple in half is possible, but I find this leaves me with a sticky chin.
How to remove screws with stripped heads?
You can use a good knife or other very sharp and very hard tool and make small parallel scratches on the screw (whatever is left of it), alternatively one deeper scratch in the middle. Then use the hack of abby and a flat tool. I found it most useful to use the inbus (hexagonal screw) bit of my tools to be perfect for this. Depending on the situation you have at hand a rounded tool may be of more use.You need to apply a lot of downward force on the tool to do this.That way you will press the rubber band into the small scratches and when you turn the tool it will start twitching slightly. This takes some time to produce results but works. You can monitor the progress if you make the scratches parallel to something nearby.This assumes the screw will turn at all, so you might need to lubricate it before doing this. If its rusted in or otherwise totally unturnable, you might have lost.
How can I eat an apple without getting sticky fingers?
Take a knife / fork or something and jam it top down into the apple. Then you have a nice handle and can eat all the apple you want.When finished use something other then your hand to strip the apple off the knife / fork and clean it. I do this by laying the apple on the ground, standing on it and pull the knife out to the side. You have to clean your knife afterwards, so it isn't sticky itself. A leaf from a tree can work as hanky in this case.Be careful not to cut yourself or bite on the metal though.
How do I prevent pencils from breaking?
You can use carpenter pencils. They are more rigid and don't usually break at all. Also, they are sharped using a knife which I found to be more readily available then pencil sharpeners.
Permanent marker on a dry erase board?
The easiest solution I've found is baby wipes. They seem to get everything off. Then go over with a dry paper towel. No muss, no fuss. 
Tricks for opening very tight jars
Put the jar on a piece of wood (or other material that is soft enough for the buttom knobs of the glass to sink it, but not too soft to provide grip). Then lay your hands (both!) on top of it and lean with your wight on the glass, start with a little and intensify carefully. Then twist it with you whole body, keeping your arms rigid. The glass part should stick to the wood as the knobs on the bottom are pressed into the wood, the lid moves with you. Then the glass is open.You have to make sure that the wood can't move away. Your wood will have glass markings on it afterwards.
Remove expansion foam from clothes
The only quick way to get dried expansion foam off your clothes is to use solvents, but they can damage your clothes and make the problem worse by damaging the fibers and discoloring the fabric. You could try freezing it and then chipping/scraping it off. I've had some success with that method in the past depending on the fabric. The best you get with that method is the surface clean but it does leave it still within the fabric. There will likely be some discoloration from the solvents in the foam even if you do get it off, so whether it's worth a lot of effort depends. Prevention in this case is the only cure - I keep a set of old clothes for those rare occasions I work with the stuff. 
How to separate egg yolk from whites
One good hack that I have learnt and used is to use an empty bottle.After breaking the entire egg contents on to a bowl, press the bottle so there is air let out.  Then place the mouth of the bottle on the yellow and release the pressure.  The yellow gets sucked into the bottle leaving the white alone.  
How can I quickly eliminate the smell of cigarette smoke in a confined space?
First thing would be to open all the windows, of course.But just ventilating the room wouldn't help you; it is a known fact that smoke settles on the walls, ceiling, floor; carpets also detain it a lot (what else?) that will prevent disappearing of this annoying smell. So cleaning them should speed up removing the smoke smell.(it is filtered information from moving.about.com)
How to separate egg yolk from whites
The Empty-Water-Bottle MethodSqueeze a washed empty water bottle.   Place the opening of the bottle over an egg yolk, still squeezing,and slowly let go of your squeeze.The yolk should get sucked right up.In case you don't use water bottles or don't have any laying around, there are commercial suction separators like Pluck and Yolkr.The Hand-Strainer Method:Wash your hands. Crack the egg over your palm.Let the egg whites drip through the spaces between your fingers until all that is left is the yolk in your hand.Buy a Commercial Egg-Yolk Separator:If you are making egg whites regularly, it might be worthwhile to buy a separator. They are inexpensive and don't require you to keep empty water bottles around or dirty your hands.
How to remove ice from windshield
The best way to get ice off your windshield is to heat your car up. When I lived in Wisconsin I used to turn on my car with the defroster (AC off) on full blast, go back and have a shower/get dressed, then come back and the ice would just slide off. 
How can I (painlessly) add/remove keys to my key ring?
I have generally used two methods for removing keys from keychains:Staple-Remover MethodSince staple removers have sharp, thin teeth, simply place the sharp points between the keychain rings and slowly press down. This should spread the keychain apart and make it easy to roll the new key on/take the old key off the chain.Coin MethodSince I often don't have a staple remover readily on-hand, I usually use a coin. This video and description are helpful:Get a coin about the size of a quarter.Press the edge of the coin against the key ring at a 45 degree angle, near where it opens; the coin will slide under part of the key  ring, lifting the end up.Apply pressure to the coin so that it lifts up the end of the key ring enough to slide the key on. Then slide the key on.Remove the coin and slide the key on the rest of the way.
How to counteract the burning sensation after eating spicy food?
What has worked for me is drinking some cool milk or eating bread.The water usually doesn't help me; sometimes it even makes it worse.
How to counteract the burning sensation after eating spicy food?
The cause for the pain from spicy food is often something called capsaicin (which is in chili). Other possibilities include piperine (pepper) or Isothiocyanate (wasabi and related)Capsaicin is not soluble in water, and drinking water just spreads it through your mouth further. Instead it's soluble in fat and fat-based lotions.The same applies to the other mentioned chemical compounds. Some are easily soluble in Ethanol (better known as alcohol).What you want to do accordingly is drink milk, eat yogurt or similar fat-based foods to ease the pain. Alternatively you could try an alcoholic beverage, but they are effective against less kinds of "hot"

How do I get lint out of a headphone jack?
Use a 1/16" drill bit. Do not put the bit into a drill! Just grip it between your thumb and forefinger.Press the end lightly into the lint-filled bottom of your headphone jack and spin it clockwise.Pull the bit gently out; there should be some lint on the tip.Repeat steps 1-3 until lint is gone. Clean jack with alcohol and q-tip or whatever you normally use.If you don't have a drill bit, a toothpick will work - but the bit does a better job of gripping packed lint.
How can I prevent windows from steaming up at night?
Condensation is formed when warm air meets the cold glass and the water vapour in the air condenses into water droplets.There are a few ways you can mitigate this:Warm the glass. This is extremely energy-inefficient (with the associated expense and detriment to the environment that that implies), but warming the glass by pointing a fan heater at it or installing a radiator beneath it and turning the heat up high would reduce the effect of cold air hitting the window.Install thicker curtains. This better insulates the warm room-air from reaching the cold glass in the first place (not to mention keeping your room warmer) which will reduce the effect of condensation.Make the room colder. Instead of using radiators and heaters to warm the entire room, use hot water bottles and blankets to warm only the space that you sleep in. There will be less of a temperature difference between inside and outside, resulting in less condensation on the windows.Buy a dehumidifier. By taking the water vapour out of the air, there will be less water to condense on the glass. Following on from this, use extraction fans when boiling water on the stove or running a bath or shower (or keep the kitchen/bathroom doors shut) to prevent humid air from escaping to the rest of the house.A lifehack-y version of the dehumidifier option would be to keep a large jar of silica gel or other dehumidifying chemical (talc?) near to the window. I'm not sure how effective this would be without cycling the air; my suspicion would be that the warm humid air would rise above the silica gel unless you put it really high up. However, I included it so that you can experiment if you so desire.
How do I get lint out of a headphone jack?
A straightened paper clip with a little turn at the end generally does the trick. 
How do I remove gum from my beard?
I can't laugh at you because well... I found the best way out of this is to use a strong citrus solvent (I use this). It worked, but leaves a residue, and can cause minor irritation. Spray it on, work it in as well as you can, and let it sit for a minute or two. The gum should loosen from the hair, and pull out much easier. If it's below freezing outside, and you have a long beard, do it outside, because the cold will make the gum become less sticky, and roll off easier.
Easiest way to remove adhesive from shirts?
I've used a citrus solvent for this, with good results. I used something like this. Spray it on, rub it in, let it sit for a minute, and scrub it with a wet rag. Repeat if necessary.Because this type of solvent has the capability of removing some clothing dyes, test a small amount on an inconspicuous spot before treating. On colored clothes, mixing the solvent in lukewarm water before applying it can help.
How do I fold a fitted sheet?
No, there isn't. Because the it's bigger on the inside. ;) A neat fold of these sheets will mean pushing the higher corner of the fold into the lower one, on both corners, so that although it's not flat, the sheet will be symmetrical, and fairly smooth, once folded.
How can I keep from squirting myself with ketchup whenever I use ketchup packets?
Since you specifically reference your office in your dilemma, keep some scissors at your desk and snip a larger hole in the top of the packet instead of tearing a small holeLarger hole = less pressure = less risk of "extreme velocities"
How do I remove gum from my beard?
According to wikiHow you can use peanut butter:Get one of the "home made" styles. The higher the fat content thebetter, when you first open the jar if you see a little puddle ofpeanut oil on top it should work.Apply the peanut butter to the affected area with your fingers or anold toothbrush, don't be afraid to use too much.Use a toothbrush or comb to work the gum/peanut butter out and away using long strokes. The idea is to dissolve the gum in the oil from the peanut butter.Use a dry towel to pull the peanut butter out. The gum should come out with the peanut butter.Wash, rinse and repeat if necessary. Be sure to check the link, it has a few other methods that may be worth exploring. I only included the peanut butter method because that is the most common one.
What should I do without hot water in the shower?
Use multiple heating pots or similar things to heat as much water as you can as quickly as possible (Using multiple pots each with only some water in it will give you more hotter water quicker than just using one pot that contains much water; Using all your heating stations is best of course).Then pour all that hot water into a large container (e.G. your shower after you have plugged it so the water can't get out).Then fill the container with so much cold water that the water in the container becomes as comfortable as possible.Separate some water into two pots.Use the sponge to clean you with soap and shampoo your hair. Then open the sink so the shower drains and use the two pots (one for the hair, one for the body) to wash off the soap and shampoo.Be certain to dry your hair throughly before leaving the house if its cold outside.
How can I keep pizza warm on the trip home?
You know the insulated bags used to keep groceries cold on the trip home? They look like this or similar:They also work to keep things warm. If you have one big enough for pizza, put it in the bag preferably in the shop, get as much air out as possible, and put it in your car (which should be warmed up first in winter) on one of the seats, then put a towel/folded blanket over it. Eat as soon as possible after arriving at your destination.
How to remove screws with stripped heads?
If the head is not counter sunk, a pair of lock grip pliers (vice grips) can be used to grasp the head of the screw and turn it. 
How can I keep pizza warm on the trip home?
Get an old blanket and lay it over the pizza boxes on the seat, covering the sides of the boxes if possible. If the blanket is large enough, fold it first so that you have 2 or 4 layers keeping your pizza hot.I have found this to be more effective than insulated bags, especially when the blanket is doubled up.*(Old blanket so that if there is sauce/grease on the outside, you're not out your favorite blanket)
How can I keep pizza warm on the trip home?
If your car has a seat warmer (most modern ones do), turn it on and put the pizza (in the box) on the seat. If you really want warm pizza, put a jacket/blanket/something over it.
What should I do without hot water in the shower?
To fix your greasy hair instantly, loosely powder it. This is an instant quick fix.Dig up a big, fluffy makeup brush, and dip it into a pot of loose powder. Tap it once on the back of your hand to remove the excess, then dust it over your roots. It mops up oil and blends into your strands, so no one will know you didn't shower.(Source: Cosmopolitan)Then, squeeze a bit of lemon in some water. Lemon is a natural cleanser and deodorant. You can use this solution to wipe and cleanse your skin.  Now you are ready to leave for work. Please note these are quick hacks, and you should take a proper shower later.
How can I keep from squirting myself with ketchup whenever I use ketchup packets?
Carry something like this with you:(with a rubberband holding it shut, of course). You can get it out quickly and use it anytime, and you'll probably end up using it for other things as well. :)
How do I fill a hot water urn that doesn't fit in the sink?

How do I prevent pencils from breaking?
Mechanical pencils. Even though they may break more it's not an issue. But seriously, from a pure time-efficiency standpoint if you can deal with how the mechanical writes I'd go with that instead of normal pencils.Maybe I'm just bad at using them though. x.x
How do I eat a mango without getting sticky?
I do have a hack, for a ripe mango. I really dont eat it, I prefer to crush it to the point where it is almost semi-liquid and then just bite the bottom edge of it and then suck the entire thing.

How can I amplify the speakers of my iPhone?
I've had success by placing the phone with the speakers facing up in a large, tall ceramic/glass/metal bowl. Plastic or wood doesn't work as well.It's not too much louder, but it does make a difference.
If I break a window, how can I keep out cold air while I buy another?
You can use some empty trash bags and duct-tape to temporarily keep the cold out.
How can I clean sticky juice off my hands when outside?
The best way would be to find some type of water, whether it's a puddle, a stream, bottled water, licking your hands, or something else near you.If that's not an option, you could try crushing up moist leaves or grass. In my experience it provides enough moisture to remove a good bit of the stickiness when combined with rubbing. Of course, then your hands will smell like plants...Another method my friend mentioned to me is to rub dirty/sand into your hands. It will stick to the sticky juice and you won't have to deal with the stickiness any longer. You might be able to rub some of the dirt off, bringing some stickiness with it as well.
How do I eat a mango without getting sticky?
Using a special cutting technique, it can be easily done. Just use a knife and a fork. If you use gloves, you do it more elegantly. The trick is to cut it in a special way:Cut it in halfCut a gridPut pressure on the shell. The shell of the mango is stiff to support a structure, that looks like a hedgehog.It is depicted on mango.org and explained. 
How do I remove gum from my beard?
Depending on where the gum landed, you can simply cool it quite a bit with ice, at which point it's much easier to remove with a comb. You'll need to make an ice pack in a manner that cools (close to freezing) both sides of the affected area, creative use of chopsticks and snack-sized ziplock bags might work.Solvents are of course an option, but make sure to watch out for your skin. Some folks can wash their hands with denatured alcohol 20 times a day without problems, some break out at the mere sight of petroleum jelly.Try 'freezing' (I use the term loosely because you're not really freezing anything, just really lowering the temperature) first before going with any kind of chemical is the best advice I can give. I've gotten it out of my kid's hair using ice, a beard attached to an adult with an average pain threshold should be much easier :)
How do I eat a mango without getting sticky?

How can I eat an apple without getting sticky fingers?
Counterintuitively, corn on the cob holders can be good for this.They dig into the apple directly, rather than a fork which curves and can cause difficulty in angling it right without biting into metal.
How can I sharpen pencils without a dedicated sharpener?
A rough grit sandpaper works in a pinch, as do nail files and other wood or steel files.
A book fell in a sink full of water. How can I dry it?
You can put blotting paper or white paper towels between the pages to get the water out again.
A book fell in a sink full of water. How can I dry it?
For thinner books - you can dry them with a hairdryer as described in the question, and then  iron individual pages, if they are very wrinkled. It takes only a couple seconds per page.You should then have it stand open, at the widest angle possible, to help the binding dry out well also.
How can I sharpen pencils without a dedicated sharpener?
I don't carry a knife. I have often been drawing/sketching while in a park or on a city bench near a curbside and I have found the rough pavement and/or concrete on the ground works well in a pinch (on those occasions when I don't have my sharpener with me). You're not going to get a perfect sharp tip, but it will remove the wood enough to get more of the graphite out and available for continued use.Similar, if you are near a brick building, you can use the mortar in the joints between the bricks as it provides a nice channel for the pencil to shimmy through.
A book fell in a sink full of water. How can I dry it?
Place the book vertically in sunlight so that the water can drain out and the book can dry up. Flip the pages at regular intervals to ensure uniform drying. If the pages still seem wrinkled when the book is almost dry (depends on the texture of paper), place a tissue on the wrinkled page and lightly iron it at a low temperature. Do this to straighten all the pages which seem wrinkled.
How can I sharpen pencils without a dedicated sharpener?
You're doing it wrong.  Most artists I know use a pen knife to sharpen pencils.  The trick is to only bear down on the wooden part and cut along a shallow angle.  To finish the graphite point, use extremely light pressure.How to sharpen a pencil with a knife
How can I tell if an egg has gone bad without cracking it open?
I place the egg in a glass of water.If it floats, it is bad. If it stands up, use it for cooking (e.g. a hard boiled egg but not soft), it's getting old. If it sinks, you're safe.Why?The outer shell of an egg has two membranes under it. When an egg is laid, it is warm and starts cooling which contracts the inner part of the egg more than the shell and pulls the two membranes apart. As a result, air gets trapped in between the membranes (there is not enough air initially for it to float).SourceAs this egg gets older, air is taken in (due to slightly higher pressure from the contractions) through pores in the egg. Eventually, bacteria will get in too. When the egg has enough air to float, it's probably gone bad with the bacteria.Image © Tim, 2014
How do I open a bottle without a bottle opener?
Anything hard with an edge can be used to lever the cap off with a tight enough grip on the bottle.Possible things you might have around while camping:A spoonA lighterA knifeA rock
How do I open a can without a can opener?
I hope you're not camping without a knife. A sturdy knife can be used to slice the top off. Be careful of the edges!If you don't have a knife or anything else sharp your options are limited. Your best bet might be to find a pointy rock, and bash it into the top of the can with another rock, gradually 'chiseling' out the top of the can.But if you've managed to get yourself into this situation, how are you camping somewhere with power and a data-connection but no knife? May I suggest a new hobby?
A book fell in a sink full of water. How can I dry it?
Air drying the book is probably your best bet to avoid any structural damage. Find a cool and dry room with good air circulation, and use a fan to keep the air circulating.This description from the University of Delaware Library below provides a great step-by-step. Another great description with pictures was produced by the Cornell University Library.When a Book is SaturatedStand the book on its head [the top edge of the book] with absorbent paper [preferably a paper towel] beneath itOpen only the covers slightly to allow the book to stand. If the book    cannot stand alone, support it with bookends.Place absorbent paper inside the front and back covers (between the    text block and covers)Do not try to separate the pages while they are very wet.

How can I accelerate the ripening of bananas?
Store them in a paper bag. They will all emit ethylene gas as they ripen. Trapped inside the bag, the gas will accelerate the ripening process as it cannot escape.
How do I remove burned-on gunk from an enamel stove-top without using harmful chemicals?
I always find a lot of gunk shifts much easier once it is warm or hot. So start to heat the top and then try cleaning it (taking care not to burn yourself).
How can I test for electrical current through bare wires without a meter?
Theoretically, you could take a lightbulb (or nightlight, phone charger, etc.) and touch the wires to the bulb base or plug.HOWEVER: DO NOT ATTEMPTThis would be EXTREMELY dangerous: you could die from the electrical shock. Even experienced electricians and crazy people don't do such a thing!In conclusionThis is one reason there are breaker switches: so you can safely work on wiring, etc. without dying.To answer your original question with a good and safe idea: Don't do it! Use the proper equipment.
What is the best way of cleaning the glass on a wood burning stove?
My personal favourite is to start the next fire, and before the fire gets too hot (after 5 mins?), clean the glass with a cheap scourer and water. If the glass is hot enough to turn water to steam, its too hot (and you will get burned).The elbow grease required for cleaning it when it's warm, compared to cold is trivial.
How do I remove spray paint from my hands?
Since water doesn't work, then it's not a water-based paint.If it is an oil-based paint, start by rubbing cooking oil over your hands, then rub hand dish-washing detergent over the oil, then scrub.If it is a solvent-based paint, first try washing and scrubbing with rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol.  If that doesn't work then try washing and scrubbing with nail polish remover (acetone).

If I am outside with grimy hands (I used to be a landscaper and I would lay stone and would get lime/mortar or soil/sod dirt on my hands before lunch) I have often used a little bit of water and some fine grit sand (from the side of the road, a sandbox etc.). The water and sand acted as a small abrasive pad and it quickly works to exfoliate the skin removing the grime while doing so.Perhaps this would work with your paint issue as well?
If I break a water pipe, is there a way to stop the flow while I go turn off the water?
Put the stopper in the sink.This will block the flow of water completely. If you don't have a stopper, use your T-shirt or any other clothes you have on you. While this will not stop the water completely, it will drastically reduce its flow. Also, turn off the faucet.If you're talking about the flow pipe into the faucet, then wrap the pipe with duct tape if you have any.

How do I open a door that has a chainlock from the outside?
How to Open a Door Chain Lock or Bar Latch from the OutsideImage taken from the above site. The one I believe in mostly is taking a piece of string and tying it to the chain, then threading it over to the outside of the door and pulling chain open. But I can vouch that all of these methods work. For the rubber band method you can use a string that is tied, it doesn't have to be a rubber band. And if you are small you can stand on a stool and stick your hand in the door that is cracked and open the door that way. Wikihow also had a method, but it includes pushing against the door.
How do I securely tie my shoes?
More than the material used, it is the techniques that determines the tightness of a knot. A safe shoe lace knot should build a reef knot (with loops to ease opening). Unfortunately many people, including myself, obviously only learned how to make a granny knot which is not secure and easily gets loose.Both knots are extremely similar: Reef knot Granny knotSo when lacing our shoes we will easily make one or the other without realizing until it gets loose.To make a proper reef knot we need the following steps:Bend the left lace over the right and pull it through.Make the left loop and take the right end around on the front.Make the loop by pulling it thorough to the front.This can correctly be made in different ways, i.e. we may start by bending the right over the left, and then start with the right loop (see Ian's Shoelace Site for more details and step by step images).What is essential is that we had learned it the wrong way.To overcome this we need to change the directions once different to what we were used to. What I do is I start by not putting the right end over the left (this is how I erroneously got used to do it) but just start with the left end over the right. Just this alone made my knots almost always tight.
How can I accelerate the ripening of bananas?
Method 1 : Placing them in warm areaPlace and cover the bananas inside packet or bowl of rice. OrExpose the bananas to sunlight.Method 2 : Exposing to ethylene gas Place them in oven with lowest possible temperature. It will emit ethylene gas and it will accelerate the ripen process. This method usually carried out during making banana bread.(do not crowd them, Air has to circulate)Place the bananas inside a plastic bag.To be more fast, put a tomato or other fruit inside the bag. It emits more ethylene gas while ripening.
How do I sharpen a knife in the wild?
I saw a Youtube video on this a while back*....can't find it now, but I'll post whatever I remember.Basically, the way knife-sharpening works is that you shave off little bits of metal, in order to make the edge of your knife V-shaped. Ideally, you'd use a steel or a specialized stone for this, but if you don't have any, here are some things you could use instead:Top of a car windowBottom of a ceramic mug (see also this article by Lifehacker)You might use cement, but only for about two seconds, and only in place of a really coarse stone (=for beginning stage sharpening)If you're camping, you might use a straight metal tent-peg in place of a steel (my suggestion, not from the video)If you're near a river, flat river stones might help you (but try to find a big one, for ease-of-use)Also suggested by Crazy Russian Hacker, if I remember correctly, is to use a leather belt as a strop, basically running the knife backwards over the leather belt, to give it a nicer finish. This may not help you if your knife is severely out of shape, but it could work to make an almost-good knife perfect. I've done this myself when I wanted to show my knife (pictured in my gravatar) to a professional shochet, and although I had my stones with me, I didn't have time to soak them and sharpen my knife properly. I just took off my belt, ran the knife over it several times, and the knife really improved a lot. Kudos to Jon for reminding me of this hack :)I would suggest that you do NOTUse another knife, because you have a good chance of ruining at least one of your knives, if not both of them.*IIRC, it's by a guy who calls himself "Crazy Russian Hacker," but I can't find that video now

Is there a way to erase pencil without a standard eraser?
You can use a rubber band. Rubber bands remove pencil matter as well as erasers do. You have to be careful what you erase and what rubber bands you use, though. You may be able to use correction fluid (a.k.a. white out).But as long as you have a rubber band you should be okay. Also, I have observed that many rubbery objects work for this task, just make sure they don't smear the paper before use.  How not to lose your eraser: Drill a hole through the top and hang it on a string around your neck. Alternatively, stick it the rings of your notebook or strap it to your pencil with a rubber band.Additional InfoGetting pencils with erasers should eliminate this problem, though.

Is there a way to erase pencil without a standard eraser?
In the past, people have used balled up, de-crusted, moist bread:Crustless bread was used as an eraser in the past; a Meiji-era  (1868-1912) Tokyo student said: "Bread erasers were used in place of  rubber erasers, and so they would give them to us with no restriction  on amount. So we thought nothing of taking these and eating a firm  part to at least slightly satisfy our hunger."Source. See also this article in the New Yorker.

What's the easiest way to peel frozen ginger?
Wait for the skin to thaw, but the interior is still frozen. That way, you can peel them without fear or getting too much/digging in. Putting it in a bowl of warm water for a few seconds gives a more uniform thaw than just setting it out.And it's not that big a pain to do with a sharp paring knife, but you could try to use a dedicated vegetable peeler, I suppose.

How do I fold a fitted sheet?
To fold a fitted sheet: Stand holding the sheet by the two adjacent corners of one of the shorter edges. With the sheet inside out, place one hand in each of  these two corners.Bring your right hand to your left, and fold the corner in your right hand over the one in your left, enveloping it. Next, reach down  and pick up the corner that is hanging in front; bring it up, and fold  it over the two corners in your left hand; the corner that's showing  will be inside out.Bring the last corner up, and fold it over the others; with its right side showing, it should envelop the other three corners.Lay the folded sheet on a flat surface and straighten it into the shape shown.Fold the two edges in so all the elastic is hidden.Fold the sheet into a rectangle.Continue folding until the rectangle is the size you want it to be.Although this is from Martha Stewart, my wife and I have done it this way for years.There's a video explaining the process at http://youtu.be/_Z5k9nWcuFc

What's the easiest way to peel frozen ginger?
It is usually easier to peel while fresh with a vegetable peeler in my opinion. But for this problem:Do it while the skin is dry and the ginger has just a bit of give to it. Use a very sharp knife(a peeler will only work when the ginger is thawed). You could grate it, but this is just a suggestion. A thing someone did because they had really big roots was grate the skin off. When you need to use the ginger, you can grate it while it's still  frozen. In fact, ginger is easier to work with while frozen as it is  less fibrous.Additional InfoWikiHow

The vinegar kills any mold spores and other bacteria that might be on  the surface of the fruitFoxnews.com:Dry produce, you can keep them dry after washing them in vinegar by putting them in a strainer, drying every individual fruit and placing towels and paper towels around them. Moisture leads to mould even in the refrigerator. It's a good idea to wash fresh greens, but tossing them in the fridge  while damp may make them soggyStore ethylene producing products properlyCertain fruits and vegetables release ethylene, which speeds the  ripening process. Apples, apricots, cantaloupe, and honeydew are best  kept in the fridge to keep them fresh longer. But store separate from  greens! The ethylene emitted will wilt your future salad.Don't bruise themStore them at the proper temp.  Watch out for cold-sensitive items. Storing potatoes, onions, and  garlic in cool, dark spots elongates life for up to a month. But these  cold-sensitive items don't do well in the fridge, where temps dip too  low for their liking.For Grapes:Put grapes on a paper towel. Grapes have a tendency to mold due to  moisture build-up. Remove grapes from the bag or container the fruit  came, wash, and gently pat dry. Place on a paper towel in an open  container and pop in the fridge.For berries:Remove berries from containers. Berries are delicate things, and don't  like moisture. Remove from containers they came in, gently wash and  pat dry, and place in a single layer on a paper towel in an open  container. Store in the fridge.For Citrus:Store citrus fruits on the counter. Citrus fruits do just fine when  stored at room temperature. Instead of displaying in a bowl, simply  let the fruit hang out on the counter to resist mold growth.Additional InfoPopsugar.com
How to make washed fruit last longer in the refrigerator?
Pat them with paper or cloth towels to remove the excess water before storing them. Use a sealed container lined with paper towels for storing the fruit in the refrigerator. Paper towels absorb the excess moisture and prevent the fruit from rotting. In case you don't have a sealed container, you can use fridge storage bags lined with paper towels to store the fruit.Regularly check the container and change the paper towels because natural moisture of the fruit will build up and the paper towels will become moist. If you don't change them, the fruit will rot due to the excess moisture.However, avoid storing fruits for too long, they are best eaten fresh.

How do I remove spray paint from my hands?
The great secret to removing paint (and other nasty's like pine tar, stains, glues etc.) Is to not let the substance contact your skin. (not a SA reply read on please) While a latex glove is the simplest way of doing this, it is not always the most practical. And even if you do use a glove like this you are still more likely than not going to get paint on your skin. Before painting use an oily hand lotion or something of that nature. I used to use a product I would get at an industrial supplier, I forget the exact brand named but it was called 'liquid glove'. With this stuff I used to stain furniture with a rag, putting my whole bare hand in the pale, and soap and water was all I needed.However any hand lotion or safe oily stuff you can apply to your hands will make the job of cleaning up your hands afterwards easier.

How can I keep my door locks from freezing during a winter storm?
It depends on the lock and the reason it freezes. Some locks just come stuck when they get cold, but most get stuck because there is some liquid in them (like from the snowstorm) that then expands and makes the lock stuck.In this cases it has helped me a lot to put something over the lock. Like use some leather or thick! cloth and attach it (e.G. nail it to the door above the lock) so that the lock is covered. The better the cover the more it will help.
How can I remove sticky residue left by a vinyl sticker from the back of my iPad?
Go to the store and buy some product that will work, but since that is not a real answer and most products apparently don't work that well: The best fix is Alcohol. It is everyday and simple and I have proven it to work.Use Vodka (or better still, isopropyl alcohol / rubbing alcohol) - It takes hard work and rubbing and may take sometime.While Goo Gone can take down any residue with a few strokes, I've  found that it leaves its own oily residue behind that's just as hard  to remove as the original glue (and forget about washing it off your  fingers). If you're willing to take an extra 60 seconds or so, vodka  will save you the hassle and leave you with a clean, shiny finish when  you're done. Of course, if you don't have any vodka handy, you can  always try a pencil eraser too.So Goo Gone may not work that well and pencil erasers can work. Use Baking Soda and cooking oil. These are products everyone has and are cheap, simple and quick. Create a mixture of equal parts baking soda and cooking oil. Put the  mixture on top of the label you want to remove. Wait at least 30  minutes. Then, scrub off the bottle and the glue is gone. Finally,  wash the bottle to remove the oil and baking soda.And of course the other answer outlines the best household product. Alcohol- Is apparently the best, like I said. the rubbing alcohol was far and away the best we triedLighter fluidThe lighter fluid was the worst, though we expect it's because  Ronsonol lighter fluid—the most commonly recommended—no longer  contains naphtha, the solvent that made it so effective (Update: This  is true, Ronsonol doesn't contain naphtha, but we also got the wrong  kind of lighter fuel, which is the real source of the problem)WikiHow- Had some of my favourite fixes. Steam(gives a incomplete fix, most times)Fast Food Hand wipesCredit Card scrapers(won't fix the problem unless you take time for it and they still need some products to finish the job. Essential oils(this may effect your paint on the phone, oils like tea tree oil can burn through Styrofoam and plastic so beware. Rubbing with your fingers takes a while and make not work completely. It is basically you rubbing your fingers against the bottle until it rubs off. 
How can I safely grate a small food item without cutting my fingers?
Pick some scrap wood (preferably hardwood, about 1cm thick) and cut out a piece thats about 4cmx4cm, on one side make deep (2mm) grooves. Clean them carefully so you don't get splinters in your cheese.Then place the wood with the grooves down, perpendicular to the direction of movement, on the cheese and you have a fine handle.If something quicker is required use some leather thing you have. The leather is sturdy enough not to fall into your food and thick enough not to cut your fingers. Of course it can get holes while being applied.

Get a plastic grater. These will be kinder to your fingers and though they are only 5.75 and similar prices you will probably have to buy more of them, due to the fact that they are plastic and plastic keeps less than  metal and similar hardier products.

How can you get your car as cool as possible on a hot summer day without air conditioning?
Open the window on the passenger side door for about 2 inches.Rapidly open and close the drivers side door a few times.The opening and closing of the doors makes sure the air gets pushed and pulled out of the car. On a hot day, most of the heat forms by getting trapped inside your car. So when the cars inside air gets to be the same temperature as the outside air, the temperature has dropped a few degrees.As to cooling it down even more, dangle icecubes in small bags in front of your blower exhausts.

How to spread or melt hard butter
Warm the knifeEver heard the phrase "like a hot knife through butter"? Warm the knife by dipping it in hot or boiling water, and the butter will be easier to spread because it is warmed on the knife.Pre-spread the butterTake some butter and use the knife to spread it about a bit on the inside of the lid of the butter container. (If it's really hard, start by squashing it with the knife.) Then scoop it up and spread again. After a few repeats the butter should be soft enough to spread on your bread.You can see a (short - 37 seconds) video demonstrating this technique here.This is the technique I personally use and it works great. I actually use the block of butter itself to spread on, rather than the inside of the lid, but either works.Use a cheese graterGraters are designed for grating harder objects, like cheese. They work perfectly on hardened butter, and the grated strands of butter are thin enough that they can be easily spread afterwards.Source.There are even fancy knives you can buy that grate the butter as you go, if you are so inclined:Source.Warm the butterI'm assuming you don't have time to leave the butter to soften at room temperature or you wouldn't be asking the question. However, you can put a small block of butter in the microwave for a few seconds (1-10 depending on size of butter and microwave power), which should be enough to soften it so that it can be easily spread.Source.

How can you get your car as cool as possible on a hot summer day without air conditioning?
A couple of options to just cool yourself, and not the whole vehicle:If it's a short journey, wet your hair and ears beforehand with cold water. Your ears contain a large quantity of blood vessels and are very sensitive to heat.The best way of cooling yourself is to cool the arteries in your wrists, but that is typically more complicated to do while driving. Wrapping a cold cloth around them could help, but wet hair and ears is much less obstructive to your ability to drive.Another alternative is to cool your face with a small personal fan, consider attaching it to the dashboard and point it at your face. Be sure to keep it far enough away that the air doesn't force you to close your eyes while driving though,
How do I avoid the crumbs at the bottom of the cereal box?
In addition to using a colander to filter out the crumbles, you could try making the storage place a little bit damper. When cereal dries up, small bits of it will chip off, but if the surrounding air is damp enough so that they don't dry up, there won't be as many crumbs generated. It's hard to control though. You could use the cookie-bread method where you put a piece of bread into a sac of cookies and they absorb extra moisture from the bread. Same should apply to cereal.
How can I keep my door locks from freezing during a winter storm?
A built-in lock can be defrosted by pouring heated non-freezing liquid into the keyhole, such as the car antifreeze or windshield cleaning liquid. Then when the door is open, you can think of changing the lock to an external type.For an external or handheld type of lock (the one that is not inside a door, but outside of it), theoretically, you could submerge the whole lock into a liquid that has a very low freezing temperature, so low that it actually won't freeze at all during the winter. But be careful with the chemical composition that may damage your lock.Normally, you could just heat the lock up by burning pieces of paper under it for some time.
How do I eat an orange without getting sticky?
How about wearing those plastic gloves that grocery store workers have? They are cheap and sold in bulk at supermarkets. While you're at it, you could also equip yourself with plastic protective goggles so that the orange juice droplets don't get in your eyes.But that is protecting yourself from the orange. You could try the opposite − protecting the orange from everything else. Put the orange in a plastic bag and operate it from the outside. That way you can take the peel off and keep 100% of the orange body inside the bag during the process.
What is a permanent solution for black mold?
Removing the cause of the problem rather than the problem itself is the only real solution to permanently remove mould .For mould the usual culprit is moisture. In most cases the moisture will come from one of two places:If the moisture is coming from the air (e.g. a steamy bathroom or a cold hallway) the problem is managed (perhaps not completely fixed) by removing moisture from the air. To remedy this you can try:Use an electric dehumidifier (the little salt block ones simply aren't efficient enough)Keep the area well ventilated, open windows and doorsDon't add moisture unnecessarily, e.g. use an extractor fan if cooking or showering generates a lot of steam.If the moisture is coming through the walls, floor or ceiling, the problem is much more difficult and will probably require a professional damp proofing course.You will also need to remove the mould completely to reduce the chance of spores multiplying again. The chemical sprays you use already are probably enough for this.

How can I soften hard soil enough to insert short plastic stakes?
Take a tent stake or chisel with a diameter just a little smaller than the lamp spike and  with a hammer or sledge pound a new hole into the ground.
How to cover nail holes effectively and inexpensively?
If your goal is to fill in the hole with a color that matches the paint, without having to actually use any paint. then your best solution is probably going to be either using a bar of soap, or wax from a candle.As long as you can get the color of the soap or wax to match the color of the wall, no one should be able to tell that it's there unless they happen to touch it.What you would do is take the bar of soap or wax that matches the color of the wall, and for the soap you can just rub the it around the nail hole to fill it with the shavings, or  like with the wax just take a knife and cut a piece to press into the hole.Both the soap shavings and wax should be malleable enough to shape if you have a textured wall. Allowing you to hide it even more.If you're having trouble finding soap that matches the right color, you can look for a place that sells homemade or organic soap. They will usually create different colored soaps than the typical white or blue soaps in convenience stores. If you're feeling really crafty, you can melt soap and mix in colors yourself. If you're really adamant about using this method, you can create your own soap.Wax is easier to find. just buy a cheap candle. But typically you're only going to find white candles if you're looking for the cheap/small ones. Luckily, it's really easy to melt wax and add some food coloring to it in order to get the desired color that you want.
How can I soften hard soil enough to insert short plastic stakes?
Wait until the ground thaws?The garden isn't really doing much right now with a frozen surface anyways so perhaps the lighting of the barren landscape can wait until the spring?If it must be done now, try a pen/pencil, stick, screwdriver, the broken light, or any other sharp pointy thing you have and scratch at the soil until you get to the depth you need.

How to remove tree roots
My personal experience and I have not found a simple wayI used to be some sort of teenage lumber jack(not kidding) and removing trees was the easy part, but the stump was the real pain. The trick is first kill the stump:I used a Husqvarna 450 to cut the tree down and into pieces. A 450(I think that is what it used) and larger models may be tough for you to use if you are of smaller stature(the guy that really handled it well was about 6 feet so you get the picture). Now that you have a stump we would leave this for a while to rot away and become softer. But depending on your time limit there are 2 courses of action:Wait and let it rot and then pick away at it with a pickaxe(the one I used mostly had a 8 pound head). To assist it in rotting you may use chemicals. From thisoldhouse.com:There are several chemicals available at garden centers that will  hasten the rotting of a tree stump. This basically involves drilling a  series of holes in the stump and adding the chemicals.Take the chainsaw and cut the stump around the roots. This loosens the stump now take a pickup truck or something(animals may work to) and begin to pull the stump up. Do this slowly and as the stump comes up use the chainsaw or a saw to cut the roots as they come. Make sure you brush the roots off though, because dirt can be disastrous to a chainsaw. You may want to wait a while(couple of weeks) for this method to get the best results. From thisoldhouse.comUse a fire ring: Fire rings are inexpensive and can burn the stump down if you tend the fire well enough. Fire only burns the surface of the root. Fire: People sometimes use scrap wood to start a fire on top of a  stump and keep it going until the stump is gone. This is a great idea  if you have a few stumps to remove, have scrap wood you want to get  rid of and want to keep warm for the weekend. Remember to check with  local officials on the time of year when you're allowed to burn in  your area.And this method. It is not really a Lifehack, but to remove your stumps you may opt for this:Backhoe/skidsteer Sometimes if stumps are in planting areas we will  pull them with a backhoe. This is the costliest way to remove stumps,  although the expense can be kept to a minimum if you have a lot of  stumps to do and a place to bury them on site. Burying eliminates the  cost of hauling stumps away and disposing of them off-site. Bear in  mind that it is inadvisable to bury stumps in a wetlands area, and  remember too that no matter where you bury a stump, the area is going  to settle sooner or later. Of course, having a backhoe on your  property does create a large mess, so I usually only do this on new,  large construction areas. Small- to medium-size stumps can be removed  quickly with a skidsteer machine. A bucket with teeth or the pallet  fork attachment will pop the stump out, which you can then gather in  the bucket and bury on site. Skidsteers are available for rent, but  backhoes usually are not.And the Stump Grinder:Stump grinder: This is a machine that literally chews up stumps 6 to  12 inches below ground level. A set of carbide teeth makes quick work  of small- to medium- size stumps; large ones will take a little time.  I remove all the grindings to the compost pile and fill the craters  with loam. If you enjoy running such equipment, these machines are  available at rental houses. If machinery is not your thing, or you  only have one or two stumps to do, many arborists have stump grinders  and will do the grinding on a per-stump-inch price basis. If you have  many stumps to get rid of, a stump grinder is the most economical way  to go. Make sure you get complete instructions on how to operate the  machinery and wear appropriate safety equipment.Additional InfoNatural ways to remove the stumpWikihow:How to kill and dig up a tree root. 
Cleaning a dirty computer screen
Depending on how dirty it is, I use an old sock.I find that the static created by the sock is very good at picking up the dust from the screens. I keep one on my desk all the time.
How can you get your car as cool as possible on a hot summer day without air conditioning?
If the AC is gone and your stuck in traffic there is really no good way to keep the car cooler outside of keeping the windows open. However the way to have a car as cool as possible is to keep the car cooler when you are parked. Park in the shade if possible. Leave windows cracked, or open if your car is in a safe place and use a solar shield in the windshield.Window tinting also helps to keep the car cooler, however window tinting often has local regulations about how dark it can be. 
How to quickly dry wet sneakers?
Secure the sneakers to the lid of your car's trunk (boot for you English speakers). Duct tape works well for this purpose. Drive down the road at highway speeds. As long as it isn't raining or snowing, the air flow off the roof of your vehicle will remove the moisture very quickly. Note: the more humid the air, the longer this process can take.Note: using a non-paved road will definitely kick up dust which may make the sneakers muddy.You may need to look at after using this procedure: Removing duct tape from my car without paint damage?
Removing duct tape from my car without paint damage?
It won't damage the paint unless the car needs a new paint-job. It will leave a residue, however, which you need to remove. You have to use a solvent for that. Don't use a scraper, as that will scratch, and can cause conditions for rust to develop.If the paint is loose, you cannot remove the tape without removing a little paint also.
Removing duct tape from my car without paint damage?
I use grease. Something thick and oily is helpful, because it adheres to the fibres of the tape and makes it hard for it to attach to a surface. Some people say use gasoline or other oily substances.I looked around and found I had the following options. WD 40, Olive  Oil, Carnauba wax. The WD40 did not work for me. What did work was to  repeatedly soak the area in olive oil, then rub aggressively with a  microfiber cloth and then I put carnauba wax on top of it which  finished the job. The oil and wax slowly dissolved the tape glue. It  took repeated rubbing over the area. In my case it took 45 min. but it  got all the tape residue off and the finish was fine.The below comment may ruin your paint, so no. Here are the things I tried that you guys suggested for the duct tape  removal, baby oil, lighter fluid and wd 40 - no luck! I didn't try the  vegetable oil or peanut butter. Here is your solution: Nail Polish  Remover Easy, hardly any elbow grease was used. Works Beautifully,  don't bother with anything else.So I would say first scrape the tape off and then use some sort of grease(carnauba wax, mineral oil) to get the final sticky pieces with it. 
How can I efficiently plant seeds in my garden without placing them by hand?
For small gardens, don't worry about it: over-seed and just thin the rows after the sprouts come up. You almost certainly are buying more seeds than you have room to plant anyway, and storing extras for next year will result in fewer of them sprouting (which means you'll want to overseed anyway!)You can reduce mistakes (dropping half your seeds in one spot) for smaller seeds by cutting just the corner out of an ordinary mailing envelope, putting your seeds inside it, and giving it a small shake to dispense a few seeds before moving along. For larger gardens, invest in a garden seeder with plates for the various seed-sizes you intend to plant. 
How can I efficiently plant seeds in my garden without placing them by hand?
Roll out some toilet paper, and put a drop of flour paste (1) to the correct spacing of the crop you're trying to plant. Do this entirely on one side (imagine it divided into quarters the long way, place these drops between the first crease from the edge, 1/4 of the way in. It doesn't have to be rocket science).Then, get the seed in your hand, and drop two seeds (or one if you're an optimist) on each drop. Fold the paper over the long way, so that the seeds are sandwiched. Wait until this has dried before planting. The nice thing about this is that it gives you a little something to do the winter before, and it will be all ready in spring. It actually doesn't take long.(1) Flour paste recipe:Add 1 part flour to 2 parts water in appropriately sized container. Mix well.Use as soon as possible.Don't add salt. This will harm the plants as they emerge. Once you've made your seed tapes, and they're thoroughly dry, store them in airtight plastic containers, with packets of desiccant, to keep the humidity down, and prevent mold. Keep them in cool to room temperature conditions, in a consistent environment. Try to use them within a year.
What's the best way to keep your shirt tucked in?
You could buy shirt stays...But that's not very hacky. So I recommend using safety pins to attach your shirt to your underwear. My personal solution is to never tuck my shirt in. You might think this would make you look sloppy, however you can avoid this fate by judicious cultivation of unkempt facial hair to distract folks' attention.
What is the quickest way to defrost a frozen chicken breast?
Tim asks (in response to Mooseman's answer):Is warm water safe [if you] get it out in the morning and eat in the evening...?If you need to reduce the defrosting time a bit but don't need the meat immediately, just submerge the chicken in a water-filled metal container and put it in your refrigerator. The water will improve heat conduction without bringing the temperature up so high that it creates dangerous conditions for bacteria growth. If you were planning on brining your chicken, you can do this at the same time.
How do I vacuum under furniture without moving it?
If you're not dead-set against moving the furniture, you could use furniture sliders - on most carpets, they'll allow you to single-handed move even heavy pieces of furniture without undue effort, and can be left in place between vacuumings. That's not very hacky though, so...Use a leaf blower - even inexpensive models can exceed 150MPH and 200CFM, creating a fast-moving air current suitable for moving dust bunnies out of hard-to-reach places. If you don't have a leaf blower but your vacuum has a blower function, you can try that too - you probably won't get as much velocity, but for short carpets and small pieces of furniture it may suffice. Other options include air compressors and power-washers. J. Musser notes that you should avoid gas-powered blowers, as the exhaust may prove dangerous in poorly-ventilated areas. Also, spilled gas can ruin your carpets.Once you've blown out the dust, just vacuum it up as you clean the rest of the carpet.
How to quickly dry wet sneakers?
Throwing them in the dryer is obviously the quickest and easiest way (assuming you have one), but as you ruled that out due to the fact that you don't want to dirty your drier up, you'll just have to simulate the experience.First off, loosen the laces a bit and pull the tongue out to expose the interior of the shoe as best you can. From there, you have a few options, but they pretty much all boil down to "apply air and/or heat".If it's winter and you have the heater running, or its summer and you have the air conditioning blowing, place them upside down on top of the heating/cooling vent.If it's a particularly sunny day, put them out on some concrete or blacktop.If all else fails, put them in front of a fan.
Is there a way I can take a macro picture without a macro lens?
You can actually flip the lens around and use it as a macro lens that way.Since it's not going to be connected to the camera body, you're obviously going to lose the ability to zoom, and you'll have to focus by moving the camera to and from the object, but it actually works quite well once you get the hang of it.The only thing I've found that's a pain is keeping the aperture open.sourceThe aperture is closed by default, and opened using a little switch in the part of the lens that connect to the camera body. You can kind of see it in the picture above, it's on the right next to the screw. You'll have to hold that switch open in order to let enough light in through the lense to take any pictures.Just be warned, there's a big downside to using this method, because you're holding the lense out in the open like that you're allowing dust and dirt to get into it.You can get lens reversal kits, which are cheaper than getting an actual macro lens. All they'll do is allow you to connect the lens on backwards, and protect the backside of your lense from dust.
How do I vacuum under furniture without moving it?
You could use a "hoseless" vacuum cleaner, in other words, leaf blower, combined with vacuum cleaner. It could be quite useful to pull all the dust from under your furniture, if the hose of your usual vacuum cleaner can't "creep" under your furniture (because the furniture could have small legs).Examples of such machines can be seen here (I suspect you don't want to use diesel ones inside your house, so I linked to electric ones :) ).
How do I remove burned-on gunk from an enamel stove-top without using harmful chemicals?
Use a sturdy fork to chip off most of it, until you can see patches of enamel showing through. Then spread a layer of hand soap over the area, and lay a wet cloth over it to prevent drying. In half an hour, return, and use the cloth to wipe off the loosened gunk. There may be a little left, which you can easily scrub off, or repeat the above procedure.
How can I add oil to a car without a funnel?
Modern plastic 1 quart oil bottles have the funnel built in. In the old days of one quart cans of oil, you either used a spout or opened the can with a can opener and poured into a funnel.You will note that on a modern oil container the spout is offset to one side. The design is meant to place close to the oil opening of the engine and once started you simply tilt it up vertical inserting the spout into the opening. While the use of a funnel may be necessary on some engines because of an awkward oil cap placement, generally speaking using a funnel to add oil is reinventing the wheel, and will cause more mess and problems then it solves. 
Removing duct tape from my car without paint damage?
The residue left behind can be removed with rubbing alcohol and a soft rag. Little rubbing should be needed.WD-40 also works to counteract the adhesive and help the residue come off, also rubbing with a soft rag.Reference: http://www.ehow.com/way_5136188_way-tape-residue-car-body.html

How can I add oil to a car without a funnel?
If you want a quick solution that is easily reusable, and can work for all your fluids (Gas, Windshield fluid, ect.) try using a water pistol.Just fill the pistol with whatever fluid you need, and point the nozzle right into whatever spout your car might have, no matter how difficult it is to reach.While it depends on what you have to hand, I'd recommend a smaller, more handheld model for easy portability and manoeuvrability for those hard to reach spouts.What I might recommend:
How can I soften hard soil enough to insert short plastic stakes?
Without tools of any kind, you will be unable to do this. One thing I've done (unconventional) Is to use a battery drill and big boring bit. Drill straight down into the soil. It'll be dull later, but you can use it for this purpose later if necessary. Then you boil some water, and pour it down the hole. It will thaw some of the surrounding soil, and mix to form mud. You have to put the stake in quickly, as the warmth doesn't last long. The hole should be full of mud, which will freeze, holding the stake up.If the frozen layer isn't deep, you don't need boiling water.
Improvised glasses
I found this Lifehacker article with a good answer.Pinhole Reading GlassesPut your index finger, middle finger, and thumb into a circle and leave a small hole in the middle (the three fingers of the same hand allow a tiny triangular opening which is held less than one inch from the eye). Bring the hole to your eye and look through.How this worksBy doing this you are limiting the amount of light going through the lens in your eye. This gives slight magnification and increases your range (depth of field) of clear vision.
How do I get the bin bag (trash bag) outside without it dripping all over me?
Use two bags per load. When the bin is full, tie off the top tightly, so that nothing can leak out, and then open another bag over the top, dumping the first bag into the second. Tie it off, and carry it off. The first bag should be upside down inside the second.Pro: You use up the nasty bags twice as fast! :P
How do I quickly thaw the ice in frozen pipes?
Obviously, you must heat the area where the pipe is frozen.First, try turning on the faucets. If water flows, run warm water through the pipes and this should thaw the pipe.If this doesn't work locate where the frozen part of the pipe is. Check in either the basement (if it is unheated), or places where the pipe goes outside. Heat the frozen part using a hair dryer, or even by pouring warm water over it.
How do I get the bin bag (trash bag) outside without it dripping all over me?
Just tell me, you can predict what could be the cause of the leak? Then you can just put all the possible leakers (I don't think you would have really many of them) in additinal small cellophane bags. I, for example, have a big roll of those bags and sometimes use them in the case something I bin would leak.
How can I make sure I get the USB plug in the right way up?
USB ports are usually designed with the "reading" part (the "tongue" inside the port) located more close to the top than bottom so as you have to plug USB in them with the two square deep holes  (on the front side) looking at the top.And if (happens rarely) the "tongue" is located more close to the bottom of the port, insert the USB in it with its bottom side up.In other words, those big holes on USB  must contact with the side of the port, to which the "tongue" inside the port is closer.By front side I assume this position:image source
How can I improvise sunglasses?
Two ways of improvising sunglasses1. Make Slit SunglassesSlit sunglasses work by limiting the upper and lower angles of light coming into your eyes.  To improvise these glasses you can use the cover of a paperback book, plastic cards or some other stiff but bendable material. Make the slits with a penknife. The nose and earpieces can be constructed of string, rubber bands, twist ties or the material itself.2. Make Pinhole SunglassesPinhole sunglasses work by limiting the total amount of light that come to your eyes. However, due to the pinhole effect you still have a full field of vision, although you may have some visual artifacts where the two visual fields meet.  Pinhole glasses also have the advantage of correcting your vision, also thanks to the pinhole effect.You can make pinhole glasses out of the same material as slit sunglasses and use a safety pin or bit of stiff wire to make the holes.
How can I make sure I get the USB plug in the right way up?
If you're like me, you're usually plugging the same USB plug into the same port again and again.  So just mark the "top" side of the plug with a bit of tape, a marker or a dot of fingernail polish so it is easily identifiable.
How do I quickly thaw the ice in frozen pipes?
Heat the area where the pipe is frozen. Here are some tips:Drape a heating pad over the pipe (assuming it is dry on the outside)Use a hair dryer on the areaPlace a space heater in a safe place near (but not dangerously close to) the pipeRunning the water down the line will help the process go more quickly. (Running water is not frozen water, and therefore is warmer than what you're trying to melt. As the running water passes the ice, it lends some heat energy to the ice, helping to melt it from the inside).But be aware that there is always a chance the pipe may explode. Also be sure you know where the water turns off up the line, just in case.
How can I make sure I get the USB plug in the right way up?
Write an "X" with a marker, or place a small piece of masking tape on the side that should be on top.You can also use a USB extension cable so that you can hold, and look into, both sides when connecting them.

There may be inexpensive, and mayn times reusable screw terminals available in the region you live: Image source WikipediaThis will ensure a firm connection of electrical wires needing only a screw driver (and a tool to remove insulation at the ends) to fit them.A drawback of these screw terminals is their very limited safety. Conductive parts may be exposed, and touching them will cause a shock of course. In addition those contacts are not suitable for moist or wet environments.To increase safety we can wrap them in insulating tape or (preferrably) put them in a box.

The easiest way to do this is with a vacuum cleaner. Use the hose, but put a thin piece of fabric (such as tights/pantyhose) over the end, fastened with a rubber band. Make sure you adjust the air inlet on the hose so that the engine isn't working too hard and doesn't overheat.Use the covered hose to slowly work over the carpet, under furniture and in crevices to retrieve the pearls. They will be sucked up, but stay 'stuck' to the end of the hose, where you can grab them off, or just turn off the suction briefly while you hold it over a bowl to collect them.

How to open a door without it creaking?
You should lubricate the hinge and doorknob mechanism with oil. GT-85 or other teflon-containing lubricants are the best. If you're not in a position to do that:WikiHow:Take light, slow steps as you are opening the door. That way, no one  will hear the squeak of the floorboards and/or tile as you enter the  room.Be careful when turning the doorknob because some doorknobs can be  very noisy as you turn and let go. If it is noisy, turn very slowly  and let go slowly, only releasing when it is back in its original  position.Turn the doorknob so that the least rotation is needed. If the hinges  are on the right, rotate the doorknob clockwise. If the hinges are on  the left, rotate the doorknob counterclockwise. This holds true  whether the door opens toward you or away from you.After you turn the doorknob, press the door upward and then toward the  hinges in rapid succession as you open the door. This will help to  reduce the noise the door makes as it separates from the jamb.Jamming the door upward and toward the hinges immobilizes it and makes the chance of squeaking unlikely.

How can I prevent the bin bag falling into the bin?
Take a band and tie it around the bag and container so the bag is now held up. This works better if you have a rim on the container. What usually works for me is:Rubber BandsParacord tiedAny cheap rope, because you can just pitch it afterwards. Thrifty fun:Binder Clips- One day, I took binder clips (the black or colored clips with silver  bars that you get in office supply stores) and used two clips, one on  each side on the garbage can rim, clipping the bag to the can. I  flipped the bars down. They easily went on and I was able to close the  lid. It has worked like a charm. I can now use any type of bag that is  on sale. By Shardebhow from Cherry Hill, NJUsing elastic- You can take elastic and wrap a length around the container. Use the right size bags. If you use a large bag on a small container it falls in.Also, make tape handles for the bag and attach to the outside of the container. 
How can I clean a vase that I can't reach inside?

How to open a door without it creaking?
The squeaking noise is often made by friction as the hinges rub. If that's the case, I will turn the doorknob and pull straight up, basically lifting the door so that it presses against the top of the hinges, which are less likely to squeak.
Open a suitcase with a numeric lock when you forgot the key code
Grab the lock with your left hand (so that opening lever points to the right.) in a way that your finger tips bring tension on the lock. You will need a high amount of tactile impressions on your fingers.Now with your right hand rightmost finger (the small one) push that opening lever to the right, again to bring tension on the mechanism.Then carefully twist the numbers. Start with the rightmost one. You will feel a slightly different impression when the opening slot for the correct number rolls into place. This procedure will take some time (most likely you will need 3 - 4 rotations of each wheel until you get the feel of it.If tactile did not work place your ear close to the lock and repeat, you will hear a scratch when transitioning from a wrong to a wrong number but a more clicky sound when transitioning from a wrong to a correct number.As a sidenote: Such locks are totally worthless if you want to prevent theft or anything like that. The only thing that they do is keep the zipper shut while its on board. See this video on how easy it is to break a zipper. The reason the locks are useless are that the zipper is so much easier to break into that nobody would bother to even try breaking that lock.
Open a suitcase with a numeric lock when you forgot the key code
The lock you show us has three number rings. This gives us 1000 possible combinations. So in the worst case you could simply try all of them:Start with one of the outer number rings.increase its numbers and test if you can open the case for eachif you completed a round increase the next ring by one number[rinse and repeat]Another method is this:put a little force on the opening mechanism as if you want to open it. Do this through all of the followingslowly turn the ring one by oneyou might feel that the ring get a bit harder to move in certain positions. Leave it in that position and move on to the next one.This method will not always work and is easier for low quality locks as rings might even lock into the correct position.See also Wikipedia:Locksports
How do I find all the bits of a broken necklace?
In long fiber carpet, the easiest way is to vacuum thoroughly with an upright brush vacuum cleaner, with a new/empty bag/canister.This gets it out of the long fiber carpet better than a simple suction. Also, some people have success with walking over the carpet in bare feet, covering all the area that way. However that is time consuming.
How to plug a twisted electrical wire
Connect the ends together by twisting, then wrap the junction in a plastic bag (like a ziploc freezer bag) and attach the end of the bag to the cable with electrical tape. This uses far less electrical tape (makes taking it apart easier), while protecting the cord from a short, except in the case of water.To keep the wires from falling out of the outlet, this is a safety issue, and should be avoided if at all possible. Try taping the cord to the wall near the outlet, so that if the cord gets pulled, the stress is put on the tape/wall, rather than trying to connect directly with the outlet.
How to fasten a length of plastic rope which is just too short
You can't really get a great knot with that little rope, but you can make it stronger. Here are some ideas:Melt it together. The easiest way is to use melted plastic from another source (a plastic bag perhaps) and spreading it all over the knot. The biggest problem with this: It won't come back off easily.Use a few safety pins on each knot, going through the rope on both sides of the knot. Not super strong, but it will handle drying wet laundry.Get a vicegrips and set it to squeeze tightly. Use it to squeeze the knot in place, and then just let it hang there until you wish to remove it. Much stronger, but you'll be shorter by two tools, if you even have these.Attach the rope lower down on the opposite wall, which will give you more slack and improve the chances of your ability to make a good knot.
If I break a water pipe, is there a way to stop the flow while I go turn off the water?
You are under the sink, so the following things should be readily available:bucket or large containertowelspieces of plastic (old wrappers, garbage-bag, etc.)Let me first say; do this as quickly as possible. It doesn't have to be a solid fix, and you are gonna have some spillage. The main reason for doing this is to make sure the room doesn't have 10cm of water in it before you had the chance to turn of the water:Put the bucket (or other large container) under the broken pipe.Take the piece of plastic (preferably a garbage-bag) and hold it over the hole in the pipe.Use the towels to wrap around the plastic around the pipe (you can tie them in a knot to keep everything in place).If you have pieces of string available, tie one tightly around the pipe over the towel above the break, and one below the break.Run like hell for your main shutoff-valve !
How do I get the bin bag (trash bag) outside without it dripping all over me?
I had the same problem for years, and have opted to buy new bins last year. There are a lot of bins sporting extra removable buckets in them (has something to do with being able to clean them better).When the time arrives to clean my bins, I just take the removable bucket outside, tie off my trash bag, throw it away and take the removable bucket back in the house.An old study-partner of mine always put a real bucket on the bottom of his trashcan, because he always punctured his trash bag at the bottom so it was easier to remove from the trashcan. The bucket would contain the liquids and he only had to clean that instead of the whole trashcan!

This should reduce the amount of movement, reducing the sound and risk of opening the door.Or "Why not place them both in, let the shoestring hang out and tie something different on it, so they don't fall in?" Thanks @Angelo Fuchs
How can I remove the bag from my bin more easily?
If you don't want to let air in from the bottom with holes, you need to somehow let air in from the top. An easy way to do this is by placing a hollow tube/pipe in the bin. Before you put the liner in, place the tube against the side of the bin (it should be tall enough to reach from bottom to top without preventing it from closing). This could be something rigid like PVC, or flexible like a hose. You'll lose a very slight bit of capacity, but it will prevent (or at least lessen, depending on the diameter of the tube) the vacuum effect in the bottom of the bin.Try it out a couple times. If it works well for you, you should be able to hack up a way to mount it in the bin permanently.
Is there any way to fill in a hole in my shoe - so it is waterproof?
Use duct tape on the inside under the footpad/insert. The weight of your heel will help the tape form a good seal, keeping water out.
How can I amplify the speakers of my iPhone?
The easiest way I know, when you're at home or outside and don't have any gadgets or items, is simply placing your phone next to a wall or ideally in a corner with the speakers facing the wall. The sound waves will reflect off the wall and more of them will get directly into your ear.To understand this, imagine a speaker in the middle of a room with you standing on the right side of the room. The sound waves move in all directions and only one part of them will directly get into your ear. The rest will first reflect off the left, top and bottom walls before they get into your ear. They will lose some of their loudness and will get there with some delay: You here a slight echo (of course depending on the size of the room).So if the speaker is in the corner, more of the sound waves get directly into your ear or only with a minimal delay.It isn't that much louder, than placing it in a bowl or toilet paper roll but you will still hear a difference.
How can I remove the bag from my bin more easily?
The problem is that you're creating a vacuum in the bottom of the bin. The further you pull the bag, the lower the air pressure in the bottom, thus the more it pulls back. To alleviate this issue, we need to get air to the bottom of the can.Take a yard stickInsert it on the side of the bag and push it inwards a bit, towards the bag.Pull out the garbage bag, easily.A permanent solution would be to drill a few small holes in the bottom of the can.
How can I remove the bag from my bin more easily?
Looks like you've got a pedal bin. Simply hold the bin down with the pedal as you lift out the sack. This should make it much easier to separate the two.
Open a suitcase with a numeric lock when you forgot the key code
Anaximander's answer to a question on travel.SE explains the biro technique:If your suitcase closes with a zip, then it can be opened with a normal biro (the ubiquitous cheap Bic office biro works particularly well). Simply hold the biro so it points parallel to the zip, with the nib end pointing into the zip teeth (I find about 60 degrees works). Then press down. The pen disengages the teeth of the zip, and you can pull them apart by running the pen or your finger along the zip. To reclose, simply pull the zipper over the opened part, and then back again. This works even on those suitcases with two zip pulls that lock together. Travel security like this method because it's fast, basically undetectable, and doesn't require any special tooling or any co-operation from the lock manufacturers.This could be a solution if knowledge of the lock's code will be revealed later (e.g. when a travel companion returns from an outing) allowing the zip tabs to be released and the zip teeth to be re-interlocked for normal operation.
Is there any way to fill in a hole in my shoe - so it is waterproof?
Depending on the type of hole, you can get away with using some silicon. They sell them (primarily for cars) in a container that resembles a toothpaste container. Dry your shoe thoroughly, then apply the silicon to the hole, and try to fill the entire hole. If the hole goes all the way through the shoe, then also try the duct tape on the inside to provide another layer of protection. Important thing, get the silicon in all the nooks and crannies of the hole, otherwise water will just come through. They also sell silicon in multiple colors, so for a few bucks, you can have some stylin' shoes that keep your feet dry.
How do I decelerate the ripening of bananas?
There are a number of things you can do to slow the ripening of bananas:Keep them cool - bananas will ripen less quickly in the fridgeWrap the stems in cling film - this is where most of the ripening gas ethylene comes from. Covering it will reduce the amount of gas that escapesSeparate the bananas from other fruits - Other fruits will produce even more ethylene, so keep bananas well awayDon't bruise them - bruising will break down the skin membrane, causing the release of - you guessed it - more ethylene. Consider a banana hook.
How can I accelerate the ripening of bananas?

How can I quickly eliminate the smell of cigarette smoke in a confined space?
Baking SodaIf this is just an occasional smoke, most of the smell left over is from smoke trapped in fabrics, such as carpets, curtains, etc. Sprinkling/rubbing baking soda into them can help neutralize the odor.For carpets (which will eliminate basically all the smell in most rooms), just sprinkle it over the carpet lightly. I typically then walk over it a bit to distribute it further into the pile. Wait a while (10 minutes to a few hours), and then vacuum the carpets as usual.For a more noticeable immediate effect, you can get products made specifically for this. Where I'm at they're very inexpensive, as they're mostly baking soda with an additional scent added in.As I said, this is best for an occasional smoke. For rooms that are smoked in constantly over time, there will be a smoke/soot buildup on most surfaces, which requires a deeper cleaning.
How to keep sticky notes from falling down?
Your notes are probably falling down because you separate the note you need from another note incorrectly, i.e. by pulling from the end of sticky note. Therefore sticky edge bends and the note pulls itself from the surface you stuck it to.Instead try separating it from another by pulling it off from the right or left, and try not to bend it.To elucidate this refer to the following visual:original image

Fastest way to boil water?
Things I know will work:Use a thicker pot. Use a lid. Use less water. Use higher heat. Not extraordinarily high, but if you raise the heat it should boil faster. If the heat is to high this could damage the pan. Use a pan that covers the whole stove eye. If you have a small pan on  a large eye, you are not utilizing heat properly. Additional InfoIs it true that hot water freezes faster than cold water or that cold water boils faster than hot water?"Cold water does not boil faster than hot water. The rate of heating  of a liquid depends on the magnitude of the temperature difference  between the liquid and its surroundings (the flame on the stove, for  instance). As a result, cold water will be absorbing heat faster while  it is still cold; once it gets up to the temperature of hot water, the  heating rate slows down and from there it takes just as long to bring  it to a boil as the water that was hot to begin with. Because it takes  cold water some time to reach the temperature of hot water, cold water  clearly takes longer to boil than hot water does. There may be some  psychological effect at play; cold water starts boiling sooner than  one might expect because of the aforementioned greater heat absorption  rate when water is colder.This appears correct, but I don't know I'm not a physicist. Food52.com:Keep the pot lid on. Use less water. Use higher flame. Use a thinner  stainless steel pot (these are generally bad for cooking but they  transfer heat really fast). Use an electric kettle, or microwave (be careful) to boil the water  and then pour it into your heated steaming pot.Does water boil faster with the lid on?Yes, water does boiler measurably faster with the lid on.The reason is simple: in order to boil, water must be heated to the  boiling point (okay, that was obvious). However, while heat is being  introduced at the bottom of the pot, heat is also being lost at the  top of the pot, through three means: evaporative cooling, and air  convection of heat away from the surface of the water, and radiation  from the surface (this last is probably the least significant).Does water boil faster if you put salt in the water?Yes and no. If you look at how fast water boils when you add a small  amount of salt to it, such as when cooking your noodles, the change is  insignificant between pure water and the salted water. However, if you  take two identical pots and add one gallon of pure water to one pot  and one gallon of 20 percent salt water to the other and heat the two  pots on identical stoves, the pot containing the salt water will come  to a boil first.So salt won't really work. 
How can I stop my straw rising?
Thread a Straw Through the Tab on a Soda Can to Keep It from RisingIt's as simple as turning the tab to the side and sliding the straw  through it. This keeps the straw from rising up and falling out of the  can.Take some tape, wrap it around the straw and tape it to the jar. This will stop rising and the straw is in a fixed place. Also, try getting heavier reusable straws;   this will make the straw stay down better, but may not work. If the straw has ridges, take a string, wrap it around the straw and then tie it around the cup. Getting a lid with a hole in it works too. 
How to keep sticky notes from falling down?
Here are some tips:Never touch the sticky portion. This wears away at the sticky material and can make it less prone to sticking.Clean the area you want to adhere it to. If the area you adhere it to is all dirty the note won't adhere properly.Here are some methods to make them stick:Use glue. If you use a glue stick that is water soluble that should make it stick to objects and not leave a mark.Take a piece of tape and fold it over so that it is double sided and use that. This method may leave a mark depending on the tape. Invest in stickier sticky notes, possibly. Check out LifeHacker. com

How do I stop my earphones from getting tangled
Methods I use with quotes from Lifehacker.comWrap them around your device: Wrap the earbuds or Headphones around a the device. I wrap my earbuds around my MP3 player and that keeps them not tangled. Wrapping them around other object also helps. Thread the through your jacket or shirt: To keep my device warm and my earbuds not tangled I thread my earbuds inside my jacket or shirt and leave my device in my pocket. This way you can hang the actual earbud out of the neck of your jacket. Wrapping the cord with floss or other string: If braiding is your thing, you can braid a friendship bracelet around  your headphones to make them tangle-free using embroidery floss or  even just some regular string.

Even cheap headphones, like these Monoprice 8320s, already  come braided for you. Braided headphones not only look great, but they  prevent any tangles from occurring in the first place. However,  braiding takes a lot of time, so if you want braided headphones and  don't want to take the time to do it yourself, buying braided  headphones is your best bet.Binder Clips: They can be used to hold the Headphones in place or use them in other ways.Just slap on the binder clip near the earpiece end and begin wrapping  the cord around the two metal arms. You can use it as a cable  shortener and even clip it on to your backpack for hassle-free  listening. When you're done, you can take the headphone jack and feed  it through the wider opening of the arms to keep it all in place. This  method is very versatile, but it takes up a lot of space, so you won't  be able to just slide them in and out of your pocket.Additional InfoHuffington Postsnapguide.com: Not the best tutorial, but it helps. Business Insider: Fascinating.Putting them in your pocket with other stuff does not help to maximize their lifespan, it helps them get damaged and dirty. They should be wrapped properly in a separate pocket that does not get that much trauma or damage.

Smell bad but no deodorant
These are some methods I use with references from a site. From mnn:Baking Soda: This works if you apply it to a dry surface. Over time you may have to have to reapply, but it works. Here is a recipe, but I just use plain baking soda:Using baking soda as a deodorant is a  simple way to combat body odor without subjecting your pits to a  variety of chemicals. Mix an eighth of a teaspoon of baking soda with  a little bit of water — don't dissolve it — and rub it under your  arms. You can also create a baking soda and cornstarch mix to fight  odor and help prevent wetness. Simply mix one part baking soda with  six parts cornstarch and dust a little on your underarms.Shaving you underarms: To get rid of the smell, shaving your underarms can work. But in a pinch this tip may be worthless.Using scented antimicrobial soaps: Soaps such as Tea Tree oil and Peppermint can kill the odour causing bacteria and leave you fresh and clean smelling. Lemon Juice: This may burn if you have any open wounds. You can even use non-sugar lemonade as a cleansing solution. The citric acid in lemon juice can kill odor-causing  bacteria, and there are people who swear by the lemon deodorizing  method. Jennifer Palmer, chief executive of an organic skincare line,  told The New York Times that she swipes her armpits with a sliced  lemon on a daily basis. Just be sure not to apply lemon juice to  recently shaven armpits — ouch!Rubbing Alcohol: All these methods I use and they are cheap. The alcohol may burn if applied to fresh shaven arms or wounds. These include hand sanitizers, but make sure the are healthy before applying them to yourself. These really work in a pinch. Rubbing alcohol is another inexpensive and easy deodorant that kills  odor-causing bacteria. Simply fill a spray bottle with alcohol and  spritz your underarms with it. You can even add a few drops of your  favorite essential oil to give it a scent — witch hazel absorbs oil  and is mildly astringent, and tea tree oil can help relieve body odor.Just cleaning really quick works. If you bring some soap you can probably wash up real fast, baby wipes and other cleansing solutions ready work wonders. Making solutions out of essential oils work, but make sure you aren't allergic. Mixing a peppermint or Tea Tree Oil and water solution works, as well.

How to clean eyeglasses if no cleaning cloth or cleaning spray is available?
Lifehacker.comThe AOA recommends washing glasses every morning, paying special  attention to the frames and earpieces, where hair product and makeup  tend to rub off. Whatever you do, don't use the most handy form of  water to clean your lenses. "Some people use spit, but don't," urges  Dr. Geist. Though dirty glasses won't cause an eye infection, saliva  "is not the best hygiene method, and it just won't work very well,"  she says. Soap, warm water and a dry cloth are all you need, once a  day, to keep glasses optimally clean and functional.So taking from that you would have to specify what type of lens you had. Different lens need different treatment:Glass lens: Can be cleaned with mild soap and/ or plain water. To dry air drying or wiping with the cleanest cloth possible is appropriate.Plastic Lens: You probably shouldn't use any soap or rough clothes as these can be very tender. I had plastic lenses and they can be scratched by using harsh clothes and the plastic can be ruined by soaps. Also, dry after a rinse in water with air or with a clean soft cloth. What not to do:Never use newspaper or paper towels. Tissues are more appropriate and babywipes on plastic lenses are a no.the reason your shirt is terrible for cleaning glasses is because it's  likely filled with dust, and that scratches the lenses. Otherwise, any  old piece of cotton will do, and regular old kitchen soap is far  better than those cleaning solutions you get at the optometristSome people say use Hot water and I agree that a hot water scrub with your fingers is a marvellous cleaning solution, but don't use boiling water and make sure your hands aren't greasy or grimy. 
I forgot my toothpaste and it is impossible to buy in this situation, are there any substitutes?
Here is what I use with qoutes from livingthenourishedlife.com:Baking Soda - If mixed with salt it works even better and it is natural and can whiten teeth. like sea salt, you can just dip your toothbrush in baking soda and  brush like normal. Or you can dissolve it in water first and use the  brine for brushing (just like the sea salt). A lot of people use  baking soda as a base for homemade tooth powder. You mix it with a few  drops of peppermint essential oil and stevia to give your mouth a  minty fresh feel.just dab your toothbrush in sea salt and brush away as usual.  Concerned about abrasion? Me, too. You can also dissolve the salt in  water first and then dip your brush in the saltwater before brushing.Hydrogen Peroxide - This is more of a mouth wash, but you can brush with it to. It helps periodontal disease. Hydrogen peroxide is known for keeping teeth clean and white, and many  people use it instead of toothpaste. Jessica on Facebook suggests,  “Dip your toothbrush in hydrogen peroxide and then in a 50/50 mixture  of baking soda and fine sea salt.” The only potential problem with  hydrogen peroxide is if you have amalgam fillings: peroxide may leach  mercury from your fillings.Natural Soaps - Sure these work, but they may have a nasty taste, make sure they are natural.  I use castille. Yes, you can brush your teeth with soap. I’ve tried this one a few  times, and while it does work, it also tastes pretty, well, soapy. Not  exactly the natural toothpaste experience I was looking for  personally. But if you decide to try it, trying a natural soap like  peppermint castile soap.Dry brushing or using just water - These are unfavourable because the nice flavour is not there, but if you floss all bases are covered. Uses teas like peppermint might help, though. doesn't get much more simple than this. Tired of looking for a natural  toothpaste alternative? According to some, there’s no need to use  anything at all: dry brushing does the job. But while it does seem to  work well enough, there’s no minty mouth feel (like we’re all used to,  of course) and might feel a little strange.Oil Pulling - This is when you take oil a move it around in your mouth, in my opinion this is not the best.Basically you swish about one tablespoon of oil (I use coconut oil)  for several minutes. Then brush with plain water or use one of the  methods listed above.Additional InfoGoodHouse Keeping.comYou can use baking soda or both baking soda and salt.

How can I quickly cool coffee to a drinkable temperature?
Methods I use with quotes from WikiHow:Pour the contents from cup to cup. This may take sometimes. Chilling the mug beforehand works wonders. Take your drink and pour it from one cup to the other cup. If your cup  goes higher, then more air will go through it, making it colder. Don't  make your cup go too high, after pouring, it might bounce a few drops  and land on your arms. It will burn!Use Ice cubes. This method works if you drink the beverage fast, otherwise, the Ice Cubes melt and the beverage is watered down, unfavorable.Or you could wrap the ice cubes in foil as it still makes it cold but it won't be watered down quite as muchPut one or two ice cubes in your hot drink.WikiHow, says add 1 or 2, but I usually add more. Also, making milk ice cubes works, because it doesn't water down the drink. Put your Milk, cream, and/or sugar into the refrigerator freezer and pour them into the coffee when you want to drink it. This way the coffee gets tasty and cool. Mixing the sugar and milk together and then freezing it is an amazing hack to save time when preparing coffee because just throw the ice cubes in when you want sugar and milk/cream.Use Ice and Salt. I have never used this method. Put the drink inside its cup into a closed container. Put some ice  sprinkled with salt into the closed container (not into the drink  cup). Let sit briefly. Your drink will be cold in a matter of  minutes.Another MethodTake the coffee and pour it into a saucer and then drink. Pouring amounts into a saucer will cool it down. Cooling a cup of coffee with help of a spoon? But this may take some time. 
My LPG runs out while I am cooking, what should I do now?
Keep an additional LPG in the nearest safe place which you can replace the old one with. I don't think that if you already prepared a spare LPG you'll spend much time to do the replace.Also, should know how much gas left in your cylinder. There is how originlpg.com.au suggest to check how much fuel left in your gas cylinder to avoid running out of it unexpectedly:If you use LPG cylinders, you can check how much gas is left by using the hot water test. Carefully pour hot water down the side of the cylinder and then, after a few moments, run your hand down it. It will feel cool to the touch at the level of the gas. Of course, exercise caution when handling the hot water.
How can I quickly cool coffee to a drinkable temperature?
Pour your drink into a metal/plastic container and place it inside a pot filled with cold water. The material is important because glass, ceramic or porcelain cups will most likely crack due to temperature difference. Stir it with a spoon for a minute and it will cool a lot quicker than if you just left it in there.Advantages of this method:Faster than using a fan: ~1 minute if you stir, ~5 if you leave it;Does not dilute the drink;No additional cleaning up required.
Smell bad but no deodorant
First of all, try a different deodorant or switch to using an antiperspirant. It's important to know the difference between the two. See Wikipedia article for general info.If it still isn't enough, try wiping your armpits with baby wipes or similar cosmetic tissues. If that doesn't work too, maybe find a place to take a shower.If that's not available and you have no other way to do anything about the smell, maybe try not to sweat it so much. After all, if your work involves physically intense labor, your coworkers are likely to understand and not be bothered by the smell. Or you could ask them for advice if you're the only one who smells more than others and you're still concerned.
How do I stop my ears from getting sweaty/greasy while wearing large headphones?
For supra-aural and circum-aural headphones, you can try covering the embouchures with a cotton cloth. Baby wipes and similar products are made of such cloth. This will let your skin breathe somewhat, dramatically reducing the sweaty feeling, and not hindering the sound. If your cloths are too thin, use several, and if it's too thick and starts affecting the sound, just cut out the middle area where the speaker is, where your skin doesn't touch the headphones.
How do I stop my ears from getting sweaty/greasy while wearing large headphones?
Put a couple of tissues on either side, and poke a small hole in the middle, so you don't dampen sound much.That keeps it dry for a long time,  but if they end up getting sweaty eventually, they're super easy to replace. If the set is tight enough, like it should be, you don't have to attach them.This works because tissues are absorptive and breathable. A layer of two is often enough to keep things clean under normal use, but in heavy activity, this won't be a great solution.
How can I quickly cool coffee to a drinkable temperature?
Make coffee ice cubes and keep in the freezer, that way you won't dilute your coffee when putting them in.If you have your coffee in a mug with a sealable lid then shake it, once the cubes are in, for even cooler coffee.Alternative: you could choose to drink ice coffee.Answers on other Stack Exchange sites:http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/5265/cooling-a-cup-of-coffee-with-help-of-a-spoonhttp://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/25510/how-can-i-chill-ice-coffee-quickly
Is there any way to fill in a hole in my shoe - so it is waterproof?
Be prepared and buy a repair product in advance.Mending your lether shoe using duct tape or special glue is a nice idea. There are special repair glues (like Pattex repair gel in Europe) available in your hardware store or building center. Look for the attributes:waterproofflexiblesuitable for your materialsHow to apply? Normally these one component glues require to clean both surfaces and make them rougher. Synthetic fiber material of your jogging shoe is rough by itsself and often also just assembled by glue. Now apply a thin layer on both interfaces. After several minutes, as described on the glue, both interfaces have to be pressed hard together.What if the whole is biggerr and needs extra material? Choose a fabric/leather piece of the same material and proceed to glue like above.Because of the similarity to the actual production process and the propper glue, your mending will last longer. However it will still not look great.
I need to attach two+ pieces of paper without staples, glue, tape, or the like
I have done this with modest success.Place the pieces of paper together as you want them organized with top left corners aligned.fold all of the corners down within a single fold, so that the fold is the "hypotenuse" of a triangle. The length of this side should be about 4-5 cm / 2" or so in length.tear two slits near the center of the fold down through the fold AND the pages, perpendicular to the hypotenuse, about 1 cm / .5" apartfold this new "square" section in the opposite direction of the fold.This is a makeshift solution that should work quite well, so long as repeatted page turning isn't performed too often.Finished Tear-Fold:
How can I dry my hair more quickly?
Is the problem drying the hair faster, or circumventing the water dripping onto your clothes? I simple place a towel over my shoulders to avoid the wet shirt situation, and then dry my hair as needed from there. It doesn't speed up the process of drying, but it eliminates the wet shoulder issue.
How can I dry my hair more quickly?
This may help:Brush your hair out and give it more surface area by brushing. Then dry with a  towel or blow dryer. Tie a towel around your head or shoulders. Also, shake the hair off while you are in the shower. Take your hair and wrap it around the towel and then twist it dry. This might not work for shorter hair that well, but I know it works for long hair. Rubbing your head vigorously with the towel while alternating rubbing sideways and circular movements, this is good for short hair and this also makes the hair appear soft. Putting a dedicated cap on your head will make sure no water gets on you and the hair gets dry.  Also, shower caps are waterproof caps that stop the hair from getting wet. Using several of these tactics at once increases effiency. Good House Keeping:Switch to a ceramic round-barreled brush. It conducts heat and will  warm up under the hot airflow of your dryer, reducing blowout time,  says Sean Jahanbigloo, co-owner of Juan Juan Salon in Los Angeles.  "These brushes usually have fewer bristles than ones made of boar hair  (often used for blowouts), allowing for more airflow." Try Goody Blow  Dry Protect Brush ($9.50, Walmart).Use a better Hair Dryer.Use your hair care Product on your head after doing a brush. And then try drying with the towel or blow dryer.

What's a better way to put clothes in a drawer?
Roll the clothes and then place them vertically. This will help you see  what clothes are what and stay organized.Wrapping rubber bands around the clothes helps them stay folded. You can use CD cases(as dividers) in a rectangular box to make them stay up.And another way to address the extra room problem:Besides this take some books or other "space Fillers" and put them where the clothes used to be as you remove clothing. Taking a box and filling it with clothing items or other items and when you remove enough clothes put those in its place. This keeps clothes standing up straight vertically. Also, laying clothes down flat after the drawer gets empty to a certain amount, may help. Additional InfoWikiHow: Basically how to fold clothes, but this only works if you have clear containers, or other storage options as shown below. Folding T-shirts vertically.: Basically you fold the shirt in half so that it is a long rectangle and then you refold it into square blocks.Fold all of your clothes vertically- Pants can be folded vertically by folding them in half so that the legs are touching and then folding into blocks accordingly. 53 Seriously Life-Changing Clothing Organization TipsAdjustable drawer organizers keep your clothes in line.  A alternative to this is taking a rectangular container and putting dividers in it, these can be CD cases or other items you find helpful.For super-neat folded clothes or towels, install wooden shelf  dividers.  These can be made yourself or you can use a book or book end(these work better). Take containers and put them on edge.

How can I dry my hair more quickly?
I have quite long hair and this is what works for me 847% as minimum:Before you do any drying operations with your hair, wipe your head with some towel (personally I don't like it when water is dripping from my hair),  lower your head so that all the hair is drooping down:maybe its not really beautiful, but my freehand!Then, if you have (I hope you do) a circular comb, like thissourceReel your hair up with it while fanning it, starting from the roots. If you don't have such a comb, use the usual one, but the circular is more effective.Also, if there is someone with me and I am using public fans and there are almost no people, I ask that someone to use another fan (while I am using the first) :)

Cleaning a dirty computer screen
I find that old glasses cleaning cloths work well. If you wear glasses, you probably have a few of those (if you don't you should save them; they're useful). This is probably very similar to a microfiber cloth. I figured that since they're designed to clean glasses without scratching them, they can clean computer screens without scratching them.These are the steps I follow:Make sure the computer is off 1Check for dust on the screen. If there is, blow as much off as you can 2.Wipe the screen gently, avoiding circular motions 3. At particularly dirty spots, breathe on the screen to get it slightly foggy 2, then wipe over that.1: Might not be necessary, but on a touchscreen, this avoids the random screen-presses. Also, it might possibly reduce the risk of electrocution (which I presume is a pretty small risk, however)2: I do this with my glasses all the time, so I basically copy the process with my computer screen3: I've encountered a couple places which recommend avoiding circular motions. You shouldn't be buffing your screen, but gently wiping it. How-To Geek
How to put a slipped bike chain back on the freewheel without getting dirty?
Not sure what indexed shifters are, but assuming it was your front gear (the one with the pedals), here's a method that works for me:While riding, as soon as you realize the chain came off, stop pedaling.Stop riding and dismount.Shift the gears of the bike all the way opposite of the side the chain fell off. So if the chain fell to the right, you want the derailleur all the way to the left, and vice versaLift the back wheel of the bike off the ground. Some bikes have a kickstand in a location that allows the bike to be leaned rather than lifted, which is easier.Start pedaling the bike with your hands.The chain should go back onto the gears on its own, but it might slip a few times.Naturally, if it feels wrong or the chain feels like its under a lot of stress, stop. It's better to get your hands dirty than to break a chain.
What can be used in place of a mousepad?
I find that a folder (with contents in it, otherwise it moves) works well, especially since I almost always have one with me. Plus because it's bigger than a mousepad, I prefer it to a mousepad. Keep in mind that there are many different types of folders, and some don't work well.Binders: no. Binders are slantyShiny folders: these don't seem to work well. They appear to be laminatedPlastic folders: no. These don't work well at allCardboardy/paper folders: these work the best, but some are better than others.The best folder I've found has a texture:I'm guessing that this reduces the contact surface with the mouse, making it really easy to move. Every smooth folder I've tried makes the mouse harder to move. Actually, come to think of it, this might make the mouse easier to move than a mousepad; it's been a while since I've actually used a mousepad so I can't compare.
How to reform dent on hair due to long usage of head-phones?
My solutions: Wear a hat or loosen the band to the headphones. Wear the headphones with the rest around your neck, i.e. wear them the wrong way.Thread your hair on top of the head rest portion. Don't have your hair under the headrest/earmuff portion.Wetting your hair with a spray bottle of water that you carry with you or going to a sink to wet it can remove the dent. Solutions that may be helpful from loevelyish.com:Put your hair in curls. IDK about this, it may not be your thing.Wear a headband or other similar device.I always say, if you're scared of damaging your style, just pre-damage  it on your own terms so you're immune to the evil ways of the headset.  Clear your hair away from your ears before you put the phones on so  there isn't any hair getting creased in between, and brace the top of  the headset on top of your cutie pie headband and voila! OR you can  just use the headband when you're headed out for happy hour. Put it in  the spot where the headset was and it looks like your hair meant for  it to be there. Just make sure (for comfort's sake, too) to go for a  nice wide one similar to the width of your headset.Bring some styling products with you. This might be hairspray, etc.Maybe just one, even. The grocery store loves to accommodate with  little tiny versions of all your favorites (as do salons), and for you  it might just be a matter of a little hairspray or a little paste to  fluff your style back up and kill the crease. You might use the  products to just rearrange your hairstyle before drinks or just smooth  it back into a ponytail, but it's all about being prepared.Headset Hair: Correction/Prevention?

Or as RayOfLight says:i wear my hoodie on my head first, then i have the headphone over my headMaybe Different ways to wear Headphones:Head-fi.org:Another way you could cope with this is by buying crappy headphones  that go around the back of your head rather than on top. But these  tend to hurt after a while, and SQ probably won't be comparable to  anything we discuss here. You could also just try using earbuds or  IEM's that deliver good SQ.The most forgiving full sized headphone I can imagine will probably be  the Audio Technica line-up of headphones. They're all pretty light  weight, and they've got that wing design that allows the headphones to  just rest on your head rather than gripping it tightly all around.  However, if the wings do squish down on your hair, then you're just  going to end up with an even funnier look than a normal set since  you'll have the sides flattened down, and a portion in the middle  still sticking up.Also, washing your hair more than once a day (many say more than once  every other day) with shampoo/conditioner is known for making hair  oily and problematic in general.
What can be used in place of a mousepad?
I find that regular printer paper gives a better surface for mice than a table, and I use that all the time. I use 9x13" 20lb. letter/printer paper. So far the only issue is that when the table is slippery enough, the paper may get pushed around by the mouse or your hand.  You can get around this by stacking up several papers. The more, the better, to a degree, stability-wise. You can also lick your finger, and wipe it on the bottom of the paper(s), to prevent it sliding, or set one edge under the laptop.
How can I organize my chest freezer?

My LPG runs out while I am cooking, what should I do now?
Depending on the food, you could try a Flambé, basically give the food a healthy splash of alcohol and set it on fire to cook the food the rest of the way.If the food your cooking wouldn't taste right drenched in alcohol you can still use high proof alcohol as a fuel to cook the food.Simply pour a couple of ounces in the bottom of a heavy pot and light it, you can then hold your other pan over the naked flame. Be careful though alcohol tends to burn with a nearly invisible blueish flame, so it may be lit without looking like it is.
How can I soften hard soil enough to insert short plastic stakes?
I've heard that in the "The Good Old Days" people would build fires on top of a patch of earth in order to dig graves in the winter. I'm guessing that a small scale version of this may do the trick.Take a coffee can and cut both sides out.Then stab some ventilation holes around the can.Place the can on the frozen ground where you want to put your lamp.Build a small fire in the can and let it burn for a few hours.Smother the fire.The ground should now be warm enough to dig a small hole and you have a little ash to add to your compost as a side benefit.Apparently modern grave diggers use specially designed water proof heating blankets for this purpose, so a small house hold heating pad may do the trick as well.
How can I quickly cool coffee to a drinkable temperature?
The other answers so far mostly suggest cooling your coffee by putting it in contact with cold things. This is a bad idea because itDoesn't increase the rate of cooling a lot initially (approximately by a factor of 2 to 3)Does increase the rate of cooling a lot once the coffee is already near room temperature relative to normal cooling, at which point you risk over-cooling your coffeeIce cubes will dilute coffeeInstead, I suggest cooling your coffee in a different way. The rate of cooling is proportional to the surface area of the liquid, so increase the surface area of your coffee. Take your coffee, and poor it into a large pan or container. The container should be as long and wide as possible. This increases surface area. This Pyrex 4-quart baking dish is a pretty good option, and is useful for other lifehacks like the "storing a leftover casserole in your refrigerator" hack (also requires plastic wrap). A bowl is not a good option as the rounded bottom has low surface area. Then wait for it to cool. You can put this near the fan if you want to, which will improve air flow and help mix the coffee, but it isn't strictly necessary.If that doesn't cool fast enough (as could be a problem if you have to cool a whole pot of coffee and can only afford a small baking dish), take any clean metal silverware you have available and put it in the container prior to pouring the coffee. Ideally you want to have the silverware submerged as much as possible, but still have a small part outside the coffee so that it will stay in contact with the air as well and thus transfer head to the air. For forks and spoons, place them so that the large ends are in the coffee. This does two things. For one, it increases the surface area of the coffee, which is good. But it's doubly effective because metals are also good conductors of heat, and will evacuate the heat from your coffee faster than just air alone.If that's still not fast enough, in addition, you can take an electric mixer and turn it on at high speed in the coffee. You can also mix with a spoon or whisk, but that's not as effective. The mixer will get air bubbles into the coffee. Don't worry, they won't stay for long, but that increases the surface area further. It also causes circulation, which will lead to a higher rate of evaporative cooling.Once  you finish with that, pour your coffee back into your mug (through a colander to sort out the silverware) and drink. Note that in a pinch, you can combine this method with most of the ice and/or refrigeration methods, but this is not recommended unless your coffee is very hot and you need to drink it very quickly.
My pants are falling off!
Here's a neat trick that's actually been around for thousands of years. All you need is a bit of rope (enough to wrap around your waist plus a bit extra). Seriously, don't underestimate what you can do with rope.Pull your pants up a bit above where you'd normally wear them. Take the rope and wrap it around your waist, a few inches below the top of your pants waistline. Tie it off with a knot tight enough that. A square knot will do if you are in a rush, but a bowline is surely the best option as it won't slip and can be pulled tight. If you've done it well, you'll find that your pants don't fall off. If not, you probably need to tie the rope a bit tighter.If you have pants which are especially long, you can pull them up more than above. Then fold  the tops over the rope. If you fold one complete revolution all the way around the rope, you'll make a toroidal loop which surrounds the rope. That will be relatively stable due to friction between the two fabric surfaces. You'll find this approach is especially effective for extra-large pants when you have some that are too big to fit you normally.In fact, this lifehack is so useful, people started designing special ropes just for it. Some of them aren't actually made of rope, and many use different fastening mechanisms and somewhat different shapes. The end result is the same though. People often refer to these special ropes as "belts". You'll also find pants which are made with special loops of fabric. These "belt loops" do the trick above for you; just stick the rope in the loop, and it can't slip out unless the fabric rips. Sometimes pants come with elastic ropes built in to them; I've found these often snap or fall inside the pants in such a way that they are inaccessible; in that case, so long as you have more rope, it's no problem (just follow the steps above).
I forgot my toothpaste and it is impossible to buy in this situation, are there any substitutes?
Your body was already built with this hack! The ancient Romans used their own urine for both toothpaste and mouthwash. While this might sound like a bad idea, urine is high in ammonia, which fights cavities. Your body doesn't have any use for this, so it gets rid of it through your urine. But your teeth absolutely love it (almost as much as fluoride) and it does a good job dealing with some nasty microorganisms.It is a common belief that urine is also hygienic and sterile. So long as you don't have any ureal conditions, human urine is sterile when it exits your body. It does quickly become unsterile though. So you should use it as soon as possible, since many bacteria outside your body like to inhabit your urine.According to other new researches (Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Frontiers) urine is not sterile, but sometimes there may be healthy or unhealthy mixture of bacteria.Definitely don't swallow your urine; this will probably do nothing in the near term but if you do it repeatedly it can cause all sorts of bad things to happen with your kidneys.Note that this will make your breath smell a bit. If you're going to do this around other people, you may want to pop a breath mint or at least gargle some water afterwards. The Romans had different cultural views on the scent of urine, and so that wasn't an issue for them.
How can you get your car as cool as possible on a hot summer day without air conditioning?
Try hacking your car with some white paint! White objects reflect light, while black and other colors tend to absorb most of the light. During the summer, when the sun is out, your car can heat up a lot. The more light it absorbs, the more energy (and consequently heat) is contained in the car. This can make it rather unpleasant to be in dark car. White cars will generally stay cooler than other kinds.If you're just now buying a car, consider buying one pre-hacked. Most car companies will sell you a white or light-colored car. If you can't do this, most automotive maintenance shops will repaint your car. You can do it yourself if you know what you're doing, but keep in mind that water based or latex paints aren't recommended on metal surfaces; the easiest way to paint your own car is with specialized auto paint or spray paint.Dark colored car fans might despair, since this can't be used in conjunction with the "Dirt and other marks are basically invisible on a black car" hack. But there is an option which preserves the best of both worlds. If you really can't part with your dark-colored car, consider investing in a light-colored tarp and sticking it in your trunk during summer months. The tarp should be large enough to cover the car completely. When you need to park in a spot that isn't completely covered, put the tarp over your car. You may see even better results with this "white tarp" method than with the "white paint" hack, but the tarp will take some effort to find and may cost on the order of 10-20 USD. Also note that there are some specially made "car covers" which are just tarps designed specifically for this purpose, so you might want to look into that, though they might cost a bit more than the equivalent-sized tarp would.
I'm in the rain without an umbrella, how can I get home quickly without getting too wet?
Modern technology lets you hack this problem away! In most parts of the world, weather forecasting is performed at least daily, and in many places you can get accurate hour-by-hour predictions. One of the main things they try to predict is whether there will be precipitation. As you can see from this study, the best predictors as of 7 years ago were bordering on 90% accuracy one day off, and it's only gotten better since. You can check forecasts on any device with an internet connection, such as a computer or a smartphone. You can also check them via TV or radio if those are more readily available.That means that 90% of the time, you can avoid this trouble by checking the weather forecasts, which should not take more than a few seconds in the morning. If there's anything more than a 10% chance of rain, just bring an umbrella and you've pre-hacked the system to avoid your troubles. You can do better by checking closer to the time you need to be outside, since forecasts generally do better the closer you are.In addition, if you frequently go to certain places other than your home (e.g. your office) you can leave an umbrella in each of them. This will allow you to check right before you have to go outside again, which gives you the benefit of the most up-to-date forecasts. The only downside is that you'll have to carry the umbrella back with you, but that's not anywhere near as bad as being caught in the rain without one.As an alternative to an umbrella, you could keep a poncho in your pocket. Disposable ponchos are available for as low as 1 USD and easily fit in even a small pocket. A garbage bag with a hole for your head will work as well if you're desperate. These are good options if umbrellas are not acceptable for any reason.
What can be used in place of a mousepad?
You can use a small piece of floor carpet that isn't too thick. It may not be very comfortable, but that totally depends on the material and texture of the carpet. You can even find those which you might like more than the store-bought mouse pads.Also it is important to check your mouse sensor type. I have a portable usb mouse that is specifically labeled as "for shiny surfaces". It works just fine on glass, table tops and other shiny surfaces, just as it says it would, but surprisingly, it lags and does weird stuff on common mouse pads. Maybe get one of those and forget about carpets and mouse pads.If you don't care about your table and you don't want to buy a mouse, find a way to make the table surface non-shiny. For example, you could rub some sand paper on the area you're moving the mouse around. The trick is that optic sensor built into the mouse may not focus very well on shiny surfaces because of its flat texture. To help it with the focus, you may increase the surface texture variations by sanding it a bit.Or as others recommended, just put a standard office sheet of paper under it. Its texture is already good enough for most mice to work fine. But your palm might feel sore after some time because the paper will dry it out and result in additional friction with paper. To counter that, you could wear a glove.
How to eat chips with out getting hands dirty
Assuming you don't mind getting your thumb and forefinger dirty, you could do push the bottom of the chip bag up so that you can reach the chips without submerging your hand in the bag, which would get your knuckles all dirty. For detailed instructions, I like this video by Crazy Russian HackerHowever, if you don't want to get your hands dirty at all, there is only one way I've found. It doesn't work with all kinds of chips, just the ones that stick to your tongue or that you can grasp with your tongue:Pour some amount of chips into a bowl. This can be done without touching the chips at all.Hold the bowl with one handMove the bowl upwards towards your mouthStick your tongue out towards the chips, letting it touch oneIf the chip sticks to your tongue, great. Cheetos do that well. So does popcorn. If the chip doesn't stick to your tongue, attempt to grasp the chip with your tongue (probably requires a flexible tongue)Pull your tongue back into your mouth.The chip should now be in your mouth and you can eat properly.Note: when there are few chips left in your bowl, it starts to get awkward because you have to bury your face in the bowl and stick your tongue out really far. But hey, if we want clean hands...

What is a good makeshift bookend?
Low Energy Methods:Take a vase or large jar and fill it with marbles or coins. This is decorative and cheap.Take a clear container and add some of your favourite or needed stuff, make sure they are heavy. Like watches, wallets, etc.Make a stack of books. Simply take a stack of books and place them at the end of the shelf. Also potted plants work to or taking a garden stone and using that. Using a winter(or other) Boot or bottles also help. Creating a food can pyramid works, as well. But make sure the cans are not empty.Some methods from below may meet your needs without being exhausting. My thoughts with pics from 21 Simple Ideas for DIY Bookends:Use a pillow. The pillow should be kind of big and heavy.Use small statues. Try something heavy also dumbbells help if you have a heavy duty shelf. Things like vases and potted plants(may lead to bugs) are helpful. If you can screw the head off the weight that really helps. Concrete bookends. These can be created from pouring concrete into a plastic mold and setting it for 5-7 days, then curing it. I like to let my concrete set for nearly a month, but I usually use large amounts. Stick rocks together. You will need hot glue or another strong glue and stick all the rocks together. Using gravel and lots of glue really works. Covering bricks or just painting books. If you have a old book or a useless book(like Twilight) just paint that, you may need a heavier book or need 2 or 3 together. Also, take a brick and paint it(I do this) or cover it in cloth that matches the decor. Uses vases with flowers or landscapes. Here is some pretty landscape or terrarium bookend that someone made:If you are crafty the sky is the limit.

How to avoid splatters when microwaving?
Cover the food with paper! First, some safety stuff (or you can skip this and just use wax paper, which is safe):Be warned that there might be some safety hazard. I have used this my entire life without any problems, but that doesn't mean that problems won't crop up.Make sure you don't have metal in the microwave. You don't want sparks to set fire to your paper.Paper burns at 451 degrees Fahrenheit. Food in a microwave rarely gets above 212 degrees. So the paper should not catch fire"Most paper plates, towels, napkins and bags [are microwave safe]. For optimal safety, use white, unprinted materials." ref So unprinted printer paper would likely be okay. However, note that "brown paper bags and newspapers" same ref are not microwave safe.More things supporting microwave safe:This guy did an experimentMore safety to keep into account:This says the chemicals from paper can transfer to your food.I didn't find much that specifically talked about printer paper, but you might want to play it safe. Printer ink isn't too good to ingest, but if you don't care about that, you can use old printed paper. If you do care, you could use one-sided printed paper. Or you could just use paper.If you want more safety, wax paper is completely safe, as can be seen from various references.Now that safety is out of the way:For something like a bowl, just lay the paper directly on top if it's not going to touch your food anyways. If your microwave has a tray that rotates, you might have to fold the ends down so that the paper doesn't get pushed off.For something like a plate, fold the ends down to give the paper some elevation, and fold the center of the paper so it doesn't touch your food much. If you do mind the paper touching your food, you might have to add some supporting folds the other direction. Something like this:

Cover the container with food with a piece of baking paper aka parchment paper. This will be fire-safe and keep the boiling droplets from flying out of the container. Parchment paper can withstand temperatures above 500 °C long enough for you to bake a turkey or several in a gas oven. Microwaves shouldn't be a problem.But don't mix it up with waxed paper or else it will burn!
I'm in the rain without an umbrella, how can I get home quickly without getting too wet?
This answer cannot account for your transportation. If you ride cabs, drive yourself or use the bus, I cannot account for that. Because these factors differ everywhere My methods:Carry a reasonably water proof bag with you. If you have a purse or other handbag you can use that to cover your head at least and deflect some of the water from your body.Carry a garbage bag. A large garbage bag can be used to cover your clothes and stop them from getting you very wet, also they are small so you can carry them anywhere. Alternatively, even though this is not a hack you could use some waterproof smocks(sort of like this, but there are smaller ones).Smaller storage bags that you may have if you are coming from the store or can pick up somewhere can be applied to your limbs with rubberbands(or just tied using the bag) to keep them dry. Or you can put your clothes in the bag.Newspaper or magazine. Holding these over your head makes them get wet and not you. Try taking your clothing off. This is very undesirable, but you can undress as much clothing as is decent and put them in any bag you have. Or take a shirt you have off(if you can) and drape that to protect the other clothing.Or in the words of Lifehacker.com: Run for it.you will catch less rain if you run faster, but the angle of your body  has an effect as well because of the direction of the rain. Leaning  forward can improve your chances of staying dry. This is great, but my  concern would be more of slipping and falling or running into  something accidentally than getting wet in this case.So try to:Angle away from the rainNot slipRun very fastAdditional InfoCreate a Homemade umbrellaPlan ahead:  Bring a umbrella or check the weather.

How can I light the very back of my fire?
Assuming you're lighting something like paper or another easily burned material under the wood, you can try lighting rolled up newspaper or some similar material. Use one or two pages at a time, rolling them diagonally so that it reaches further than rolling it horizontally or vertically would. Keep the roll relatively tight so that there's not a big hole and make sure to light the bottom of the roll so that the top catches fire as well. Smaller pieces of paper work as well, but the longer the roll the more time you'll have to light the material for the fire.As for the convoluted method you mentioned, magnifying glasses focus light not heat, so that wouldn't work :)

Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
Do you have a fan? It would be a wonderful tool to kill them. As you know, fans blows with their front side, but the rear side will suck and (hopefully) cut the fly in pieces. Fly is quite a small thing, so I doubt that it will make and damage to your fan.Also, any kind of sticks with motorized propellers, they'll also work.This would be an example of such stick, but its quite simple to make one with lego :)sourceAnd mini-vacuum cleaners would work too (e.g. for automobiles). Of course, normal-sized vacuums would work too, but I don't think its easy to chase a fly with big ones.Another way (maybe not as efficient) - try to fill some of your spray bottles with water. Then spray some water on a fly (do not recommend to do it near some technic :D ).

Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
The trick of how to kill flies is the approach rather than the item used. Flies have nearly 360 degree vision, so sneaking won't help.First, wait for them to land somewhere that you can strike against. Waving them towards an area can help, but isn't fully effective. Once it is landed on an acceptable area, approach the fly slowly, not making any sudden movements. Most of the time the fly will not move unless you get very close. Continue until you're within striking distance.Once you're within striking distance, continue to move your arm that is going to strike the fly closer to the fly until the item you're striking it with is approximately 7-10 inches (18-25 centimeters) away from the fly. You'll get the feel of it after a few failed attempts where it flies away most likely. Then comes the big moment: strike at it as fast as you can. Usually the fly does not have time to react fast enough to escape the blow, especially if the object you're striking with has some width.I've killed dozens if not hundreds of flies this way using my hand, rolled up paper, a shoe, or something similar.
How do I avoid the crumbs at the bottom of the cereal box?
If you don't want to buy a colander or have one sitting around, you can make your own quite easily!The easiest way to make one would be to use the plastic bag that the cereal comes in. Simply punch a few small holes into the bottom of the bag (since it's the last part of the cereal the bag's condition doesn't matter) with a sharp object, a pen would work. I wouldn't recommend cutting holes in the bag because it'd be easy to make them too big to where the cereal is likely to slide out. However, while this is the most simple approach, it's likely not the most effective due to the flimsiness of the bag.As such, it'd be better to use something a little more sturdy. If you wanted to make a serious colander, you could use a plastic bowl (preferably a thin one) and drill holes (or perhaps saw if you have the correct tools) into it but that's a good bit of work. A much easier way would be to use a tin pan or something similar - it'd work great. Since it's more sturdy, you could cut or punch holes into it, which allows larger escapes for the crumbs while making them a size to keep the cereal in.In any case, put the cereal in the colander you made and shake it around, particularly back and forth, trying to get the crumbs to go in the holes you made.
How to keep chewing gum's flavor?
Dip it in some menthol crystals. Use sparingly; they're very strong.Alternately, just pop a strong mint hardcandy in your mouth and chew it up along with your gum. The fragments will mix with the gum and keep it minty for a little while longer.Or just stop chewing gum. It's designed to be disposable; if you're expecting it to last, you're doing it wrong. Consider investing in some good flavored toothpicks, which both last longer and help you remove bits of food stuck in your teeth.
How to keep chewing gum's flavor?
A Solution:Take a mint or some other candy. Take these and suck on them at the same time you suck on chew the gum and the flavour should come back. Also, take the candy and smash it into pieces and introduce that into your mouth or cover the gum with it.Adding a drop of some flavoured syrup also helps. Or even chewing on mint leaves, but do this on a different side of your mouth. Otherwise your gum will be ruined. Chewing the gum slower helps keep its flavour more, as the saliva that is breaking down the flavour cannot circulate through out the gum as fast. By chewing you are kneading the saliva into the gum.And there is no way to stop it, it appears. wonderopolis.orgSo why don’t these flavors last? When you chew gum, the saliva (spit)  in your mouth begins to digest the sweeteners and flavorings in the  gum. Unlike the gum base, the other ingredients can be broken down and  digested.As you swallow while you chew, the digested sweeteners and flavorings  move through your digestive system to your stomach. Eventually, you  digest all the sweeteners and flavorings, and all you’re left with is  the gum base and softeners. That’s when you sense that your gum has  lost its flavor.And something I haven't tried.Barry -   Yes. So Martha’s been chewing some minty chewing gum and I  hope by now the mintiness has disappeared.Martha -   Yes and it’s going a bit cardboardy and generally not very  nice.Barry -   OK. So now what I’m going to do is I’m going to ask you to  take it out of your mouth and roll it in this little mound of icing  sugar that I’ve got in front of you and if you just pop that back and  have a chew on it.Martha -   Urgh, choking on some icing sugar.Barry -   Tell me how it tastes now. Just keep chewing away for a  moment or two. So what we’re really investigating is the way that one  sense has an impact on another. So, here we’re talking about how taste  might affect smell.Martha -    Mmm…Yeah, so it’s definitely tasting newer again and yeah,  the mintiness is coming back.Barry -   So the mintiness has come back and that’s amazing because  there is no mint in icing suger. So that’s a strange effect. What  you’re getting is the fact that when you combine the sugar with the  odour in your mouth, you get something super-additive that’s more than  the sum of the parts. You’re not getting them both together, you’re  getting the sugar boosting your ability to detect mint and the mint  seems to resume its presence.So apparently rolling the gum in sugar may help.

What's the best way to keep your shirt tucked in?
Longer torso length shirts would be my first choice (and recommended by other people for this question).Double sided tape would be my second choice. There are lots of products out there specifically made for this (i.e., Hollywood Fashion Tape, double sided stylist tape, etc.). You could even use duct tape in an emergency (not recommended as the glue doesn't come off clothing easily).If you need to make temporary (emergency) double sided tape, you have some options:Make small loops of regular tape with the glue facing out. This method may require lots of loops to prevent the clothing from slipping.Make a long loop of regular tape with the glue facing out. At some interval, place a holding loop around the longer loop to prevent it from sliding apart. You could think of this assembly like cable ties around cables.Using two pieces of tape that are approximately the same length, put the glue sides together where about half of the glue is not covered by the other piece of tape.
What's the best way to keep your shirt tucked in?
Just tuck your shirt into your underwear really well and then pull your trousers on over the top. Stretch your arms up to loosen it a little so it doesn't look too tight and to prevent the possibility of a wedgie. This works for me.

A hard book can smack houseflies with accuracy as they don't move very much, but make sure you don't use to heavy of a book. Also, a wet rag can be used, as it has the appropriate weight. You could experiment and some people say use plastic platulas, but I've never really tried. Make fly traps. Take a water bottle and cut it half. Take the top funnel portion and put it into the bottom. You can keep the bottle top on but I don't. Putting a sugar and vinegar solution also helps, but you can use fruit juices or pop(about 5 table spoons) as these work better. You can take a jar and place a paper funnel into it. Also, add a solution as stated above. Both these methods may use sugary solutions which attract the flies, the funnels stop the from escaping.

What is a good makeshift coin holder or organizer?
A craft idea I have is to cut 4 or so old socks, probably right around the ankle part. Then take some string or rope, and cut some small holes in the socks for the string to pass through. Slide the string through the socks, then take another string and tie/adhere the ends together. With the other string, just adhere it to the wall with a nail or something. Thus I can have a nice organizational coin holders. Another idea without worrying about organizing the denominations is I could just take an empty gallon water jug, cut it around the middle, and then just use the bottom part as a coin holder. 
How can you get your car as cool as possible on a hot summer day without air conditioning?
If you have a converter, there's really no need to work around not having an air conditioner in your car, as long as you can run a fan you can make your own air conditioner.Basically what you want to do is take two different-sized containers (one has to fit inside the other). In the larger container you want to cut out a hole in the top so that you can set the fan on it and have air blowing into the container., and a few small holes in the side so that air can escape.Then, you take the smaller container, and fill it with ice. Simply place the container with ice into the larger container, then set the fan on top and turn it on. The fan will blow air over the ice which cools it, and the air will escape out the sides of the container. source
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
The reason that flyswatters are more effective than a magazine is because of the holes. Moving a newspaper, magazine or other flat object through the air very quickly actually creates a buffer of air moving in front of the object you're swiping with, which blows the fly out of the way. As well as avoiding the above, a flyswatter's holes enable it to move faster, thus increasing the chance of whacking the fly.So, if you want to improvise a flyswat, I would recommend using any device that has holes in big enough for air to pass through but not big enough for a fly to pass through.I would also recommend getting your arm as close as possible (moving slowly) before swatting. This gives the fly less time to react to your movement and decreases the chances of escape.Finally, for a less active approach, you can try killing flies without swatting them. A jam jar half-full of sugar water with some holes cut in the lid always worked quite nicely for me, or there are numerous commercial products that attract and trap flies - for example, on sticky paper.
How to avoid splatters when microwaving?
Use cling film (plastic wrap) and make small holes close to the centre of the dish. I find that this is enough to let steam escape, and any splatter effect is reduced (compared to covering the dish with something and leaving a small gap at the edge) because the holes are central and small.
How can I light the very back of my fire?
I'm assuming you're building your fires in the more "traditional" way, something like this:This method has a few drawbacks... I'm guessing that you're looking to light your fire from the front and back in the hopes of getting it to burn evenly to prevent it from collapsing in on itself and smothering right? Rather than changing the way you light the fire, consider changing the way you build it to begin with. There are a couple of fire building methods that should light easily without requiring you to light it from the back. Try the Top Down Fire:In this arrangement you should be able to light the paper at the top-front and the flame should quickly spread all the way back and then slowly burn downward. The whole stack should light in about ten minutes.Try the Box Fire or Log Cabin Fire: In this arrangement you light the paper at the bottom-front and the flame should spread down the middle to the back pretty quickly. Both of these methods should give you a nice fire without too much babysitting. Adding more wood to these fires will also be easier because you're working with a flat top, so there's no need to carefully place and balance new logs.

What to do if your shaver broke halfway through shaving?
My last answer was removed; apparently folks thought I was joking. So I'll drop the levity...If you don't want to look like a "freak" (your word), then you want to be very careful about what you use to remove hair from your face. The skin on your face is extremely sensitive; while you can easily use many different tools and techniques to remove hair from other parts of your body, careless treatment of your face is nearly certain to result in damage to your skin that will look (and feel!) worse than the hair you started with. In particular, if you are prone to ingrown hairs you'll want to avoid cutting or breaking the hair at or below the skin.In short, I'm saying you should avoid hacky solutions here. No matter how negatively you expect folks to react to you showing up with a day's growth of facial hair, showing up looking like you stepped out of the burn unit into a nest of wasps isn't going to be an improvement. That said... You can certainly mitigate the impact of shaver breakage. Here are a couple of suggestions:Top-down + bottom-up shavingLike most of us, you probably shave by starting on one side of your face and then moving to the other, to allow you to clearly see what you're doing in a mirror by turning your head.Well, stop doing that. Start at the top and work in narrow rows across your entire face down to your jaw line, being careful to still shave with the grain. Then start at the bottom of your neck and shave in rows up to your jaw line, again being careful to respect the grain. Finish your jaw line, and do a final pass perpendicular to the grain to catch stray hairs that may have been flattened during the first pass. At no time during this process do you look like Two-Face. The worst that can happen is that you're left with a slightly odd-shaped band of stubble - and there's a way to mitigate that too...Two-pass shavingInvest in a small, inexpensive electric clipper. These are essentially a miniature version of the ones your barber uses to trim your hair, and you can probably pick these up for $10-$12 at your local discount department store. You can even find packages that come with fairly crappy electric shaver heads as well, which has the added bonus of giving you a spare shaver and potentially side-stepping this whole issue.Once you have your trimmers, use those to do a first pass on your face. Don't use a guard - just hold the flat head of the trimmer parallel to your skin, allowing the hair to enter the cutting blades without bringing the cutting surfaces themselves into contact with your skin. Note that the design of this tool is essentially a row of tiny scissors - which should thus comply with your religious obligations. Once you're done, you'll be left with fairly short stubble. If your shaver breaks immediately, you could just go with that look - it's actually quite popular these days. Assuming you want a closer shave, just finish it up with your normal shaver, using the top-down/bottom-up method described above. The advantages of this method are threefold:The shorter hair will actually be easier for most electric shavers to handle without getting clogged, thus making it less likely that your shaver will break mid-way. There's less of a difference in hair length between the area you're shaving and the area you've already shaved - so if your shaver does break mid-way, you're not going to look as odd. As the trimmers can readily handle hair of any length, you should need fewer passes to complete the job - thus reducing skin irritation. 
How to make neat, round pancakes
I have a lot of old 60ml syringes lying around. These make great water guns, but you can also use them to make pancakes. Just be sure you either get all the lumps out of the batter, or cut part of the end off so it can handle some lumps.Simply stick the end into the batter, pull the desired amount into the syringe, and push it into the pan.This is great because:You can make them any shape you wantYou have measurements on the sides, you can make them all the same size if you wantIt's not messy at all, hardly any cleanup needed, and it doesn't dripYou don't end up with a lot of batter stuck to the edges, like you do with a squeeze bottleAnd others.

More effective way to clean a CD/DVD?
This doesn't sound like a clean disk issue.But, I digress.First off, compact disks are made primarily out of plastic.  Thus, proper liquids should be used. (Water in this case)Rinse the surface of the disk with water. If the disk is greasy/etc, use water and a tiny bit of soap.Shake the disk to dry off some of the water.Dry the disk using a microfiber cloth. However, dry it by starting from the middle and swiping out. Repeat until completely dry.
How can I fit more dishes in my microwave at once?
You can use a microwave safe mug or cup to elevate one of the bowls or plates.Image from PinterestThis works much better with bowls because plates will slip and slide more.
How can I fit more dishes in my microwave at once?
Any of these will work:Disable the turntable (when it's on, you're essentially cropping the rectangular footprint into a smaller, circular one)Elevate one item with a microwave-safe mug, making sure the bowl/plate is well-supportedAlso note that microwaving multiple items at once saves no time (You have to approximately double cooking time for two), and increases the chance of cold spots.
Homemade dehydrator without using the oven
Methods I use:Use the sun. In the summer this is a popular method and can even be done indoors, try to avoid humidity, though. From realfoodswitch.com:If you live in a warm climate or happen to have a very big sunny  window you could sun dry your dehydrator recipes. Keep in mind that  the sun may get hotter than the 112-120F degrees that is recommended  for eating raw. However, if the option is to eat something deep fried  or something sun dried I think the best option is pretty clear!One thing to watch out for using this technique is that animals and  bugs may decide to have a bite or run off with some of your food.Covering foods with nets, muslin or other light cloth works and watching them for being finished really helps. Use a toaster oven. If you already have one of those mini-toaster ovens then this is for  you. If you’re planning on buying one for this – then just get an  affordable dehydrator instead.This is how you should go about dehydrating raw foods in your toaster  oven: place the foods you want to dehydrate on a plate or sheet in the  oven. Set the toaster oven on the lowest possible setting, and prop  the door open. At this point you may also want to put a fan in front  of the oven so there is no water condensation taking place. This  speeds up the dehydrating process and also makes sure your food won’t  get soggy.From tacticalintelligence.netUse a fire. Grills, fireplaces, etc. Hang the food(placing to the side of the fire on a tray works to) about 6 inches or less above the fire, you should not use artificial woods as your food will then taste like them. This method is best used for drying meats. Basically you’ll want to  hang strips of meat on a rack and place these in front of a fire.  Vegetables and fruits can be placed on the ground near the fire,  however be sure that you are protecting the food from nearby critters.Use the wind. This is the least favourable method as it takes longer and the food will have greater risk of spoilage. Meat should not be used by this method unless you use assistive devices(hair dyers, fans, etc) or have no other method. Form a bag out of some netting (or use an existing netted bag) and  place the food inside it. This is then hung from a clothes line or  tree branch outside. This method also works inside the house in front  of a fan.Using preservatives or treatments(lemon juice, etc) before drying helps prevent spoilage. Fire is usually the fastest method. Additional InfoFor meat:[The USDA’s] current recommendation for making jerky safely is to heat  meat to 160 °F and poultry to 165 °F before the dehydrating process.  This step assures that any bacteria present will be destroyed by wet  heat. But most dehydrator instructions do not include this step, and a  dehydrator may not reach temperatures high enough to heat meat to 160  °F. After heating, maintaining a constant dehydrator temperature of  130 to 140 °F during the drying process is important because: the  process must be fast enough to dry food before it spoils; and it must  remove enough water that microorganisms are unable to growthekitchn.com
How to quickly dry wet sneakers?
Whenever I attend music festivals I end up using the hair dryer in the hotel room.Not as easy as a clothes dryer, but it works :)Note: do not leave the hair dryer in the shoes or they'll light on fire.
How to get Urine stains out of carpet
Things I use:Substitute Vinegar with Ammonia. Using ammonia requires vigorous rubbing and possibly a scrub brush, but if you clean 2 to 3 times with this method the smell goes. Also, try substituting with dish washing liquid, the good smell can help get rid of the odour and do some deep cleaning. Make sure you add water or a residue may build up.Substituting with lemon juice works to, but can leave a stickyness unless you rinse with water or water down adequately. Mixing regular soap with baking soda helps with the odour and the mess. Hydrogen Peroxide and water. Start by dusting the stain with a thin coat of baking soda, then mix  up about a cup of hydrogen peroxide with a tablespoon of dish soap in  a spray bottle. Mix gently to combine. Then, saturate the baking soda  and the stain thoroughly. Use an old toothbrush or your fingers to  massage the mixture gently into the carpet, then let the mixture sit  until it dries. Vacuum up the mess and clean it again with cool  water.3 Hydrogen peroxide can damage some kinds of carpet, making it  important that you spot test this mixture in an out-of-the-way area of  the carpet to make sure that it won't stain the carpet irreparably.Apply pressure with books or a container to help with moisture wicking. Wicking the urine up is the first step in all methods and know what will damage your floor. Wet and dry vacuums help with moisture control Dogs like sniffing before they go know what your dog is allergic to and spray down some odours.VinegarEssential oils- peppermint, anything minty, especially if it is strong.Some perfumes, as they can have a burning smell. Additional Info:spotremoval.coit.com:Before doing anything else, if the area is still wet, be sure to blot  the urine stain with a clean towel. You can also use paper towels to  help absorb any remaining urine. To prevent further absorption, the  faster you do this, the better. If you have access to any kind of  shop-vac, use it to extract any remaining urine. If you don’t have  this tool, proceed to the next step. Take one-quarter teaspoon of  liquid dishwashing detergent and mix it with one cup of warm water. Be  sure to specifically use this kind, not laundry detergent or dish  soap; these may contain bleach or lanolin.  If you have a spray  bottle, pour the solution into it. Spray the urine stain, aiming  directly onto the carpet. If you can extract the solution from the  carpet using a shop-vac, this is a good next step. Otherwise, you can  use a cotton cloth or paper towels after the solution has set into the  stain. After rinsing the area with warm water, repeat steps 1-5, as  long as you’re seeing the urine stain gradually fade. Last, take two  tablespoons of ammonia and mix into a cup of water. Rinse and repeat  until the stain has disappeared.Wikihow: How to Remove Pet Urine from Carpetdogchatforums.comHomemade dog diapers?
How to seal envelopes without licking
The best alternative I found to licking was using a damp sponge. Simply tap the sticky part of the envelope on the wet sponge a few times and there you go.Lacking a sponge, anything like a washcloth, towel or paper towel will also work.
How to seal envelopes without licking
Another alternative is to use a glue stick, I found glue sticks to be very fast and efficient.A slower option is to use double sided tape as well, but certainly that's not easier than the other options, but if you hate licking it's an option as well. 
How to seal envelopes without licking
Buy envelopes with an adhesive band on the seal that's protected by an easy-to-remove film (“peel and seal”), like I do. Don't they make them in your country?You can apply ordinary office sticky tape: it's as fast as licking the rubber band, but it does look uglier.If you have to use envelopes with a rubber strip serving as do-it-yourself glue in, you can transfer saliva to your finger then move your finger over the gum on the envelope. This is significantly slower than licking though.You can use water instead of saliva, but it doesn't work as well. Warm water works better than cold water. If you have many envelopes to seal, keep a sponge or similar material handy.
How to get cat urine smell out of wooden floors?
Unfortunately, you can't.  I've had experience in this area.  We had a similar problem, and when we talked to cleaning professionals, they told us that if the wood is soaked with cat urine, the smell will never come out 100%.  We were told we had two options.  1) reseal the wood (but this is not a permanent solution.  Eventually the smell will seep through again).2) replace the wood.  We ended up doing that option.  The cleaners we talked to didn't recommend someone, so they weren't trying to shill for someone.  We ended up replacing the wood flooring ourselves.  It wasn't as hard a we thought it would be.  We also had to replace the subflooring, as the urine had soaked through there too.
What to do if your shaver broke halfway through shaving?
Adding yet another answer here, because my existing answer is already quite long and this one actually is a bit of a hack...In his now-deleted answer to your question on Judaism, user6591 suggests that using nail clippers is acceptable for this purpose. So in the interest of expanding our knowledge here, I tested this method. I found that......It works! Flat-edged toenail clippers cut facial hair relatively easily, without getting too close to the skin....It is difficult to get a close or even shave this way. Much patience is required for not very impressive results....It is excruciatingly slow. You might easily spend a half-hour to trim half of your face, if not more.Still, in an emergency you might find this a useful fall-back.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
I'm rather surprised I haven't seen it yet, so give it a chance before you write it off: rubber bands. Preferably the wider ones (1/4" or so).Just like you are back in elementary school snapping your friends, pull it back over your finger and let it fly. In 100% honesty, I find it easier to rid flies with this than with an actual flyswatter, I'm assuming you might find the same.Aiming is very easy, as you can usually get within a foot without spooking them, and because of the natural bendyness of the band, you only have to get relatively close to your mark to actually cripple or kill the fly.Pros:Does not use up resources (unless you break the band)CheapNo chemicals or smellsCons:Can leave small smears on your wall/windowSome people may have a hard time shooting it straight
Easiest way to remove adhesive from shirts?
I use warm (via a microwave) white vinegar to help dissolve the adhesive. Apply the warm vinegar with a sponge and let it soak before washing again. (Further reading)
How can I safely trim my fingernails without a fingernail clipper?
I actually use a pocket knife all the time, but only ones with serrated blades. Since they're serrated, you're able to keep the nail in the groove and just take off small chunks at a time.If you have scissors or some other method, it may be preferable, but I don't think I've ever brought scissors while camping (unless it is part of a multi-function tool like a Leatherman or Gerber). But I almost always have a pocket knife on me and all of mine have serrated sections on the blade. Obviously, this isn't foolproof, and you should exercise some caution if/when you use this method to prevent injury.
Easiest way to remove adhesive from shirts?
I understand adhesives you have mentioned here are mild like labels, tapes, Glues & stickers not the harder epoxy resins or wax glue. So I answer here only for mild adhesives.Mild adhesives can be removed by rubbing the sticky area with your fingers, which has to done first for all methods. Then follow the below methods which is easy for you to remove the residue.Method 1: Solidify the adhesive by keeping in freezer or rubbing the ice cube. Scrape the solid residue with your nail or any dull edged object, may be other edge of the table knife or spoon. Method 2: Try applying the petroleum jelly into the adhesive stain and it will loosen the glue. Then remove the petroleum jelly by rubbing the area with detergent soap. Use max hottest water mentioned in your garment care tag for rinsing the area. Use hot water only if it is fat adhesive.Method 3: Add any mild oil into the adhesive for loosening it. Baby oil, coconut oil, vegetable oil or butter may help. Then rinse the area with detergent soap.Method 4: Place duct tape on the sticky area, press firmly and peel off slowly.Method 5: Use nail polish remover on the sticky area. Acetone in the nail polish remover will help the task. Some nail polish may not contain acetone, check  it. Wash thoroughly and repeat if needed.Method 6: Place a paper kerchief or towel on the sticky area, then iron them firmly. You can peel off the residue by scrape. Method 7: Heat some vinegar and put some few drops in the concerned area. Wash throughly with the cold water. Recommend to test a drop on an inconspicuous spot before treating it.Method 8: If the adhesive is too greasy, then sprinkle some corn flour on the area. Then Allow it absorb the flour, scrape it. I have tested few methods and it worked like a charm.TIPS:-Quicker you do the workaround, you are likely to get the better result.-Use cold water always for rinsing. -test on an inconspicuous section before testing, such as the inside of a sleeve or collar. -Do not rub too harsh, as it may damage the fabric fibers.
How to get cat urine smell out of wooden floors?
Here are some ways to make your urine removal more effective, distilled from this answer on Pets Stack Exchange.Use a product (whether shop-bought or homemade) that breaks down the urine, not just kills the microbes that are acting on the urine. If you just kill the microbes, but don't break down the urine, more microbes will move in later and work on the urine, generating a new smell. Anything labelled as an "enzyme cleaner" should do this.Soak the area thoroughly. A common problem with home urine removal is that people don't soak the soiled area as thoroughly as the original urine soaked it. If you think about it, there is no way that anything that doesn't penetrate as far as the urine did can possibly remove all the smell, because it simply doesn't get far enough to remove it! So whatever you use, use a lot of it.
How to get cat urine smell out of wooden floors?
You were on the right track with baking soda, but it actually helps more to use vinegar to neutralize the smell of ammonia.Here's my explanation I gave in my answer to a similar question at Pets:Something else you can try is vinegar. It's actually really good at getting rid of carpet smells. Basically the vinegar smell replaces the smell of ammonia from the urine, and then you can easily dissipate the vinegar smell with an open window and a few minutes. Just makes sure to use a shop-vac or something to get all the moisture out of the carpet so it doesn't mold underneath.A lot of the times you won't necessarily want to use straight vinegar, most of the time it's 1/3 vinegar and water. Just mop the floor with the solution and get it into the floor to replace the old urine. Dry it out, and the smell should be gone.The best way I can explain how it works is that it works in the opposite way that baking soda does. Baking soda is described as absorbing the molecules that smell bad (which is why you put it in fridges), while vinegar will bind to and replace the molecules. This is preferable since the vinegar dissipates in air quickly. It's the same idea as standing in campfire smoke after getting sprayed by a skunk. The smell of smoke get's rid of the smell of skunk, and the smoke washes out with a good scrub of normal soap.
What is the best way to cool off with an oscillating fan without having it blowing directly on me?
You could make your own air conditioner.Basically what you want to do is take two different-sized containers (one has to fit inside the other). In the larger container you want to cut out a hole in the top so that you can set the fan on it and have air blowing into the container., and a few small holes in the side so that air can escape.Then, you take the smaller container, and fill it with ice. Simply place the container with ice into the larger container, then set the fan on top and turn it on. The fan will blow air over the ice which cools it, and the air will escape out the sides of the container. sourceI've seen different version of this made, some with 5-gallon buckets, but also some that have PVC pipe in the sides to direct the airflow. Something like that might be a good addition so that you can  direct the air to your space, and not your coworkers.An even dirtier solution than this, would be to place ziploc bags full of ice to the fan, that way it cools the air down even more. That should hopefully cool the air blowing from it enough that it doesn't need to be blowing directly on you to work. 
How to fasten a length of plastic rope which is just too short
With plastic or nylon rope you could cut the fussed ends and separate a few inches of the rope on each end into the individual strands. Most ropes will separate into 3 strands. Once you have the rope split on the ends just take the free strands and tie them to the bars or you can re twist and fuse them with the bar in the middle.Doing this will reduce the strength of the rope considerably, but if you're just hanging laundry and you start with a rope similar to the one in your picture it should be more the strong enough to hold.
How can I neatly eat messy food without "common" utensils?
Wear gloves while you are eating. When you are done, dispose of the gloves appropriately.If you don't have gloves, but do have some liquid white glue and are willing to wait a little while, you can cover your fingertips in glue, allow it to dry, eat, and then peel off the glue. Using glue does require that it be of a non-toxic type, dries fairly quickly, and will come off easily (cyanoacrylate or super glue is not a good choice).
How to seal envelopes without licking
An alternative to the wet sponge is your finger. Just dip it into a glas of water. Intuitive and always applicable.To answer the comment:Paper can cause cuts at it's rigde. Place the envelope flat on the table and apply the water. For a cut you won't have the right angle to the ridge.
Healthiest way to haul over-sized object in an automobile
There is not a way to drive with the back open, due to the air dynamic. The exhaust is always going to  come in the back. The best way to minimize this is to keep windows shut, and air vents pulling in air from the outside if you have that option on your car. This will give you a little positive pressure but not enough to really be safe from exhaust fumes. If you have wind wings on your car, not very common these days, opening those all the way so they act as a wind scope may give you enough air to keep the fumes out. If you have a vehicle able to pull a trailer, a trailer is a good way to overcome the open hatch. Trailers are often cheap to rent. However buying a small utility trailer can be an excellent option. The nice thing about buying over renting is that trailers, have a great resale value, I bought one used for 500, and sold it five years later for 500. Buying of course depends on if you have space for the trailer and how often you need a trailer.A roof rack may also work well. The main limitation to a roof rack is the weight. Most passenger vehicles really are not designed to work well with roof racks. However for a few pieces of plywood or half a dozen 2x4's this may meet your needs. I would not put a roof rack on my Honda civic, but maybe a larger SUV would accommodate this just fine.Another option is to make friends with someone that owns a pickup truck. You can best decide how this works for you. I know when I had a pickup truck many years ago, I would avoid making friends with people making friends because they needed a favor involving the pickup truck, unless of course she was cute.The last option involves plastic sheeting and duct tape. Yes duct tape and plastic the stuff of last resort when you need to temporarily seal a space. Load your stuff and then use duct tape and plastic to seal off the back end for the drive home. Might not work very well for longer drives home that involve freeway speeds. If you have an suv/station wagon you could make the seal between the cargo department and passenger department. Should not be used when wet.Another option for a cheap roof rack is stiff Styrofoam, place the load on a couple of pieces of the Styrofoam and tie down your load by running rope through the windows. Use caution and perhaps use some kind of shield between the rope and any points that it contacts the car. Please be very careful with long lumbar like 2x4 framing studs. This kind of load is very unstable, and you will find your self with a hood full of lumbar if you need to do a quick stop.All of these methods involve costs. If you have a vehicle that can pull a trailer buying a used trailer is by far the most cost effective, and perhaps the most convenient. Finding a bud with a pickup may be cheaper, just depends on how much gas and beer you need to purchase. Permanent roof racks with any muscle tend to be expensive, and also reduce your gas mileage over time. Plastic and duct tape do not reuse well, and also take a lot of time.Since your just getting a couple of 8 foot 2x4's, leave the tail gate shut and run them at an angle out the passengers side window, tying them off to the mirror, depending on the size of your vehicle it is typically only a foot or two that comes out the window.  
How can I repair a broken jewel case?
In the comments a few people agreed that you really cannot fix this. I agree, even if you still had the broken piece gluing it back on would involve purchasing a plastic glue that would cost as much as the diamond case, and the glued joint would be nowhere as strong as the original hinge.But you do need options and here are my suggestions.Sooner or later you will come across a diamond case. You might see CDs or DVDS at a garage sale for cheap. You might loose one of your CDS and find you have a spare, a friend may have on laying around. You might pick one up at the goodwill for a quarter.Until then use a rubber band to keep the case intact and closed.
How to quickly dry wet sneakers?
Even if you would rather not put your dirty sneakers in the dryer directly, you can still use the dryer to dry them...Locate your exterior dryer vent and place your shoes under the vent. The hot air blowing from the vent will speed up the drying process.Or if your dryer vent is on the roof or otherwise inconveniently located...Place your shoes inside an old pillow case and tie the pillow case shut. Then toss the bundle in your dryer and tumble dry on the lowest setting. Provided that your not trying to dry huge heavy boots the dryer should be not damaged by the shoes bouncing around inside and the pillowcase should contain any dirt the comes loose from the shoes. I use option 1 for my combats and option 2 for my chucks, both work pretty well.
How can I (painlessly) add/remove keys to my key ring?
If you carry a small pocketknife, like me, you can use that to slip into the crack, and pry open. Stick your key into the crack, from either side, remove the blade, and slide the key in/out of the ring. This is convenient for me, because I carry both my posketknife and my keys in my pockets, so their with me all the time.Warning: Blades are often sharp. use common sense and try not to cut yourself.
How to retrieve items from under a refrigerator?
If it's not too far back, a wire clothes hanger can be used. Locate the battery with a flashlight. Hold one end of the wire hanger, and push the other end of the hanger to the top of the fridge underside, until it has gone past the battery. Then let it down to the floor, and slowly draw it out. It will pull the battery with it.Wire hangers work better for me because my fridge is low, so I'm less likely to push the item farther back with the hanger. If your fridge is high enough, I suppose a plastic one would work well because it would be less easy for the battery to slip out.
Waking up in the morning when standard alarms fail
The priceless component in this operation is a simple plug timer: The price on these can go from anywhere from $5 for simple rotary models to $30 for high end digital models. The fun part is that you can plug just about anything into them and have it turn on when you're ready to wake up in the morning.Some things you may already have at home that can be used to wake you up:Electric leaf blower, hit yourself with a firm blast of air.Space heater, make your bedroom uncomfortably hot.Coffee maker, the best part of waking up is...Bright lights or Strobe lights, for those that are sensitive to bright lights.I saved the best for last... Take an old box fanRemove the front grate and the fan bladeReplace the fan blade with an unbalanced load.  An off center block of wood should work Or you can just break off a few of the individual blades leaving one or two on the same sideReplace the front grateAttach it to the underside of your bed or to a bed postSet the timer and plug the modified fan into the timerAs you can probably guess the spinning unbalanced load will cause the whole contraption to shake and when attached to the bed it will shake the bed considerably. You can use most any old device with a sturdy electric motor, but a box fan also comes with a cage/housing making it a bit safer to use.
How to retrieve items from under a refrigerator?
If you have access to the side, you can use a yard stick or broom handle to sweep the contents under the fridge forward.If you have easy access to the front with a couple of inches (3 to 5 cm) clearance on the side, you can still sweep the item (this time to the side of the fridge) and use the yard stick to slide out the item from the side.One of the nice things about this technique is that locating the object is not usually required.Substitute other sticks as necessary.
Easiest way to remove adhesive from shirts?
Once I removed adhesive with a piece of useless cloth, which I put over the adhesive and press it with hot iron. Then wait a little for the adhesive to become cool and pull the piece of cloth. The idea is the adhesive to stick stronger on the peace of cloth rather than on the shirt. But keep in mind, this method is not working for all types of adhesive!
Healthiest way to haul over-sized object in an automobile
I've done this as few times. My best solution; drive with all car windows open. You need to have the space in your car as much ventilated as you can.In another answer @Jon suggests turning on the air vents. This is insufficient and could cause you to feel nauseated.
How can I tell if an egg has gone bad without cracking it open?
If you are in a situation where bringing water adds another burden to you, you can identify the quality of an egg by gently shaking it and hearing it. This works like a charm in me.It states in the Source:Take an egg from the refrigerator and hold it up to your ear. Shake it gently. If it's fresh, it won't make a sound. If it's on the older side, the egg will make a slight rattle. But according to this source there is a warning hereShaking an egg next to your ear to see (or rather hear) if it's rotten works without fail for me. Eggs that have gone bad make the characteristic sound of something splashing around inside the shell while fresh eggs make no sound at all.For those not used to this method of detection, a word of caution  might be in order. Do not hold the egg too tightly or shake too  energetically. It is not that in case you do so you will fail to  detect a rotten egg. Detection will be as easy or even easier in this  case. However, there may be undesirable side effects.
How to make neat, round pancakes
Pour the batter into metal cookie cutters on the pan. You can pull them off after it's cooked one side and ready to flip, will give you a much cleaner outline and clearer shape of whatever you're aiming for (provided you buy a cookie cutter in that shape), just be careful that they're metal and you don't burn yourself with them.
How do you test if batteries are good?
You can make one with a bulb/LED and a paper clip...Use the bulb from the flashlight or a LED.set the battery on the positive end of the battery to be tested.take a paper clip and bend it into a makeshift "C"touch one end of the paper clip to the negative (flat/bottom) end of the battery.touch the other end of the paper clip to the bulb side.You may need to use adhesive tape to help you, or get a friend / third hand to help hold the items together to make a good contact.If the battery is good, the bulb will light up (if correct connections are made on the battery AND bulb). The brighter the bulb, the more juice the battery has.NOTE: If the bulb doesn't light up right away, make sure you fiddle with the connections a bit before you discard the battery.
How do you test if batteries are good?
You can test if your batteries are dead by dropping them on a hard surface - just 5cm worked for me.If your battery is alive, it will not bounce, and a discharged one will. Why?A non-rechargeable battery begins with zinc powder mixed into a gel containing a  manganese dioxide powder. As the battery discharges manganese dioxide powder changes to manganese oxide so the granules start to bond chemically. This packed-sand consistency reduces the anti bounce effect caused by the original gel mixture.Source: LifehackerAnti bounce is caused because the gel inside moves slower than the battery, so as the battery tries to bounce back up, the gel inside is still falling and stops it.
What can I do when the handle breaks and falls off my screen door?
I found a hack that works well for me:Use a vice-grip as the door handle. If you make it tight enough, it won't slip.This works well because it allows for proper use of the door, and there is no need to put something on the shaft each time you open the door, like there is in the method mentioned in the question. There is one problem, and that is: It really looks awful. Not a very attractive solution, but I guess that's some incentive to get the new handle quickly. Here's a photo:
Hacked Chanukah Menorahs
I always remember to bring my own menorah ;-) ....but here are some things I've seen done.You can use Styrofoam cups, a favorite of my friends':Another option would be to use a Styrofoam plate, like this:I've also seen some more exotic things, like donuts (aka sufganiyot), or a banana:( Note: I don't know if the above two were ever used, but there's no reason why they shouldn't work. )I've also seen (sorry, no pics for these!) soda cans used, in one of a few ways: either fill an empty can with mostly water, and about half an inch of oil on top, and plop a floating wick in there; put a glass oil cup in the open top of a can; or turn a can upside down, and fill that bottom cavity of the can with oil, and put a floating wick in there.This isn't so hacky, but a lot of people ignore the fact that a lot of those cases of pre-filled oil cups come with either a small, plastic menorah, or those rubber oil cup holders, which can be used to fill in for a more permanent menorah. ( mine actually didn't, this year )All of the above probably suffer from some form of issue with hiddur, though that may or may not be a problem ;-)Happy Chanukah!! :^)
How to remove large quantity of dust from electronic/mechanical equipment?
I would say clean the machine good once a year or twice, timing depends and in between doing this to reduce dust accumulation in the room, because you can't stop it accumulating on the electronic:Remove pets, especially birds and cats from the room. These help dust accumulate.Seal up cracks. Dust can get into the room through these and affect your device.Clean dust frequently. Dust that accumulates in the room can get into the device. Airing a room is important, but avoid hot dusty days.Remove cluttering items and pack away things neatly. Dust can accumulate in corners and on objects.I haven't really used air purifiers, but I have cleaned air filters, the article says get air purifiers. Air purifiers remove dust and other stuff from the air.Things I use:Whisk the outside clean with a brush. This doesn't clean the inside but may loosen inner dust.Now swab with cotton swabs, you can get longer ones.Since the swabs probably loosened the dust, taking a vacuum or shop vac and sucking with it should remove loosened dust and the stuff you couldn't reach.Using water should make the dust stick together, which from my experience is not a good thing. Blowing the dust pushes it farther away which is not a good thing either. A cleaning where you take the electronic a part is good to do once or twice a year.Vacuuming should be done first and then you should do blowing to loosen more dust and finish with more vacuuming. Don't vacuum vigorously as this can loosen and injure pieces of the device.Alternate Methods:Taking microfibre clothe attached to a small long object usually works, as well. You can use this to reach inside of the vents, but make sure you can see through to what you are doing. This loosens dust and can make using a vacuum more effective. Keep in mind that none of these methods work as good as taking the machinery apart. And probing your machine through vents when you have no idea of what you are going to touch is a bad idea. So always make sure you know what you are going to touch and are aware of any dangers. The machine should be off, if not it is not safe and cleaning should not be attempted.howtocleanstuff.netBefore completing any cleaning method on your computer, it is  important to back up all of your files. Even though this is unlikely  to cause any damage, it’s always better to be safe than sorry.Shut down the computer and unplug all of the cords from the CPU. Take  it outside or in an area that is well ventilated. When we get further  into this process, the dust will start flying.And be careful about vacuuming and compressed air.It’s bad to clean the inside of your computer with a vacuum cleaner  because vacuuming creates a large static build up that could (and most  likely will) discharge into the sensitive electronics inside your  computer case. There are specialized vacuum cleaners designed for  cleaning out computers and electronic equipment but given the limited  amount of use a single user would get from such a purchase it’s not a  very wise one—they start at $300+ and can easily break the $1000 price  barrier.What we’d recommend doing is taking your computer case into a well  ventilated area (outside on a sunny day or in your garage is a great  place), grounding the case to protect against static discharge  (although the risk here is very very low) and using compressed air to  clean the dust off. If you’re using an air compressor (as opposed to  just a can of compressed air from the computer store) make sure to  start a good 24″ or so away from the case and work your way in closer.  You want to use just enough air pressure to blast the dust off the  surfaces and out of the case without overdoing it and pushing dust  into even more difficult to remove places.One important thing to consider: compressed air (from a compressor,  not a can) contains minute amounts of water vapor. Although we’ve  never actually heard of this happening to anyone it is (however remote  the chance) possible to blow moisture into the connectors on your  mother board and damage it if you were to boot it immediately  afterwards. This is in the range of lightening-strike remote, however.  None the less to be extra cautious we would recommend that you leave  the computer off and in a warm dry location for a few hours after you  give it a good air-compressor cleaning to allow any residual moisture  (if it’s even there to begin with) to evaporate. This borders on  paranoid caution, mind you, but better safe than sorry.Additional Infohomesessive.com:Compressed air: Sold in a can, compressed air is perfect for blasting  dust and dirt between keyboard keys and other tight crevices.Electrostatic cloths (Swiffer, Pledge Dry Cloths, etc.): These dusters  are typically made of finely woven synthetic fibers with tiny "hairs"  that create a magnetic charge and pull dust particles.Microfiber cloths: Unlike paper towels or rags, microfiber cloths  easily trap dust between their fibers instead of spreading more dust  and lint. Bonus: Unlike wood-source products like napkins and paper  towels, these cloths won't scratch sensitive surfaces and can be  washed up to 500 times.Stuff I haven't tried. From the User Ainimache:Is to blow through a straw. I'm sure I'll be told that's not clean  air, but it's better than nothing, and does a fair job.Especially when you're cleaning out someone's older computer that  simply is caked in dust inside.You can use the straw to direct the air flow somewhat, and if you  can't get the force you can out of a can of air, blowing through a  straw doesn't freeze what you're cleaning.Get Rid of DustFox News:Don't use feather dusters.Feather dusters only aggravate existing dust and cause it to settle  elsewhere around your home. Instead, use a damp cloth or moist  towelette to wipe down surfaces.Remove carpeting.It may look gorgeous, but carpeted floors are high-maintenance and  magnets for dust mites. They should be vacuumed daily, but even that  may not be enough for people with severe allergies. If you're attached  to your carpet, consider investing in a vacuum cleaner with a  double-layered microfilter bag or a high-efficiency particulate air  (HEPA) filter, which prevents dust from being re-introduced into the  air. Otherwise, stick to hardwood, vinyl, linoleum or tile flooring.
Homemade car CD holder
Here are some plans I wanted to try:If you are handy with sewing, here is a design similar to your second design.urban threads.comIts basically where you sew pockets onto a board that is covered with cloth. The board can be made of cardboard or another light weight hard object. I planned to modify this pattern to hang on the back of the seat, though. Also, have you tried labelling the CD'S. Taking a piece of tape and creating a tag out of it should work. Mushroomvillagers.wordpress.com This plan takes a lot of sewing. It is mostly sewed together pockets, but you may be able to avoid this by taking large pockets from other pieces of clothing and adhering them together, by adding elastic bands on the back you should be able to create a design that is similar to the one above. Using Duct tape or cloth glue for the steps should work. Other things that will work for creating pockets:Paper.Additional InfoOther CD covering ideas.odee.com: Not helpful, but really cool.

What can I do when the handle breaks and falls off my screen door?
Look very closely at the part of the handle that goes over your stub. Especially the downside. There should be a screw there, usually with an Allen head. It may be covered with paint so all you might see is a dimple. If you find it tighten it down, you might want to use some thread lock on the thread to keep it tight. A closer look at your picture shows little stub at the end of the shaft, if that is the case the handle was likely pressed on and I recommend replacing the whole unit.If that is not found you may want to try some kind of metal glue like liquid weld to secure it. Be careful if you over apply you will have a mess and you just may also end up gluing the handle to the door instead of just to the latching mechanism.Last option is to replace the whole door lock. This is not a bad option because often when your kind of problem happens fixes do not tend to be all that reliable, and you just may end up doing this after going through a fix or two that has a short life.Vice grips mentioned in another answer are an excellent temp fix to make the door usable until you can come up with something more lasting.
Homemade car CD holder
Use your current cd holder, but put a strip of masking tape on each page. Use a marker to write the title of the cd on each strip of tape.Another trick would be to put the cd's in order. Before you leave, put them in the order you want to play them, from the front to the back of the case.
How to remove large quantity of dust from electronic/mechanical equipment?
In our office I can see that the IT staffs can clean around 30 computers within just an hour or two, by being curious enough I investigate their techniques.First they will move the computers and put them in an open area so they can blow the inside of a cpu case. Take note that they are using a strong blower not just an ordinary one.Once they are finished on blowing the computer I notice that all the chunks of dirt inside are easily removed.Then they will use a cotton or worn out cloth or a rag to thoroughly clean the remaining parts. You can wet it if it is applicable. If they are in rush hour they dont do this step anymore.

How do I open a bottle without a bottle opener?
There are many, many options for bottle cap removal. As mentioned but not really explained there's the lighter trick:The key to this method is having a tight grip on the neck of the bottle so that your hand/fulcrum doesn't move when you apply force with the lighter/lever. You can apply this method with most anything you have lying around: keys, spoons, or even other beer bottles, not just lighters. A friend of mine used to do a party trick where he would open two bottles in one motion, its was a risky trick though he would usually spill at least one of the beers.Another option is the counter top method:This method will tend to chip and scratch most counter tops so I don't recommend it. You just sit the lip of the cap on the edge of a counter or table and smack the top of the bottle. If you can find a surface that isn't likely to be damaged this method is pretty reliable though. You can also pry the cap lose with a knife or key:Again I don't really recommend this method, its tedious and slow, but it works. You work the edge of a key under the individual folds in the cap and pry them out. after going half way around the bottle the cap should come off easily.See this wikiHow article for a few more options, most are more or less variations on the same basic principles described above using different tools, but it does give some pretty good step by step directions.

What is the best way to get rid of steam on a mirror?
Here are some methods I use:Shaving CreamBefore you shower, wipe some shaving cream onto your bathroom mirror.  It will keep it from fogging up so you don’t have to wait to get to  work with your toiletries or shaving after you get out of the shower.For me this works really well. Here is how it works:thenakedscientists.comDave -   In some senses, it doesn’t actually stop it steaming up.   Steam is lots of little droplets of water.  When the light hits it,  the light gets bent and so you get a very distorted image which, when  you move away from it, just looks like a kind of mist.  What the  shaving foam does: there are lots of detergents in it and those  detergents reduce the surface tension of the film of water so it  doesn’t form lots of little droplets.  It just forms a big flat sheet  that you can see through much better, so you can see through it even  though the water is still condensing.Ben -   So there’s literally the same amount of water there; it’s just  a change in the structure of the water.  So why do the droplets make  it so hard to see things?Dave -   Because water has quite a high refractive index - when light  hits it, it bends.  If it hits this curved surface of a droplet, each  one basically acts as a little tiny lens, light is bounced off in all  sorts of different directions and makes it looks essentially white.   This breaks up the image and makes it look misty.eHow.com:1 quart spray bottle2 tbsp. household ammonia1/2 cup rubbing alcohol3 drops dish soap1). Pour 2 tbsp. of ammonia, 1/2 cup rubbing alcohol and three drops  dish soap into a 1 quart bottle.2). Fill the bottle with tap water, tilting the bottle while filling to  minimize suds.3). Screw on the spray mechanism tightly to avoid leakage. Your anti-fog  glass cleaner is now ready to use in the same manner as a store bought  glass cleaner.For me this works up to 10 minutes and works on glass lenses for glasses, as well. This works better if you apply several coats and can also be used for cleaning the glass. VinegarCreating a 50-50 solution of vinegar and water will also do the trick.  Instead of buying a mirror cleaner like Windex, which has a ton of  chemicals inside, you can use this all-natural cleaner instead.Simply pour a cup of water and a cup of vinegar into an old spray  bottle, add a drop or two of dishwashing soap and spray. Wipe the  mirror with a towel and the glass should stay steam-proof for a few  days.Vinegar does have an odor, but it should go away within an hour. You  can also add lemon juice for a fresh smelling bathroom.Also using blow dryers are suppose to be:if you forgot or don't feel like applying anything to your mirror, you  can use a blow dryer to quickly eliminate the water from your mirrors.Is there a technique to make a shower mirror fog-free?:This Q&A has a lot of methods, that can be bought. Some methods for making these products more effective are:Turn a fan on while you shower.Take your mirror down while you shower and put a towel over it. Wait 5 minutes after a shower, and then put it back up. Or apply the towel while it stands up.Also, using thicker products like shaving cream and makes them stay longer. Soap with the water in the air can wash off.   Putting warm objects on the mirror works, as well. Additional Info and things I don't know workCar WaxPrevent your bathroom mirror from steaming up after your next hot  shower. Apply a small amount of car paste wax to the mirror, let it  dry, and buff with a soft cloth. Next time you step out of the shower,  you’ll be able to see your face in the mirror immediately. Rub the wax  on bathroom fixtures to prevent water spots too.Dish SoapUsing a light coating of dishwashing liquid can also do the trick.  Place a few droplets of soap onto your palm and add water. Wipe this  soapy hand across the face of the mirror and then wipe clean with a  paper towel. Voilà.Mirror should remain clear for about a day; then you can simply repeat  the process. Using this method is also handy for creeping out other  shower users. Simply lather your hands in soap, write your message and  wipe.From LifeHacker.com KeithS Comments:Actually, dish detergent is better than bath soap because it doesn't  leave a soap scum film.Walker Answers:A good ventilation fan to remove the steam is the first step. Then you  need a heated mirror, or you can try to put a floor heating mat behind  the mirror.

How can I boost my wifi range?
Use a sheet of aluminum foil behind the antennas. By using foil, you will reflect the signal going away from your devices back toward your devices.However, since your goal is to transverse multiple levels of floors, this won't be very effective. Instead, get a wi-fi repeater. If you have -- or a friend is willing to give you -- an old router, there's a good chance it can be setup as a repeater, perhaps on the second floor.if you're unable to obtain a repeater or place it on the second floor, and the tin foil trick doesn't help, your remaining option is to buy a more powerful router.
Permanent marker on a dry erase board?
Things I know work:If the stain just happened using mineral oil and some essential oils works. When using essential oils make sure to wipe the board down thoroughly and not to leave the raw oil on for to long(over 1-2 minutes) as this can remove the boards finish. Letting the mineral oil sit helps to loosen it, though. The longer it sits the better. Remember not to scratch the surface of the board and so avoid scraping the marker off. These scratches make it so that the ink can get in and discolour the board it is usually hard to remove those stains. How to Remove Permanent Marker from a Smooth Surface.

How can I safely trim my fingernails without a fingernail clipper?
A nail file works the best. As a person going into the medical field I don't want to have to explain what can happen to you if you use one of these methods and accidentally hurt yourself. Knives are really good ideas if used properly, if not the following can happen:Some sort of infectionBlood PoisoningLoss of limb, because of one of the aboveDeath because of one of the aboveThe best methods are to:Use disposable nail files.Use a metal nail file. Usually this is attached to a pocket knife or you can get freely attached ones. Make your own. Taking a length of sand paper and a board, even a popsicle stick and glueing the sand paper in place can make your own nail files, these are cheaper and better because you can use different roughnesses of  sand paper.Nail Files are better for your nails, as they smooth out any breakages. Scissors can be used, but who really carries scissors with them all the time. If you plan on using large scissors  then you are better off biting. Invest in a small pocket knife or other multi function tool that is small, that way you will probably have small scissors, a nail file, a knife, and depending on the type you got a nail clipper, keeping it on you key ring helps not loose it. Clean your nails before even attempting to bite them off. Also, sterilize your knife before even attempting to use it, this will protect you better if you decide to use it.Using any rough surface also works, like rough rocks. But be sure to avoid fomites like wirecutters, and dirty knifes.  Knife blades used for cooking(especially meat) unless cleaned properly can result in infection and since you can't reach a  Emergency Room that means that whatever happens to you with that knife you will have to deal with yourself. For your own safety I hope you are medically trained.Try putting the nail clippers in the first aid kit and leaving it there. That way you are less likely to lose them. You might want to try:Taking a rock or piece of metal and heating it up extremely. Now take your fingers and press the nails to the hot surface, the heat will burn them low. After doing this carefully, plunge your hands into cool water and file with a nail file, if possible. This is better on long nails. Only do this if you are confident around fire. And don't press a live fire to your fingertips. Just heated up objects.

How to wrap a gift so it doesn't look like the gift?
Use a cardboard box larger than the gift, and gift wrap the box.If you don't have a large box, you could -- depending on the gift -- place smaller, disposable objects such as foam cups or crumpled newspaper around the gift to alter its shape under the wrapping paper.
How to wrap a gift so it doesn't look like the gift?
You can wrap them in the following methods:Use cardboard or Newspaper. This can be done by crumpling the newspaper around the item or by plainly putting them in a cardboard box.Putting them in cleaned cereal boxes is a good method and really small gifts can be concealed in origami. Its kind of tricky to fold them in though.For something more fancy looking:Buzzfeed.com:Wrap them in Balls of Yarn. This is good as you can have any colour of yarn, but retrieving them can be tricky and wrapping them can be trickier.Folding the gift into a sweater or other article of clothing. This is good for books and other items. Wrapping them in clothe also works. The buzzfeed.com article wraps them in scarves. This is good for giving two gifts. This article also shows putting gifts into a sweater sleeves. Not very concealing, but cute.Use paper or plastic bags. Paper bags are more decorative. You shouldn't add the buttons and such because that totally gives it away. A large black bag would work, but be sure to let the air stay in it.

Removing mold from walls without use of harmful chemicals
You can use hydrogen peroxide in a spray bottle to kill the mold and then just wipe it away.It is probably worth noting that the mold that you can actually see is very likely the tip of the iceberg. If you can see mold growing on the wall it is pretty likely that there is mold inside of the wall as well.It is also probably worth checking your roof/plumbing for leaks, molds usually need a pretty damp enviroment. If you can find the source of the water you may be able to solve the problem for good. 
What is the best way to get rid of steam on a mirror?
The simplest way I have found to keep my bathroom mirrors fog free is to rub a white candle all around the glass and then polish it in with a soft cloth. The wax makes any moisture bead up and roll away.

I've used a toaster oven to finish food when my lpg tank ran out. I've also used my rice cooker as well. 
What is the best way to get rid of steam on a mirror?
The mirror is fogging up (and will keep fogging up) because the air in the bathroom is warm and humid, and the mirror is a nice, cool place to condense on.  Get rid of the warm water in the air!  After you get out of the shower, run the shower on cold for a little while; it will cool down the air, and the humidity will condense in the cooled-off inside of the shower instead of your mirror.  The mirror will slowly unfog as the moisture evaporates, and it will help condensation from re-occuring if you wipe it off.
What is the least painful and most effective way to keep chest shaved?
You mentioned you have 'heard that hair removal cream burns'.  Try using it on a small area.  It doesn't burn most people, but leaving it on longer (for thicker hair) and multiple applications within a short window will increase the chances of it burning.  If it works without leaving a chemical burn or redness on a small area, try it on your whole chest.  It can be much, much easier than shaving.Epilators will also work, but they function by actually pulling the hair out by the roots, which, yes, is painful, and you don't want that.
How can I fill the house with a pleasant smell at the last minute?
A great way to create a pleasant smell is to take a couple of caps (not cups) of vanilla and place them in an oven-safe mug or something similar.

Removing mold from walls without use of harmful chemicals
The user Apaul34208 is correct. But since this is my job I must tell you that it is crucial to find the source of the mould. The source could be a pipe leak, roof leak or etc. There could be some serious problems behind the mould that need to be identified before the problem is resolved. When it comes to just fixing mould problem none of those products cannot be harmful since you are not using it in the whole house or every day. When and only when you find the source of the problem and fix it can you remove this using a reputable product, and when it dries you can apply acrylic based paint.
How can I fill the house with a pleasant smell at the last minute?
I have heard the story of Real Estate agents that bake a batch of cookies in the oven at the house they are going to show for an "open house".  (I am not certain if this is a myth or fact, but the theory seems sound.) Not only would this fill the house with a pleasant, and tasty smell, the theory is that it makes the house they are showing more appealing and feel more like a "home".In your case, this would give the house a smell you are looking for (pleasant) and a wonderful side effect is that you have a batch of cookies to present to your guests!
How to wrap a gift so it doesn't look like the gift?
Often times I have used multiple boxes wrapped within each other (like the classic "Russian Nesting Dolls") to mask the appearance of a smaller, more recognizable gift. Not only does this add to the illusion of what the gift is, or might be (and to the work for you, however), it adds a bit of fun to the process of opening the gift.If the gift is either too large for the nesting theory, I have taken parts of boxes an taped or "added" to the length before. This makes the box either longer, wider or taller... sometimes even odd shaped if you care to be "silly" with the process.I have also been known to add sections of the inner cardboard tubes to the gift in odd places from either toilet paper, paper towel, or even wrapping paper rolls. This interesting shape helps to mask the appearance easily. And, you can place a few rocks, pieces of candy, change, small jingle bells or the like within the tubes so they "rattle" a bit within the void and this too adds to the subterfuge of what the gift may be.As a last resort, I have wrapped a picture of the larger gift within a small package before to entirely throw the individual off. Not only is this a great trick, it saves on a TON of paper and tape if the gift is quite large. Imagine the surprise a person would have if they opened up a photo of their new bike, new ice skates, a laptop/tablet, Playstation or Xbox...especially if the box was the size of an earring box!
How to brush my teeth without using a Toothbrush or using floss
The solutions for this problem I have found:Diclaimer: The following methods do little to clean between the teeth.From eHow: Twigs: Can be used only once, but is okay to be used if cleaned for up to a week or a few days.Licorice, neem, senna, arak, birch, persimmon, eucalyptus and elm are  woody plants a person can use as a toothbrush.To use a twig as a toothbrush, chew on the end for a while, until it  gets bristly with fibers. This chewing helps clean between your teeth.  You also can use the fibers to clean your gum line and tooth surfaces  in a gentle, circular motion, like with a commercial toothbrush. The  twigs should be used only once, then composted.But there is a thing called a Miswak:You do have to use a peeler (or knife if you’re handy that way) to  scrape off about 1/2 inch of the bark away. Then you chew on it until  the fibers separate, and you can get right to work. At first some of  the outer fibers will break off in your mouth – but then you’re pretty  much all set.This article uses a piece of wood from something called a Peelu Tree, but other branches can be used. Know what is posoinous before you put it into your mouth. But most fruit tree woods are safe and have favourable taste. If you are careful no splinters will reuslt and these can make your feel fresh. Charcoal: Possibly reusable, but depends on the size of the charcoal and how messy you got itCharcoal, a tooth cleaner used in Malaysia, can be taken from a fire  pit after the fire has gone out, ground in a mortar and pestle with  some sage, mint, cinnamon or eucalyptus, and rubbed on the teeth. It  won’t stain your teeth; it rinses off easily.This is a nice method, but you don't have to ground it as then it is more of a toothpaste. Rinsing your mouth after use is suggested. Sage Leaves: Not reusableIn the Ibicencan tradition, sage is rubbed thoroughly on the surfaces  of the teeth for a tooth-scrubbing and refreshing experience. Sage is  a good scrubber; it also is delicious and is a mild antiseptic, too.  It can help heal ulcers in the mouth.Other leaves, such as Berry leaves work as well. Some herb leaves work, but most mint leaves are to small and fragile. Crushing these mint leaves and rubbing the solution against teeth works a little. You may be able to use smaller leaves, but be careful.Fibrous Foods: Not reusable, unless you refrigerate pieces of the fibrous foodUse fibrous foods that require lots of chewing, such as apples, celery  or carrots, to massage gum lines and tooth surfaces. To be effective,  these must be used after every time you eat--even if it’s just a  mid-afternoon snack.A lot of people use  fibrous dog biscuits to clean their dogs teeth instead of biscuits. Mouthwash should be used after this to remove traces of sugar and other destructive factors. These need to be used frequently otherwise the tartar builds up and can't be removed using this method. Fibrous food is quite good for you, as it helps with peristalsis and is essential for weight loss.Paper Towels Find a clean paper towel and wrap it around your index finger. Try to  find the thickest type of paper towel you can, ideally something that  will hold up to a little friction.Wet the towel with clean water and put a small amount of toothpaste on  it. Start with just a dab so that your teeth aren’t completely covered  in toothpaste, and you can see what you’re doing. You can add more  toothpaste as you work.Paper towels aren't the best method, and are similar to washclothes, but if you use the flossing alternatives noted below you should be OK. Chew sugar free gum twenty minutes after you eat to keep your mouth fresh – it also helps prevent tooth decay! Look for gum recommended by the American Dental Association (ADA); there will be an ADA label on the gum package.Sugar free gum can clean between gums to a certain degree. And this is a sustainable method.Cleaning between the teeth:Cactus or Pine Needle(from the eHow article) Cactus or pine needles are good for scraping plaque from in between  your teeth. Similar to a toothpick, these are not a flossing  substitute, but these scrapers are a good complement to an alternative  toothbrush. Other toothpicks used throughout history include porcupine  quills and shards of bone.Using common thread is good for using as alternative cloos. It fits between your teeth and you have a whole spool. It can be stronger than regular floss to, I use quilting thread.  Sinews from plants works to, but a lot can be to big  and short to fit between teeth. Taking mouth wash and swishing it around in your mouth can clean between teeth as well. 
How can I fill the house with a pleasant smell at the last minute?
Here are some ideas:If you're cooking dinner for your guests, start before they arrive. This means the house will smell nice when they get there, and as a bonus, you'll have less time you have to spend in the kitchen whilst they're present.Warm an orange in the oven or microwave (use a low setting in the microwave - you don't want it to explode!) and place it in the room you're going to be in. Waming the fruit makes it easier for the vapours to spread into the air and diffuse throughout the room.Alternatively, just eat an orange in the room your guests will be in! I often find that with all the peeling and tearing of the skin and the cells, the place around where I ate the orange ends up quite strongly orange-flavoured.Burn scented candles, if you have them. If you don't have them, burn normal candles with a few drops of essential oil (including vanilla essence or other oils used for cooking, not just oils bought exclusively for frangrance purposes) rubbed gently on the cold candle before you light it.N.B. Don't use perfume or artificial chemicals - chances are they will be highly flammable!Fill a bowl full of boiling water and add a few drops of lemon juice or peppermint essence or anything else aromatic to it. Put the bowl in the room that the guests will be in. The water vapour fills the room and carries the smell with it. Unless you have awesome presentation skills, you probably want to remove it before they arrive ;)Make coffee, if you have the equipment. Freshly brewed coffee scents the room quite nicely, and your guests can drink it when it's ready.
How to brush my teeth without using a Toothbrush or using floss
One option for flossing is to use your hair. If you can pull out a piece of your hair (this shouldn't be too hard) you can use it to floss between your teeth. This works best with thicker longer hair. For brushing your teeth you can use a paintbrush (most types should work). You can just apply toothpaste and use it as a regular toothbrush. Detail BrushPros: If it has hard bristles, detail brushes can be used to clean certain parts of your teeth and they can also be used as floss if you have teeth gaps that are a bit wider.Cons: Harder to get toothpaste on, can take longer if you are cleaning all of your teethFlat/Angular FlatPros: Easy to put toothpaste on, hard bristle ones can clean well, angular flats can easily reach and clean molars.Cons: Soft bristle ones are very flimsy and do not clean well.Fan BrushDo not use these, too flimsy and they do not clean well.Bright BrushesPros: IMO the best kind to use, clean well. In painting they are meant for short strokes, and that also works while brushing your teeth. Easy to apply toothpaste to.Cons: Soft bristle ones do not clean as well as hard bristle one, also a bit trickier to reach the molars.Image credit: Image from Types of brushes-article from http://www.art-is-fun.com/
How can I fill the house with a pleasant smell at the last minute?
An hour may not be enough time, but if you have a bread machine, make a loaf of bread; lacking that, if you will be eating dinner and have dinner rolls on hand, warming them up in the oven will create a pleasant scent.
Remove rust stains from sink
Try using:Salt and Lemon juiceRid rust with WD-40. Wipe WD-40 (lighter fluid works, too) on the spot  with a cloth and then rinse thoroughly. For rust stains on porcelain  enamel sinks, pour salt on half of a lemon and rub it on the stain.Baking Soda: This mixed with soap or a acid makes a good cheap scouring powder.Not a LifehackPumice Scouring StickA pumice scouring stick works well for removing stains from porcelain.  I don’t recommend it for fiberglass, but then there are not many  fiberglass toilets I know of. With a pumice scouring stick like the  Pumie® brand made by United States Pumice Company, you simply wet the  bar and rub it back and forth on the stain. You’ll develop a pumice  paste which will assist in cleaning and polishing the surface, then  simply rinse clean.Things I haven't tried:Naval JellyTo get rust stains out of sinks and around drains, use NAVAL Jelly,  which can be found in the automotive section.
How to make the lens from my glasses stop falling out?
Try these methods:ScrewdriverUsually there is a screw at the corner of the glasses that keeps the lens tight in place, over time or by excessing movement that screw may loosen. Take some small screwdrivers, flat head or other and tighten that screw. Keep that screw tightened for better results, and carry some screwdrivers with you so that you can implement this fix anywhere. This screwdriver fix can be implemented for lenses that fell out and that you can't put back in. For glasses that you lost the screw go to small elctronics and you can usually take the screws from there, especially if they are broken. If not screws from old glasses or repair kits you can buy can help. - Taking the screw and dipping it into glue, before you stick it back in works better. But should only be done to glasses that you can longer take to the store to be fixed.To make the screw stay tight without glue:  Try taking a thin piece of cloth and screwing it in with that, that way the cloth shims it in place. Paper is said to work, but I ahven't tried.Replacing the lost screw with paperclip or wire is said to work.Water Soluble glue works to and since it is water soluble you can wash it off, before you take it to the store. Elmer's is a popualr brand.From theguardian.com here are some other methods:If the frame becomes loose... Both metal and plastic frames are designed to be reshaped while warm. Heating them gently will soften the material and allow you to bend the arms back. Place them in water the temperature of a hot bath for a minute or two. Remove the frames from the water and bend the arms gently, replacing them in the water to reheat if the frame cools and stiffens. Don't force the arms or you will risk snapping them. Instead, hold each arm lengthwise between the thumbs and forefingers of both your hands and squeeze gently, using a "bouncing" motion and moving your fingers up and down the arm to reshape it gradually.If a lens falls out... Lenses may be held in a solid plastic frame, in a metal frame held together with a small screw, or secured in a "rimless" frame using a nylon wire that sits in a groove along the edge of the lens. Metal frames can be mended with a screw or, temporarily, with wire. If a plastic frame has not broken, you can snap the lens back into place by pushing it firmly into the frame, usually from the reverse side. Putting a lens back into a rimless frame is trickier. A good tip is to pull the nylon wire around the edge of the lens using a strip of thin, non-stretchy fabric. Put the lens into the top half of the frame then use the fabric to pull the wire around the lens and into the groove.Additional InfoeHow
How to Pack Dress Shirts / Clothes for Travel
What I use is rolling it. This way is good for t-shirts, but how it affects dress shirts depends on the methods. I usually take the shirt and fold the sleeves onto the midline of the shirt and then take the rectangle and fold it again, then I roll. There is only a crease down the middle if you leave the shirt alone for a while(weeks), but by not folding the shirt down the middle that stops the crease from forming. It makes the shirt take up more surface area.The video method is a little different than my method. Folding in any fashion leaves creases everywhere, compared to this method. A tip is to place wrapping paper or other paper(even plastic) onto the fabric before you fold. This stops the fabric from sticking together and can combat creasing.Something that will helpWhat really determines the amount of wrinkling?The fabric type and weave of the shirt. How long your clothing is packed. How tightly your clothing is packed (less in the luggage the better!).Using a trusted brand of starch and storing for only a little while works the best alongside these methods.Additional Info6 Tips for Wrinkle-Free PackingeHowWikihow: But it uses a suitcase.

How can I clear my shower drain without drain cleaner?
There are multiple steps that help in this case:Next time, comb your hair before taking a shower. That is especially helpful for people with long hair. This will cause your loose hair to be in the brush instead of the drain and thus reduce clogging.When the clogging starts, stop adding water ASAP and then try to remove everything from the drain that you can reach. Hair, especially, likes to hang on various parts of the drain that can be reached by hand. If available, use a hairclip, bend it to a hook shape and clean the drain with it as much as possible.Use a "poor man's Pömpel (AKA plunger)": fill some water into the shower while keeping the drain covered with your palm. Then quickly raise your hand and smash it onto the drain opening, repeatedly. Do it fast, do it often, do it hard. That will cause the water in the drain to move back and forth and take with it any stuff that currently is stuck in the drain. Its important to apply this after #2 has been completed as throughly as possible so the clogging is not attached to something as durable as hair in the drain. (Of course, if you happen to own a Pömpel/plunger, use that.)PS: After attempting Andrew's Answer I had to open the drainage system below my shower (I was lucky to be able to do that) I found out that my shower had a build in plunger system that had been blocked by hair and dirt. Most likely even before I moved in the flat (the hair did not have a color one of the regular uses has). So, before attempting his or mine solution pay close attention to your drainage system and inspect it closely (A play dental mirror from my daughters "doctor set" was useful). Do this before it gets clogged and you are full of soap:)
How can I clear my shower drain without drain cleaner?
Long hair has this nasty habit of tangling up and causing blockages, but not enough of a blockage to completely stop the water flowing through it. It sounds like you've got this type of clog further down, I had a similar situation where the drain was clogging up no matter how much hair I removed from the plug hole. Most shower drains come with a mechanism to remove the guard from the plug, once off use a opened wire coathanger or another piece of thin and long plastic or metal to fish around in the drain to find any blockages and try and hook it out.

How can I drain the water from a saucepan of pasta without a colander?
You can add a dish towel to your lid. That way you will not loose the pasta, but the water drains out. But you will need to wash that towel after use.Depending on the sauce you are going to serve along with the pasta it is possible to make it too dry for itself and then put it into the pot with the pasta. That way you use the small remaining water in the pasta pot to dilute the too-thick-sauce until its tasty.If you twist the pot a little during the outpour of the water you can prevent the pasta from slipping out, but it takes longer to pour the water that way and if done uncarefully it could result in a gush of boiling hot water on your hands. While its possible its not recomenndable.Place a toothpick in the opening of the lid, that way the opening is not big enough for most noodles to skip past it.
How to make the lens from my glasses stop falling out?
The reason (as you most likely know) is that the glass and the frame warm and cool at different speeds thus expanding / retracting unevenly.To prevent this from happening take the glasses off when entering a warm room and hold them in your hands for a moment. You should be able to warm them sufficiently and evenly so nothing is going to happen. But this of course takes thought and a minute or so. Its only viable in narrow situations.Quick solution if it just happened:Rip some (small!) pieces of a paper-hanky and put them into the frame before placing the glass inside, the extra pressure should keep in in place for the moment. But keep in mind that this will (over time) bend your frame, so you might not want to apply this permanently.Lasting solution that takes time to construct: (I did not try this on wireframes, but on regular frames it works)You need to add something to stabilize the glass until the temperature has evened out. You write you don't want to glue stuff on your glass, this solution uses glue (or solder if you happen to have a metal frame) to the frame and should not modify the glass at all.Get some thin but sturdy metal piece (like from a paper clip) and cut in into a short pieces (I used ~5 mm but that depends on your frame). Bend it around the frame so that it sticks into the glass area for about 1 mm. Less may be sufficient but it again depends on your glasses. Now glue (or solder) it in place on the frame. You should use two of them on the lower right and lower left area of the frame (corners if available). That way your glasses can't fall out while the temperature is evening out.If you use thick cable or one with a prominent color this will look either very cool or very stupid, so you might want to use a color that matches your frame. If done correctly it is not visible except when searched for with high attention.It does not give perfect results though, if you switch temperatures and shake your head intensely your glasses could still fall out. If thats a problem apply a third wire on the center top (or one on each upper corners), but thats easier to spot.In case you are capable of producing fine craft this solution can greatly add to the look of your glasses, up to the point of making them a unique piece of art. But I would not be able to do so and thus can't give guidance on it. Ask your local goldsmith.
How can I figure out which side of the car the gas hatch is on (without getting out)?
Pretty much every car made in the last couple of decades has a gas hatch indicator arrow right on the dashboard:Just look for the arrow next to the pump icon.  I'd  seen that little triangle thousands of times and never noticed it until a friend told me it indicates the side the gas cap is on.
Is there a way to erase pencil without a standard eraser?
In the past, in the absence of an eraser, I have used Blu-tak (or another poster putty).It works a treat and many graphite artists use a putty as an eraser as standard.They call them kneaded erasers.I'm sure it will work better than the Silly Putty that you tried.
How can I drain the water from a saucepan of pasta without a colander?
With some practice, holding the lid over the pan with a slight opening for the water to drain out works well for me. The trick is to make sure the opening for the lid is smaller than the size of one noodle and to pour slowly.You can also make your own colander from some things laying around the house. In cases where the pasta isn't very hot, a plastic ziplock bag with a few small holes would work great. If the noodles are too hot for that, you could drill (or saw if you have the tools) small holes into a plastic bowl you have, even a disposable one if you have one. But that can be a good bit of work and takes a bit of planning.If you have a frying pan cover or something similar around, you could use that as a filter for the noodles.One of the best ways is to use a dishtowel, making sure you hold it very carefully so that you don't burn your hands, but pouring the noodles with water into the towel so that the water can go through but the noodles are caught in the towel. Note that this only works with unseasoned noodles. Alternatively you could manually scoop out the noodles with the proper tools to do so, i.e. a spaghetti scooper or a slotted spoon, etc. depending on the type of noodle, moving them to an alternative container or directly onto a plate or bowl.

How can I figure out which side of the car the gas hatch is on (without getting out)?
If you're in a car that doesn't have a handy indicator, you can try driving up next to a structure with plate glass windows or another reflective surface. If you angle it right, you should be able to see all of one side of your car reflected on the windows, and thereby check to see if you can find the gas door. If you can't see it, then it's probably on the other side, though you may want to do a U-Turn to confirm, especially if it's an unfamiliar car or you can't see the reflection very well.This works best in shopping centers with parking lots, so you can get up pretty close to the glass and drive slowly or stop in front of it without blocking traffic. 
Fastest way to boil water?
Perhaps you're thinking about this the wrong way. Rather boil water quickly, try to have a large quantity of boiling/hot water on hand. Get a giant thermos, you can usually find these at Asian supermarkets. They look like this:They'll hold about a gallon or more of water, depending on the model, and keep it near-boiling for quite some time. I use one at work so I can have hot tea on hand within seconds. And the water stays boiling hot for upwards of four hours.
How to neatly serve cranberry sauce?
Do exactly what you did (cut around the bottom), but then make a hole in the top of it - a screwdriver or similar should be enough to break the vacuum.
How to neatly serve cranberry sauce?
This is a product designed for the purpose, but I believe uncommon enough to many people that I can add it as an answer:It's called a Church-Key can opener, and it looks like this:It is usually used for draining liquids from a can, but I use it also on cranberry jelly jars, to let in some air. It will break the surface of the jelly unless you're careful, usually after some practice.You hook the pointy end to the lip of the can, and pull up, prying against the can lip until the point goes through the can, relieving the vacuum.Another method you can try is using a pencil to slide up the inside of the can, to let the air in, without piercing the opposite end. Usually a little shaking (lightly) can bring it from the can in one unscarred piece.
How can I quickly cool a water bottle?
Get some dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) or liquid nitrogen if you're cool. Dunk your water bottle into one of those for about 30 seconds for dry ice, 5 for liquid nitrogen. This will cool your bottle super-fast and even turn some of the water into ice. To increase the rate of heat transfer away from the bottle, cover pellets of dry ice with acetone. Acetone has a very low freezing point and can be purchased at most hardware stores.
How can I quickly cool a water bottle?
Submerge the bottle in a bucket of ice water [1]Fill a bucket with ice water and add a pinch of salt, which helps the water absorb the heat energy from the can or bottle.Wrap your bottle in a wet paper towel and put it in the freezer [2]The wet paper towel outside the bottle will utilize physics to help transfer heat energy outside the bottle more quickly.

Use a straw or coffee stirrer to break the seal.Insert the straw or stirrer along the side of the can until it reaches the bottom. The pull back on the straw or stirrer just enough so that the bottom of the can does not form a seal. Your cranberry sauce should slide right out.
How to Pack Dress Shirts / Clothes for Travel
I have tried both "normal" folding and rolling, and haven't found either of them to be that great at avoiding crumples.The problem with normal folding (e.g. folding your top in four by folding in half vertically and horizontally) is that you end up with quite a big "square" of shirt/T-shirt afterwards, which is very susceptible to crumpling unless it is kept perfectly flat. Even just having a not-quite-jam-packed case can be enough to let the clothing move around and then get crumpled.The problem with rolling, though, is that the end that you start the roll on can end up quite crumpled because it's wound quite tightly. Especially if you've got something crumpleable like linen, or a dress shirt. You can mitigate this by going very slowly and carefully, but I find it tedious.Here's a method that I've found to work much better for me. It's almost a cross between rolling and folding. I'll show you how to do it with a T-shirt first, then discuss how to adapt it to shirts in a minute.First fold both sides in to make a narrower garment. Then fold the top and bottom in to the middle. I usually allow a little space to give it "room to bend" when you make the final fold. Then simply fold those two halves together and you end up with a very nice compact garment that stacks nicely with other clothing in your bag or case. It's almost a little "brick" of clothing.For a shirt or a long-sleeved top, you have to deal with the sleeves after folding the sides in. Just fold them down parallel to the edges of the shirt:(viewed from the back of the shirt)Then continue as before.Personally I find this gives me the benefits of rolling without the downside of "start of the roll is actually lots and lots of little folds". In particular, with shirts, a lot of the early folds are along the seams of the shirt, where they are less noticeable, and then the later folds are around several layers of fabric, so the folds are less sharp.
How to heat up burritos, without the frozen middle
Not sure if this is a life-hack answer but...Just cook it at a lower power setting for a little longer. For instance rather than 3 minutes on high, try 4 minutes on medium.Or you could consider thawing the burritos first:The easiest way would be to store them in the refrigerator rather than the freezer if you expect to use the whole package within a few days. Or you could try using the thaw setting on your microwave but it usually takes several minutes, then you can cook them on the high setting as usual.
How do I fully utilize the pasty sauce on bottle with minimum wastage before discarding the bottle?
You can usually turn the bottle upside down and stand it on its lid.  So once you get to the point where there's a little remaining ketchup/mayonnaise and it won't come out, just store the bottle upside down.  After a few hours, any remaining ketchup/mayonnaise will have fallen down to the lid.  Then the next time you need ketchup/mayonnaise, you can carefully open the lid and ketchup/mayonnaise will easily come out.If for some reason the ketchup/mayonnaise doesn't fall down to the lid using this method, then I would recommend that you get a chopstick and insert that into the bottle.  It will be thin enough to fit in the thinnest bottle necks, and should be long enough for you to reach the bottom of the bottle.  Then hold the bottle almost upside down and use the chopstick to scrape the ketchup/mayonnaise from the bottom and have it fall down near the lid.
How can I figure out which side of the car the gas hatch is on (without getting out)?
Pull the fuel cap release lever under the drivers seat then look in your side mirrors.When you release the outer fuel cap it springs outwards from the car body making it visible in one of the side mirrors.EDIT: in response to Johnny's comment below - you should probably only do this while the vehicle is stationary, eg after you pull into the fuel stop.  Apparently some people have been known to confuse the hood and fuel cover release.
How can I clear my shower drain without drain cleaner?
If you have a shop-vacuum you can use it to clear drains in a pinch.You'll usually need to fashion a adapter/attachment to get the gauge of the vacuum hose to fit inside the drain. To make an adapter find a plastic bottle with a top that fits inside the drain (I find Gatorade bottles work well because they have a wider mouth). Cut the bottle in half and slide the hose from the shop vac into the bottle and secure it with duct-tape.Once you've constructed the adapter, using it is pretty self explanatory, just stick the adapter in the drain and turn the vacuum on.
How can I remove sticky residue left by a vinyl sticker from the back of my iPad?
I like to use the tape technique to remove adhesive residue:Put a piece of tape on top of the area with adhesive residue.  I like to use clear packing tape, but you could also try masking tape or perhaps even scotch tape.Use your finger nail to rub the tape against the surface to make sure it is pressed firmly against the adhesive residue.Pull off the tape quickly.  The tape should remove some of the adhesive residue.Repeat steps 1 through 3 several times.  Each time you do that, it should remove some of the residue.  After a while, you may have to use a new piece of tape because the tape will lose pulling strength as more residue becomes stuck to it.This technique can take a while to completely remove the adhesive residue, as some residues can be very stubborn.  But I like it because it doesn't involve chemicals (alcohol is a solvent and could ruin the coating on certain surface types), and there's no risk of scratching the object's surface.  It also won't leave "rub stains" that some other techniques will leave.
How to Pack Dress Shirts / Clothes for Travel
Since I discovered them, I always use "Vacuum Storage Bags" for travelling. You basically normally fold your clothes, put them in the bag, and expel the air inside (by pressing the bag or using a vacuum device).  Your clothes will stay folded in a compact way even if you move around the bags in your suitcase. No more wrinkles should appear.  The clothes will also take less room than if not using the bags, and it will be easier to organize the space in your suitcase.  With several bags you can "sort" your clothes: one bag for underwear, one for shirts, etc. You can also separate them by owner, if you share your suitcase with a family member for example when travelling.
How can I quickly cool a water bottle?
Always keep one bottle of water in the refrigerator (or freezer if you prefer a block of ice that will thaw throughout the day).  When it's time to go somewhere, swap your room temperature bottle for the cold one.Before you argue that it doesn't answer the question, remember this is LifeHacks SE not Physics SE.  This takes less than 10 minutes, doesn't require you to remove the water from the bottle, and works with Gatorade.

There's clothespin trick, but that one is almost a meme at this point.So, how about the traditional approach:Set the nail. Place the tip of the nail where you want to drive your nail and just push it in with your fingers. If the surface is too hard to push it in by hand, grip the hammer higher (near the head) and gently tap the nail till its embedded just enough to make it stand without being held.Drive the nail.Once the nail is standing without being held, hit it hard.

My LPG runs out while I am cooking, what should I do now?
Depending on what you cook, and what the wheather and sun conditions are at that time, you could try it with a makeshift solar oven. I do that sometimes when camping and the nearest place to get gas is too far away to walk hungry. All you really need is aluminum foil and sunlight.Just wrap some cardboard or similar into aluminum foil and arrange them so that they all redirect sunlight to whatever you want to cook. For keeping the heat better, put it into a box that is black from the inside and cover the open top (where you direct the sunlight into) with something transparent.Steak that way doesn't taste great, but at least it is not raw...

I speculate that wearing thicker socks will help with both the accelerated "wearing in" by stretching the shoes more and with the reduced discomfort by providing a physical barrier between your skin and the currently ill fitting shoes.If the shoes are uncomfortable because they are simply too tight (as opposed to  "hard" and abrasive around the foot hole), then thicker socks are unlikely to work.  You could get somebody else to wear them for you ;)
How can I quickly cool a water bottle?
Fill a bottle about half full and lay it on its side in the freezer with the neck tipped up just enough so that the water doesn't block it. Just before you leave take it out of the freezer and fill with water from the tap. While you're out the ice melts and cools the water. You could rotate bottles through the freezer so there's always one ready :)
How can I not hurt my fingers when using a hammer
Don't hold the nail with thumb and forefinger!Instead hold it between forefinger and middlefinger, fingernails resting on the wood.Now when you hit your fingers it won't hurt nearly as much.And like Apaul said there's no need to hit the nail very hard at first. If you do, a half-miss will make the nail shoot away and leave an ugly mark on the wood.By the way, screws may be treated in the same manner, before finishing the job with a power tool. 
How can I figure out which side of the car the gas hatch is on (without getting out)?
Most cars will have the fuel cap on the drivers side of the vehicle. in America this is on the left side of the car. Cars made in America will all follow this standard, which means Chrysler, Ford and GM will generally all be on the left side of the vehicle. In some other countries you drive on the opposite side of the road and therefore the driver is in the right side of the car, the fuel cap will then be on the right. When the cars are built for markets, such as American ones where we drive on the right side of the road, the cabin is retrofired such that the driver is placed on the left side of the vehicle but the gas cap remains on the right side of the car.This of course isnt an exact science but I have found it to hold true for most cases.TLDR; American made cars its on the left, foreign imported cars on the right.I did a bit more research on the topic and came up with this interesting bit of info https://www.quora.com/How-do-car-makers-decide-what-side-to-put-the-gas-tank-on#ld_lwqreh_45412 . Below is a quote from the website just in case it goes dead.Patterns: For single exhaust vehicles, the gas filling opening is on the opposite side of the exhaust, I've heard that this makes engineering the underbody easier: Japanese cars tend to have the exhaust on the right and American+German cars tend to have the exhaust on the left. Possible explanations for placing the filler opposite the driver include emergency fueling while pulled over. This also holds for placing the filler on the left for Japanese cars since Japan drives on the left [1].. then further downPatterns for individual automakers (with a few exceptions, not all listed):  It would be neat to see an infographic organizing this.Japanese (90%+ left): Japanese cars are consistent within their model  lines and even parent companies. The rate of exceptions is probably  under 10% of vehicles produced in a given time period. Honda/Acura: Left Toyota/Lexus: Left Nissan: Left (right: 350Z/G35 and  370Z/G37) Mazda: Left (Mazda3 right due to Ford influence) Mitsubishi:  Left Subaru: RightGerman: German automarkers tend to place the filler on the right, more  consistently than American cars.BMW: Right   Mercedes-Benz: Right  VW/Audi: RightAmerican: My knowledge of American cars is less, but they tend to be  less consistent within their model lines and as a whole. Also, the  relationship between parent companies is murkier. Ford: Right (new Mustang is left, old Mustangs are right, Probe is  left probably due to Mazda influence)   Chevrolet cars: Left.    Chevrolet Trucks/SUVs: Right  Dodge: Left (Viper is right)Korean:   Kia: Left   Hyundai: Left
How can I not hurt my fingers when using a hammer
The trick is not to hold the nail when you are swinging your hammer hard. Hold the nail and gently tap with the hammer just enough so the nail will stick in the wood without having to hold it. After that, you can drive it home.Another trick is to pre-drill the hole with a tiny drill bit before hammering it in. This should allow you to push the nail into the hole enough with your fingers before nailing it in. It will also help prevent the wood from splitting.

How can I boost my wifi range?
According to this picture the access point is on the floor, if possible place it near the ceiling and put a metal sheet or aluminium foil under it (the sheet should be bigger than the AP). Instead of metal sheet you can use alluminium cup for backing or something similar
How can I clear my shower drain without drain cleaner?
In the long run, buy a plastic or metal hair catcher. This fits over or in the drain, and has small holes or a mesh that will catch the hair. It will require frequent cleaning, but it's much easier to clean the hair catcher than the drain.Do websearch for "drain hair catcher" to find many examples. They are easy to find: try hardware stores, drug stores, and grocery stores.
How to make neat, round pancakes
Lisa Douglas (played by Eva Gabor) on Green Acres made perfectly round "hotcakes" by pouring all of the batter into a griddle and then using the coffee pot (I think) as a mold to cut out circles.  The remaining batter was used as a head gasket for the tractor.  See http://www.tvacres.com/food_menus_lisa.htm.
How to heat up burritos, without the frozen middle
Comment converted to answer by request:The traditional knowledge about microwaves heating from the inside out is and always was a marketing gag.  Using radio waves to heat water (nearly all food contains water) necessarily causes the radio waves to be absorbed by the first water that they encounter.  The "skin depth", as it's called, for 2.4GHz in water (yes, 2.4GHz, look at the sticker and compare to your WiFi router) is somewhere between 1/16 inch and 1/8 inch, depending on how much energy you think is still useful.  Beyond that is purely conduction from shell to center.How to deal with that, I'm not entirely sure because it's usually not that much of a problem for me.  I tend to overnuke stuff in a still-sealed plastic bag to try and avoid the "moonrock" effect of evaporating the water away (doesn't always work), and then I forget about it while it sits in the microwave for a while.  By the time I get around to checking it, it's either thawed naturally or evened out by conduction so that it's now edible.apaul34208's suggestion to unroll it would probably work.  Unless it's frozen.  And you'd have to roll it back up again if you want to eat it that way, which is probably not going to have the same wrapping quality as it did originally.  (I'll let you decide if that's good or bad.)
How can I "wear in" my shoes without wearing them?
I know this sounds crazy but I swear it works:  As long as there is no metal on the shoes (tips of shoelaces, ringlets around lace holes, etc.), put the shoes in the microwave for 15-20 seconds.  Then take them out and immediately put them on your feet with thick socks on and tie them as tightly as possible. Walk around until the shoes completely cool down.  This should really work them in and you can always repeat the process if you would like. Depending on the type of shoe, you may want to microwave it for longer but I would suggest trying a short length of time first than slowly add more time until it is a good comfort level for you.  This works because the shoes heat up and, by tying them very tightly while they are still warm, they form to the shape of your foot, making them more comfortable.Source: years of skateboarding and constantly trying to wear in shoes as quickly as possible.
How can I "wear in" my shoes without wearing them?
A few methods to consider:Get them wet and wear them for a few hours. Sounds counter intuitiveI know, but most leather shoes/boots are pre-shrunk so wetting andwearing will help to stretch them out and form them to your feet.I've used this method with combat boots and it seems to work well.Spraying the inside of leather shoes/boots with equal parts 1:1 waterand alcohol will soften and help to stretch the leather. This issimilar to the process used by leather workers to form the leather tobegin with so it may be worth a try.I'm not too sure about this one... I haven't tried it personally, buta few sites recommend filling a zip-lock bag half way with water andplacing it inside the shoe/boot and putting it in the freezer. Theidea is that the water will expand as it freezes and will stretch theleather.

I don't carry clothespins in my toolbox, but I DO have needlenose pliers.  Just hold the nail with them until you get it started.  Really good with small brads!
How to kill the stink in an unplugged refrigerator?
An open bowl of white vinegar works wonders to deodorize.  One of my roommates left the oven on for ten hours and roasted an entire family of mice.  Our house smelled like rotting flesh but with three well placed bowls of white vinegar the smell was gone within a day or two :)
Is there any way to fill in a hole in my shoe - so it is waterproof?
Growing up as a skateboarder I had to constantly deal with holes in my shoes. The two best ways to fill them and also make sure they are waterproof are:Shoe Goo, which is available in most places including Walmart and Amazon, easy to use, takes a few hours to set up properly and works for a long time.  Sets to a bit of a soft consistency which can make it more comfortable depending on where the hole is.Five Minute Epoxy, which is also available in most places.  This is for hardcore/huge holes.  Mix the two parts of the epoxy together and get to work as it starts to dry very quickly.  Again, like shoe goo it takes a few hours to set up and lasts a really long time.  Dries pretty hard so it is best for holes that lie mostly on the exterior of the shoes.
How can I quickly cool a water bottle?
How about the best of both worlds? Wrap the water bottle with salt-water soaked paper towel then put it in the freezer. Make sure to make as much contact between the water bottle and paper towel as possible.The absolute fastest way is (as stated by mooseman) to submerge the water bottle in an iced salt water solution. If that is unavailable, the paper towel trick is next best.
How can I prevent pen ink from smudging on my hands?
Place a barrier between yourself and the paper you are writing on. I have used paper many times to keep my hands from being inked by a fountain pen I was using. You might also consider gloves.If you happen to have a liquid white glue on hand (I usually have Elmer's nearby), you can place a light coating of glue on the parts of your hands where the ink is smudging. The glue (when dry) will act as a barrier. And it is easy to peel off your skin. While I haven't personally tried this, you could also coat your hand with wax. I would avoid waxes that pigments that could stain the paper you are writing on (e.g., a dark red wax on white paper).Another option is to use baby powder or talcum to dry the ink very quickly. This may not work well with all types of ink.
How to make the lens from my glasses stop falling out?
I used to have a set of glasses with screws that liked to come out very easily.A simple fix was to remove the screw and apply a small dab of Loctite to the threads, then put the lenses in and tighten the screws.  Once this was done, the screws did not fall out.  Locktite is not a glue, and the screws can still be removed.
How can I remove scratches from my eyeglasses?
The toothpaste method, as mentioned in your original question, may have to be repeated several times, especially if your glasses had an anti-scratch coating to begin with. [1]If your plastic lenses have a coating (like anti-reflective coating) on them, then chances are it's just the coating that's scratched. A "thick paste with baking soda and water" may work also. "[R]ub it in a circular motion across lenses with a soft cotton cloth." [2]
How can I boost my wifi range?
This isn't really a lifehack, but I can say from experience that just buying an antenna can be a great solution. Yes, it's a little pricey, but it works better than most of the things listed here (trust me, I've tried most of them).Alternatively, if you're into making stuff, you can build one very cheaply.
My pants are falling off!
My wife had a good idea, she was just making pajama pants for Christmas presents and had the same problem.Tie a piece of thread to a paper clip.Slide the paper clip into the drawstring hole.Use a strong magnet to pull the paperclip along the drawstring path from the outside.Once you've reached the other side tie the thread to the new drawstring and pull it through.
My pants are falling off!
Push the pin end of a safety pin into the string and close it. Now push the larger of the two ends of the pin into the hole. Just keep pushing the pin in as far you can and then keep bunching the fabric up around it until you simply can't. Now, hold onto pin (inside the pants) and slide the bunched up area away from the pin (if you have the pin in your right hand push left).Continue this process until the pin appears through the other hole. Now remove the pin... You are all done!I use this whenever I make drawstring bags or have to re-thread the strings in clothing.
Making a really long/tall mohawk stand
I've found that clear Elmer's School Glue Gel works well. It is non-toxic and it is water-soluble so it washes away easily enough, just have to let water run over it for a couple minutes before the glue softens enough to shampoo.Probably the best part is that you can stand a mohawk up for more than one day with it, provided that you're comfortable sleeping on your side.
How to untie a plastic bag knot with your fingers
Twist one of the handles until it becomes hard, then use it to push that handle through the knot.
How to untie a plastic bag knot with your fingers
What often works for me is: grab each "side" of the knot between thumb and  index finger of respective hands."Work" the knot by twisting it back and forward repeatedly.  i.e. counter rotate hands first one way then the other.After some time it will loosen and you can then grab a loop of the knot and pull it free.
Quick way to defrost food?
One thing that my father does to defrost things is to leave them in the sink, under running water. While he does this correctly, this comes with a few caveats from the National Center for Home Food Preservation:Thawing in cold water requires less time but more attention than  thawing in the refrigerator. This should only be used if the water is  kept cold (less than 70°F) and the food will thaw in under 2 hours.  The food must be in a leak-proof package or plastic bag. If the bag  leaks, bacteria from the air or surrounding environment could be  introduced into the food. Also, meat tissue can also absorb water like  a sponge, resulting in a watery product. As an alternative to  constantly running water, the bag of food could be submerged in cold  tap water, changing the water every 30 minutes as the food continues  to thaw.See also the USDA factsheet on thawing.....although, according to wikiHow, the fastest and easiest method of defrosting meat is by microwave; though you had already excluded that by your lack of one. Running water seems to be the fastest alternative to microwave, but it takes some more attention. :)

Something my mother uses in miniature for her spice cabinet might help you in your cupboard.My mother bought a small, plastic lazy susan with multiple shelves on it to keep spices on, and that organizes the spice cabinet quite nicely. All the spices are easy to get to, and none get stuck in the back of the cabinet.You'd probably need one that's a little bigger than my mother's, but you should be able to find one that you could buy or (if you're feeling DIYish and adventurous) you might build your own.

How to make the lens from my glasses stop falling out?
I've had good results with a different kind of glue: clear nail polish. You can use it as glue, but also to actually make your lenses bigger so they fit more tightly in the frame.Lastly, you can use a drop of nail polish on the screws to make sure they won't come loose.The biggest advantage of nail polish is that there are lots of products to remove it without damaging either your frame or lenses. Be careful though, some frames are painted and some of the paint may come off so test before you apply it to all of your glasses.

How do I prevent my shirt sleeves from twisting in the washer?
Things I try that I know work:Put them in such a way that they do not wrap around the spinning portion of the washer. This can be done by putting heavier clothing in with it or washing it by itself.Try putting your washer on a gentler setting. This can stop the washer from twisting the clothing.Pulling the sleeves inside the shirt and tying the sleeves in a bow also work.Fold them  and  tie them with something or put them in a delicates bag. This will stop the clothes from twisting because they will have absolutely no interaction with the washer.  If I am understanding your problem correctly then this comment on fluther.com will help:From the user Wildflower:It’s a matter of quality of the fabric – and is often indicated by the  price. I think low-cost logo’d shirts are more likely to do this. Some  t-shirts are made from stretched or loosely woven/knitted cotton and  it may lose it’s shape. Others are made from good quality cotton, but  not cut straight (in line with the fibers) and they may ‘warp’ too.  The best way to avoid it is to dry them flat so that you can shape  them while still wet and let them dry that way.Some shirts are very prone to wrinkles this being, because the fabric is a gentler fabric. Washing and drying by hand is a good solution. Heavier fabrics cannot twist as easily.Things that may not be a solution:My sleeves have not twisted in a long time, I think this may be because:I usually have a very full washer.There is usually something heavy in the washer and dryer with it or it is by itself. Heavy clothing seems to work.Reddit seemed to have a lot of the same ideas with additional ones. Dryer Balls. Tennis Balls work just as fine, but some people say they damage your dryer.Try shaking them out before putting them in the washer. From experience shirts are more likely to become crinkled if they are left in a ball or not totally unfolded.Don't overload the washer. But I think overloading it can stop the clothing from moving in such a way that twists them. 
What to do to keep glasses from slipping down?
One of the things you can do is actually pretty simple, but is not a permanent solution.Take the nosepieces of your glasses and gently bring them together.Once it's smaller than the length of the bridge of your nose, make sure all screws in the glasses are as tight as possible.Place the glasses on your face. The nosepiece will be a bit small.Now, push down gently (but with some force) until your glasses feel to be in place.But really, if your glasses got hit with a basketball, other things might be damaged (some glasses have springs and such that get knocked loose). Take it to your optician at your earliest convenience.You could also try a dab of Elmer's school glue. It's not too sticky or painful to get off, and it works. It does look ugly though.Alternatively, take some duck tape and tape the arms to your face. That works too.Edit to counter your edit:If you want traction to your nose, find some sandpaper. The finer stuff is better for this. Using a tiny bit of glue, glue a small square of sandpaper to each nosepiece. It should be tiny and relatively hard to notice, but it will provide some traction. And it'll give your optician a good laugh.
Tumble-drying a fitted sheet without getting other things tangled in it
You might try putting your sheets in a mesh laundry bag, like this one.This will allow the bag to get dry from the dryer, but will keep it separate from other items in the dryer.It's a little bit of a separate issue, but I know that people use mesh bags like this to wash and dry tzitzis, whose strings can get tangled in other stuff in the dryer.
Tumble-drying a fitted sheet without getting other things tangled in it
Things that will work:Dry all of your matching linens or sets together. This way you can take your sheets and put them in the pillowcase and dry them that way. This stops the sets from getting lost and tangled. There are laundry bags for delicates and such, but those may be expensive.Dry your fitted sheets by them selves this should work. But they still run the minor risk of getting tangled around each other. This is unlikely, but still may happen.Other thingsSeparate the wash. Putting heavier items in with the sheets and stop incorporating smaller items with the sheet load should end this problem.Tennis Balls and the store equivalent are suppose to stop tangling and the harder object should stop the stuff from sticking together. 
How to stop a serving spoon from falling into the food?

How to measure food without proper measuring equipment?
Things that you can use:Know equivalents. A example pic can be seen from wonderhowto.com:There are many other such examples of basic portions. Use these especially if you have never seen some of these items. While this is suppose to be for managing your food portions it can be used for measuring.Use your hands. This is especially good for measuring smaller amounts, like teaspoons and tablespoons. From sheknows.com:And for measuring the larger amounts:We girls can fit a full 1/4 cup in the palm of our hands. And with up  to 1/4 cup, we can measure anything. Need a cup of rice? Measure out  four handfuls; it’s that easy. If you need a tablespoon, teaspoon or  something similar, pay close attention the next time you measure  something. Place it in the palm of your hand before adding it to  whatever you’re cooking and notice how much space it takes up in your  hand. When you need 1 tablespoon of turmeric, simply measure out three  teaspoons in your hand.But I don't know how useful this is depending on the size of the persons hand. Many caps to food bottles are pre-measured you just have to know what it is. Like the cap to a Oil bottle might be 1 tablespoon or such.Additional Info Know from the size of the amount. You can learn to look at amounts of food measure and know their amount by measuring amounts of food and then studying the amount the size. Liquids can be measured like this as well.I find this useful when measuring with different units of measurement. Know your Cooking Measurement Equivalents.Having pre-measured ingredients stored in jars and bags can help avoid using measuring cups.Using multiple methods at once can help the accuracy.
How to stop a serving spoon from falling into the food?
We had this problem with a bucket of strawberry jam at a summer camp for kids — the spoons you were supposed to use to get the jam from the bucket would keep falling in, and would have to be fished out.  Sometimes, you might find two or three spoons at the bottom of the bucket, under the jam.  It was annoying and disgusting, not to mention unhygienic.My stop-gap solution was to duct-tape a stick to the spoon handle to make it longer.  It looked ugly but worked well enough, since the whole point of the hack was to keep that part of the spoon from falling into the jam.Eventually, we just got a longer spoon.
How can I not hurt my fingers when using a hammer
Start the nail first, ie a light tap on the nail, enough to at least have the nail support it self in the wood or what ever you are nailing into first. Then move your hand and swing away. If your having to go to the clothesline to hammer in a nail, then maybe you should put the hammer down and try a different hobby LOL, just kiddingMerry christmas.
How to stop a serving spoon from falling into the food?
There are two solutions i can think of:use a spoon thats longer than the longest diameter of your bowl/pan. This is abolutely fool-proof as it simply makes the spoon impossible to fit in. So: search for another, longer spoon or duct-tape/glue/solder something to enlarge your spoon like Ilmari Karonen suggested.use a spoon with a hook at the end like this:If you don't have one, just grab some pliers and bend the end. This probably doesn't look as dumb as solution 1 with some chopsticks duct-taped to a spoon (it isn't a 100% safe - but should be good enough).
How do I seek justice against vending machines?
Don't buy from vending machinesYou probably lost less than one dollar, so I doubt you'll go to court. However, if you still want justice...Call the vending machine companyEvery vending machine has a "For service, call (123)-456-7890" sticker. Call the number! If they won't help you, unleash the Better Business Bureau (US and Canada) on them.Or just ask a manager in the buildingAs this comment points out:there is likely [a manager or] someone in charge of handing back quarters for merchandise that didn't vend. Then the work is likely reimbursed by the vending company.

How to put a dishwasher-proof name identifier on a bone china mug?
All markers, pens, labels are remarkably non-dishwasher-resistant if we wanted them to stay with the exception of those unwanted tags and stickers that for obscure reasons won't go off.Having said that, there are a wide range of products especially designed for use on ceramics which survive many dish-washing procedures, or are even dishwasher resistant.Colors used for painting on ceramics using a brushSpecial pens or markers to label ceramicsDecals for printing on inkjet or laser printersReady made decals for use on ceramicThey all have in common that they need baking in an oven to make the colors heat- and dishwasher-resistant.So when looking for such a product confirm it was designed for use on ceramics, and it needs baking as a last step.
How to put a dishwasher-proof name identifier on a bone china mug?
Make a pressure-sensitive mug holder that beeps when someone lifts the mug off of it. Put a switch on it so that you can turn it off when you are sitting at your desk.Yes, I do have such a device on my desk. It took about two hours to make including finding the parts to use from other projects around the house. The beeping mechanism was the hardest part to find, I salvaged a children's bicycle siren for the job. One day I intend to add a mug heater to the device.
What's the simplest way to put toothpaste back in the tube?
A very good method is to use a syringe that doesn't have a needle like the one below.Image from VampireVapeYou can suck up the extra toothpaste in the syringe or you can scoop it in after taking off the top. You may have to wet the toothpaste so it is softer and easier to bend (try not to get any water in the syringe as that will contaminate the rest of the toothpaste). Then just press down and get the toothpaste go back into the tube.To clean the syringe just fill it with water and leave it overnight (or throughout the day; 3 or 4 hours should be good).
How to measure food without proper measuring equipment?
If you're willing to use one measuring instrument and accuracy is important, then you can convert all measurements to weights, using either a printed chart or a site such as this. Then weigh them on a set of scales, cheap ones are fine. It's a bit more convoluted than iliveunderawesomerock's method, but more accurate too.
What can I use in place of an allen wrench?
A few sites recommend using a flat head screw driver. Find one that fits tightly across the inside of the hex head going from corner to corner and turn it gently.Personally I would go with a Torx bit. If you have an electric drill check the bits that came with it, there's a good chance that you have some. They will work for hex bolts with a lot less slipping than a flat head.
Taking out folded paper hand towels from a dispenser using wet hands
While you're still at the sink shake any excess water off of your hands.When grabbing the paper towel use both hands.Using both hands grab the paper towel about a quarter of the way from each side.Don't pinch, grab. Try to get a hold of as much surface area as possible.Pull evenly/steadily don't yank itThis may sound kind of silly, but having had to instal and fill a few of these dispensers, many come with directions...Most of the time you shouldn't need to be this precise when grabbing a paper towel though, if your having significant problems it is very likely that whoever is refilling it is over-stuffing the dispenser. 
Taking out folded paper hand towels from a dispenser using wet hands
Try pinching your wet thumb and index fingers along parts of the paper towel that is hanging from the dispenser.  Those parts of the paper towel will become wet, but your thumb and index fingers will become drier.  Once they are dry enough, use your thumb and index finger to pull on a dry part of the paper towel, and it should come out without breaking.
What can I use in place of an allen wrench?
If I am understanding your problem correctly then you could:Make an Emergency Hex Key / Allen Wrench: This can be done by cutting the pointy writing tip off a pencil and cutting the edge down until it will fit. Pieces of wood of certain sizes can be used, as well. A plus is that the pencil can be reused afterwards. Shave the sides of the pencil down to size. Keep the peelings parallel  to the faces. Make your shavings pretty thin. Test to see if it fits.  If it's tight, that's good.Different types of screwdrivers are said to work, as well.Additional Info5 Ways to Improvise an Allen WrenchA good example for smaller allen wrench nuts, you could likely use a  set of flat-tipped tweezers, or even the flat edge on a pair of finger  nail clippers. There are numbers of bathroom items that can be used in  such cases, and again it is about being able to turn or spin this  screw, nut or bolt to get it loose.Sometimes you can use small types of flat headed screwdrivers as an  allen wrench by putting the end in the socket so that the 2 edges of  the screwdriver work as leverage in the hole to turn it. A wider  socket on the bolt or nut, use a wider flathead screwdriver. The  object here is to wedge the screwdriver into the hex of the bolt, to  create torque so it can be unscrewed.You can also find great improvised allen wrench type devices in your  kitchen cupboard or in the silverware drawers. Flat tipped and strong  pairing knives could potentially work depending on the gauge and depth  of the hex screws hole. Remember you are simply trying to wedge your  tool into the hex so that you can spin or turn it
How to get out of the public restroom with clean hands?
After a long journey through time, space, and visiting many public restrooms, I have found what I believe to be the ultimate solution!I enter the restroomI urinate into the toilet if the seat is up.

How to remove garlic smell from my mouth
Things that should work:Eat an AppleOf all the foods,  raw apple was found to be particularly effective - indeed, study  author Sheryl Barringer says this is what she reaches for after eating  garlic.  Professor Barringer, of Ohio State University’s department of  food science and technology, suggests apples may help by 'deodorising'  the enzymes in garlic.And from the same article.Now U.S. researchers have revealed which foods can help eliminate the  unpleasant odour of garlic. They say apples, lemon juice and, less  surprisingly, mint were particularly effective.How to Get Rid of Bad Breath from Onion or GarlicUse mustard - I don't know about this method. Swishing it around in your mouth is suppose to work. Take a teaspoon of mustard and swish it around your mouth for a minute  before spitting it out. Then take another half-teaspoon and swallow.  This will go down to the stomach and kill the smell throughout your  body.Eat minty foods to freshen up your breath - This is best done after brushing your teeth. Make sure you wash your tongue and floss as this will help get all odour causing particles out.Fresh parsley, mints and minty tea can all remove the odour from onion  and garlic.1 Gum with xylitol is particularly good for freshening up  your mouth.Sometimes, the smell of garlic can also seep through the pores of your  skin or linger on your clothes, so spraying yourself with  perfume/cologne is also a good idea.Cleaning your mouth and using these methods should remove the odour. Try removing the odour from your clothes and fingers as well. Drinking (milk can reduce the odour and so can Yogurt) when eating the garlic is  helpful for prevention and eating the garlic with bread or vegetables (green vegetables are suggested as the Chlorophyll is said to counteract the odour of the garlic) is suppose to help as well. Just using one of these methods will probably not work without proper oral hygiene.Sometimes the smell of the garlic persists in your mouth pores and in your body. Drinking fluids and eating other foods usually helps. For your mouth using odour removing mouthwashes or holding baking soda in your mouth for as long as you can and moving it around helps. In a lot of cases the smell is residing in your tongue, proper tongue hygiene should be done to stop it. Scrubbing your tongue with baking soda or a good toothpaste should work.Chewing the garlic less will lessen the amount of odour that needs to be cleaned.

How can I clean my sticky keyboard?
An alternative to dishwashers that worked for my keys was a clothes washer: I simply put all of them in a cloth bag and made sure that it was properly knotted and washed them with some regular 30°C programme with non-colouring laundry.If I recall correctly, the keys already came out amazingly dry. Otherwise, I suggest an extra spin cycle in another dry bag. If that’s not sufficient either, there are wind, sun and hairdryers (beware of overheating though).Obviously, this only works for the keys and possibly some other small non-electronic components. I also cannot not vouch for this to work with all materials and labellings.
How to get out of the public restroom with clean hands?
I do many of the same things that Sompuperoo does.  I'll just put my procedure here since I handle the lifting of toilet seats and flushing of toilets differently than he does.Open the door to the bathroom.  If you are concerned about having touched the door handle, then wash your hands upon entering the bathroom.If you wish to flush the toilet before using it, use your shoe to push the toilet's flush handle.  The bottom of your shoe will already be dirty, so using it to touch the toilet's flush handle isn't a big deal, and it's a lot better than using your hand.  If you wish to flush a urinal, then use the back of your hand to push the handle instead of using your fingers.If the toilet seat is up and you want it down, or vice versa, then use the side of your shoe to lower or lift the seat.  If you plan on sitting on the toilet, place a disposable toilet seat cover on top of the toilet seat.  If disposable toilet seat covers are not available, then rip off a few strips of toilet paper and place them so that they fully cover the seat.When you are done with your business, use your shoe to flush the toilet.  If you are at a urinal, use the back of your hand to flush it.Wash your hands with soap, and then dry them off with a paper towel.  If there is an air dryer instead of paper towels, you may use that.If paper towels are available, then grab one right before you leave the bathroom.  Use the paper towel to grab the door handle, so that you hand doesn't touch it.  Then use your foot to prop the door open, and then toss the paper towel into the bathroom's trash can.  Then use your foot to push the door wide open so you can walk out without touching the door with your hands.
What's the simplest way to put toothpaste back in the tube?
What I do is really simple:Squeeze the toothpaste until all air is out (you know it when toothpaste starts coming out).Keep holding the tube in that position.Place the toothpaste on the top.Release the pressure in it.If your toothpaste tube is a little used and you squeeze it out (i.e. this state), you might need to press on the sides to open up more space for the toothpaste to come in.Notice that this method works for other products other than toothpaste which come in plastic tubes.Due to their fragility and flexibility, aluminum tubes might not work with this method.
What can I use in place of an allen wrench?
Find a bolt whose head is the required size. Insert the bolt head half-way into the socket. Apply an adjustable wrench or pair of visegrips to the sticking-out half.Find a bolt whose head is the required size. Turn two nuts on and counter-tighten them (jam them together). Insert the bolt head into the socket. Apply an adjustable wrench or pair of visegrips to the appropriate nut (depending on the direction of force, choose the nut that tightens the jammed pair, not loosens them!).You can get a decent set of hex wrenches for $10 - $15; possibly much less if you wait for a sale. Save yourself time and aggravation and just get them (good tools are half the battle!).Hope that helps!
How do I remove dust from fabric lampshades?
The brush-end of a vacuum's upholstery cleaning attachment works great.  Attach it to the hose (and extension, if necessary) then starting at the top of the shade, use straight, gentle stroke all the way to the bottom rim. Turn the shade a tiny amount -- or move your body around it -- then repeat in slightly overlapping swaths until you've completed the entire diameter. 
How do I remove dust from fabric lampshades?
Similar to your suggestion of tape, but probably easier and quicker is to use a lint roller like this:A lint roller has a roll of masking tape on it, and is usually used to remove lint from clothes.  But you could also use it to remove dust from lampshades.  Just roll it on the lampshade and it will pick up the dust.  Then after the tape loses its stickiness, just tear off that piece (they are pre-cut into squares on the roll) and it will be ready to pick up lint/dust again.
How do I know how much charge a battery has left?
Measuring the voltage with a multimeter gives a perfectly fine indication of charge.  You just need to know how to convert the voltage into a useful form.For most 1.5V alkaline batteries, (voltage-1)*300 will give you the approximate percentage remaining.Same formula works for 9V alkalines, only it's voltage-6.Note this is only for alkaline.  Other battery chemistries have different formulas.Lithium batteries are more difficult to do this with, as they don't lose much voltage until near the end of their lifespan, as shown on the graph below though 2.5-2.6V is a reasonable dead/not dead cutoff.
How to quickly dry the thermals in winters without squeezing or hanging them?
Wrap the item in a dry towel for a few hours, then repeat with dry towels until its just damp enough to naturally air dry
How can I remove the bindings of this thick book?
The easiest way to take that book apart would be to cut off the tops of the staples, and then remove a few pages at a time starting with the first page and flipping them over as you remove them to keep them in the same order.In order to do this, you can try inserting the blade of a small flat screwdriver in between the first page and under the top of the staple. This should give you just enough space to snip each side of the top of the staple using a small pair of end nippers or side cutting pliers. This will just leave the sides of each staple there. As you remove the pages, you will start to expose the staple more and more, and you might eventually be able to pull the rest of it out with a pair of needle-nose pliers.
How do I remove dust from fabric lampshades?
Lampshades are very difficult to dust. They contain nooks and crannies which make it impossible to really get in there and clean them thoroughly. They are also fragile, so you can't wash them off using water, detergents, etc. Most vacuum cleaners would also damage them unless you have a soft brush attachment.One of the best ways to dust them is to use a can of compressed air. This is the same kind of compressed air used to clean out electronics, and most office supply stores carry them. Work back and forth, and up and down across the entire shade and make a couple of passes. This should remove the vast majority of dust.
What can I use in place of an allen wrench?
One way to make an improvised allen wrench is to take a plastic ballpoint pen and remove the ink cartridge and writing tip. Then you can take a lighter and gently heat the end of the pen tube with a lighter, being careful not to burn it and soften the plastic. When the plastic begins to soften, you will then insert the end of the pen into the head of the allen screw. Make sure that you push it in all the way, and then hold it there until the plastic hardens. You should only do this in a well ventilated area because the fumes are toxic. Once it has hardened, it will take the form of the screwhead and it should be a perfect allen wrench. Different types of pens will work better than others. An old Bic pen with soft nylon plastic will work the best since it won't be too brittle and break off as easy.
How do I seek justice against vending machines?
One way to help prevent losing money in a vending machine is to avoid the old style vending machines which are pre-programmed to turn a certain amount before stopping. These vending machines assume that the product will be dispensed after rotating for a certain amount of time and stop, even if it didn't vend. Newer machines have sensors in them which will tell the machine whether or not a product has dropped to the bottom. If you look carefully, these machines will have a photo eye near the bottom. If one of these machines doesn't sense that something broke the path of the photo eye, it will continue to turn the screw little by little until it senses that something passed it. These kind of machines work probably about 99% of the time, and are much less risky than an old machine.
Cleaning a dirty computer screen
Most cleaning products are way too harsh for monitors. Many cleaning agents contain chemicals such as vinegar (which is a mild acid) and alcohol. These should be avoided completely because they will damage modern screens and they can actually remove the anti-glare coating.The best way to clean a monitor is to use eyeglass cleaning wipes. They will remove the dust as well as the sticky residue left over which is caused by spilled coffee, soda, etc. These wipes are a lot like baby wipes, but they don't have any perfumes in them which would make your monitor smell like a baby's bottom. They also will not leave a residue on the screen when they dry. They are designed for eyeglasses, so they won't leave scratches or remove the anti-glare coating. They are pretty inexpensive and have the added benefit of not promoting the accumulation of dust. I use them on my monitors, and they are almost always dust free.If you don't have access to cleaning wipes, you can use a dampened cotton cloth. Be sure it is 100% cotton because synthetic fibers can scratch the screen. Gently wipe the screen with the cloth until it is clean, and use another clean/dry cloth to dry it so it doesn't leave water spots. You can try using distilled water instead of tap water. It does not have dissolved minerals like tap water and won't leave a film or water spots on the screen.
How do I fill a hot water urn that doesn't fit in the sink?
You can attach a length of garden hose to your kitchen sink using an adapter. This should allow you to fill any size container.http://www.wikihow.com/Attach-a-Garden-Hose-to-a-Kitchen-Faucet
I forgot my toothpaste and it is impossible to buy in this situation, are there any substitutes?
Chew a sugar-free gumBriefly, chewing gum removes food particles and increases saliva production. The latter helps clearing away food and bacteria and decreases the acidity of your mouth. Some gums (in particular dental gums) may also contain flourid and other stuff usually found in toothpaste. The main aspect where chewing gums fail is the mechanical cleansing of some areas, but then you still have your toothbrush for this.For sources and further reading, see in particular this Skeptics question.According to the German Wikipedia page, even sugar-containing gum can have positive effects when chewed long enough, as the sugar gets removed after a few minutes. Though I cannot find any backup for this, it makes some sense and complies with my gustatory experience.
How to heat up burritos, without the frozen middle
Put a glass of water in the microwave with the burrito. The radiation of the microwave will be spread out more, and help prevent the insides of the burrito from turning into napalm from overheating. You can also try heating it in stages. Start with the microwave on a real low power for a couple of minutes until the burrito has warmed up a little. Then cook it the rest of the way on high power.
How to make a NEW fountain pen write smoother?
I find that the best way to keep a fountain pen writing well is to do periodic maintenance.  In this case what I mean is that the nib should be completely disassembled (especially if it has any wooden parts in it) and then the metal portion (or non-porous potions if it does not disassemble completely) should be soaked in hot water with a touch of vinegar in it.  You will be amazed at how much caked on and dried up ink is actually gunked up inside of the nib.I do this once a month or so with my nibs.  I find that it often takes three or four soakings to get everything nice and clean.  After everything dries, put it back together and you'll find that the ink flows super well again!
How can I figure out which side of the car the gas hatch is on (without getting out)?
Before the little arrow, here's what I was told:If the gas gauge is on the right side of the instrument panel, then the gas cap is on the right. And vice versa - if the gas gauge is on the left side of the driver's instrument panel, then the gas cap is on the left.It held true when I would drive the occasional rental car.
Tricks for opening very tight jars
Hold the jar tightly in one hand and firmly punch it’s bottom side with your fist or wrist. You should hear a distinct sound somewhere between hissing and popping. Afterwards the jar is easier to open. Repeat, if necessary.Be sure to hold and punch the jar in such a way that you do not break your own fingers but at the same time do not lose your grip on it. As a further safety precaution, place a blanket on the back of the jar to avoid slicing your hand in the unusual event that the glass breaks.My personal guess is that this somehow briefly lifts the lid and thus allows for an adjustment of pressures. However, I remember having heard a university lecture on this which involved gases dissolved in liquids contained in the jar, but unfortunately I fail to find any publications or other sources on this.
How can I not hurt my fingers when using a hammer
Holding the hammer in the very far outer part of the handle will give you more precision (just the opposite of what many beginners do). Also using a heavier hammer will make you able to hit the nail with a lower speed and still push it through the wood -- this also means that if you miss the nail, you can stop the hammer faster (someone good at physics can probably tell you why ... in the meantime, just try it).
What is the best way to tumble-dry wet sneakers?
How can I best tumble-dry my sneakers without the noise and risk of the door opening and stopping the cycle?You don't.  A tumble dryer is not meant for shoes.  It will not dry them particularly effectively, and both the shoes and the dryer may suffer damage if you try.Instead, just set the shoes out to dry in a warm (but not too hot!) place, preferably with some air circulation.  If you happen to have a fan heater, try setting it to blow warm air over the shoes.  This does the same thing as a tumble dryer would, except that it won't also toss and bang the shoes around for no good reason.  If you don't have one, even just a plain old fan ought to help.Ideally, you should also unlace the shoes and pull the flap out to better expose the inside and let it dry.Or, possibly the most effective solution, just buy a shoe dryer made for the purpose.  It'll set you back some $20 to $40, depending on the model and where you get it from, but it's a one-time investment (well, until it breaks down, anyway, but it'll most likely outlast your shoes by a fair margin).Alternatively, some people recommend stuffing the shoes full of paper (newspaper / tissue paper / etc.).  I have a mixed feeling about this — it may indeed help to absorb moisture, but it'll also block air circulation inside the shoe.  I'd suggest just using a fan, but if you don't have one, paper might help in a pinch, at least if you change it often.  For that matter, if you're going to stuff your shoes full of something to dry them out, try dehydrated silica gel — you can buy it in several kilogram / pound bags from pet stores or supermarkets as "crystal cat litter", and it's even reusable if you heat it to dry it out.  Just fill an old (but clean and hole-free!) sock about halfway with the silica grains, tie a knot in the sock to keep the silica in, and slide your homemade desiccant bag into the shoe.  I've tried this, and it works great e.g. for drying boots while hiking.
What is the best way to tumble-dry wet sneakers?
Many clothes dryers have an optional drying rack designed for items such as shoes, etc. which aren't meant to be tumble dried. The shoes would sit in the rack inside of the dryer and can be dried without risking damage to the dryer or the shoes. It would probably work best if the shoes were put on the rack on their side or upside down. They are on the expensive side, but are worth it if you wash shoes regularly.Here is an example of one: http://www.whirlpool.com/-[W10121663]-1001500/W10121663/
How to make a NEW fountain pen write smoother?
A new fountain pen is not yet "worn in" to your personal style of writing. As you write, the nib will deform very slightly so that the tip is presented at an angle that suits your hand. The flow of ink, controlled by how far apart the two halves of the nib are, will also gradually adjust to your own style. For this to work well, you need a fountain pen with a gold nib. Other metals are too hard and will not adjust to your hand. It is also important to make sure that only one person uses the pen. A fountain pen is personal to you. Lending it to someone else will mean that it starts to adjust to their hand, and that's not good for the nib.Obviously, keeping it clean is important. Using good quality fountain pen ink helps, as it is designed to help the smooth flow of ink through your pen without clogging.
Cleaning a dirty computer screen
Never use anything wet, ever, on a flatscreen (LCD type, any kind of current or new computer screen).  What you really need to ask yourself is: What is this grime and how did it get on here?  Food and drink really need to be FAR AWAY from your computer and screen (said the IT manager).  Meanwhile let's deal with your dirty screen.IMHO, the secret to cleaning your screen properly, without making it streaky and dirtier, is the wide-base brush and a can of air.  Adding moisture just adds problems, much like chasing streaks around your windows at home with a bottle of Windex and your wipe of choice.  Avoid that by not getting started.  Use the brush regularly with a can of compressed air to get the dust and keep on top of splatter from your soda.  Take care to eat away from your screen to minimize other lovelies visiting your view. (ignore the solution spray below, focus on the BRUSH and note the length -- broad base means good pressure, not a paint brush but an effective scraping/brushing tool for chunky bits of whatever that is on there)( click for larger image )
How can I charge a single rechargeable battery?
I've never had this exact problem, but occasionally I've had to make fake batteries out of aluminum foil. This will just send the electrical signal back to the circuit and keep it running. How to make it:Use can use a battery as either a model or something to mold the aluminum foil around (I prefer the mold)Just wrap the aluminum foil around the battery and it should fit in the chargerThis method has been safe for me and the aluminum foil has lasted pretty long (I've had one for about 6  months). Just make sure to turn of the charger before removing the fake battery.
How can I charge a single rechargeable battery?
There's no (known) hack for this -- you should buy a better charger, that can charge any number of batteries at the same time; anything else probably isn't worth the effort, probably isn't safe, and could damage your batteries.  See here and here for more info on why this is so.I had this same problem (but with three-cell LED headlamps).  Finally gave up and bought a charger (LaCrosse BC-700) that would charge 1-4 batteries - and a mix of AA and AAA cells, too.  More than worth the $35-40 cost in eliminated aggravation.
How can I more quickly warm up the interior of my car during winter?
Use a piece of cardboard or Coroplast to block airflow through the radiator.  Do a search on "grille block" for details.@darthness: The only real hazard I can think of is that you forget to take it out in the summer (or if you have to climb mountains), and the engine overheats.  But that's why we have temperature gauges, and aftermarket OBDII scanners :-)I don't have pictures, and details are going to vary depending on your particular car.@yankeekilo: To a certain extent that might be true, depending on whether or not you have a thermostatically-controlled fan or not.  But I'm assuming educated drivers, who know enough not to waste gas by leaving their engine idling for long periods.
How to moisturize lips on the go?
What you could do:How to Heal Chapped Lips Without ChapStick:Stay Hydrated. The thirstier you are the drier your lips will be. Also, try to stay in rooms that aren't dry, but this is not always realistic. Never lick your lips. Licking your lips and adding other water-like items just dry your mouth out more. They work for the time that it takes them to dry out and then they are worthless.Avoid products that contain alcohol, flavours or fragrances, which can  be more drying.You can even try adding moisturiser before you go somewhere so that you can last longer without it. Whenever adding moisturiser make sure not lick your lips or don't let anything touch it, otherwise you will have to apply more often.Try not to touch your lips or mouth with anything. Keep even water bottles away from your mouth. Your mouth will dry out faster if you rub all the moisture off.Buying a candybar and rubbing that across your lips should help. The bar has less irritating salt. Candy bars with gooey centers or chocolate outsides(plain chocolate, etc) help more than hard shelled candies, like M&M's. Taking the chocolate cover to a candy bar and rubbing with that helps, but avoid bars laced with peanuts if you are allergic. Make sure to avoid bright dyes(like blue, orange, red, etc) that coat the candy and ingredients that you can't eat. Borrowing hand lotion with natural ingredients also works. Make sure they are natural and avoid things you don't know and are allergic to. Never borrow lip balm, this is severely disgusting. If you know someone you can try getting lip balm from the bottom of their stick, this way they have not used it yet.
What is the easiest way to put on a bracelet ('S-hook') pin with one hand without anyone help?
Using sellotapeYou can stick the base end of the bracelet to your wrist with a sellotape, so that it will not move and helps you to link the other end faster.Use paper clipYou can also use anything to hold it from moving. Use paper clip to hang the other end and now you can easily link the other.
De-pill the clothes?
Sellotape: Stick sellotape against the pilled fabric and peel it off.Combing: Use fine distant comb to remove the pills.Razor: Use ready made razor and remove the pills just like shaving.
Tricks for opening very tight jars
Try tightening the lid first.  I realize how that sounds, but it has worked for me on occasion.   My wife heard someone suggest that idea years ago. I was doubtful at first  but it does seem to work on some lids.   I think it just helps break the seal much like banging the lid on the edge.
cleaning grouts on the bathroom tiles without concentrated acids
Make a paste with bicarbonate of soda and half water, half lemon juice - it needs to be thick enough to stick to the grout on the vertical wall. Leave it for ten minutes, remove some and see if its worked - if not, leave the rest for longer. Its mucky, fiddly and time consuming, but it does work. Or try spray carpet cleaner - spray directly into the grout line and leave several minutes, rinse off. Alternatively, if the grout is more than 10 years old, scrape the top layer out and replace with new grout.
What is the easiest way to put on a bracelet ('S-hook') pin with one hand without anyone help?
I use a rubber band. I'll break down the process, step by step:Slip rubber band over wrist.Lay bracelet across wrist.Take a bit of the rubber band and put it over part of the bracelet -- now the bracelet will stay put while you angle yourself to hook it.If you accidentally lose track of where the rubber band is in relationship to the bracelet and the bracelet is now going through the band, just cut off the rubber band and start over with another one.
How to Get Rid of Smell in a Refrigerator?

Cleaning up a spill on a wood floor, without spreading the spill
Mop it up in a circular fashion, starting on the outside of the spill and then moving in a cricular motion to the center of the spill, always keeping your mop or towels at the edge of the water. You'll push the spill inwards and force it into whatever you are using to wipe it up.
How do I remove dust from fabric lampshades?
This may seem like an "old-fashioned" solution, but have you tried a simple feather duster?  I have a cheap one like this, and find it excellent for getting dust off lampshades. Of course, the feather duster will mostly just scatter the dust into the air, so you may want to hold a vacuum cleaner nozzle nearby to collect it.  Or just let it settle, and then vacuum the floor.
Removing stones from mud
You could try to build a sifter:Get a square meter/yard of 1/2" or 2cm wire mesh from the hardware store, "Chicken Wire" may work.Build a square frame that is a few inches smaller than your mesh.Staple the mesh to the frameThen you can shovel your mud into the sifter and give it a good shake to separate the stones.Here are some more advanced directions that include a wheelbarrow attachment/rail system if you're feeling adventurous. There seems do be an undue amount of concern about using a sifter with wet soil/mud...In my experience most mud will dry out to become, you know, just regular soil within 6-24 hrs. Soils heavy in clay will require a lot more work:You could use more water to turn the clay into a slip or slurry while passing it through a sifter.You could wait for the clay to dry completely and starts to split into mudcracks. Then you can break it up a bit with a garden hoe and shovel it into a sifter. Your sifter in this case will very likely need to be re-enforced or built with a heavier gauge wire. Hardened dry clay will still crumble when shaken and agitated over the sifter and fall through leaving the rocks behind.The soil in question doesn't appear to be terribly heavy in clay, at least judging by the color and granulation on the surface in the picture, and it doesn't appear to be terrifically wet either. It looks to be just damp topsoil, probably because it is a low lying area. Some raking/tilling/hoeing before shoveling the soil into the sifter may make for easier going with the sifter, but it shouldn't be a big deal.
Removing stones from mud
Things I have tried:Stack crates or containers with slits(any stackable containers are better, and thicker containers work better) in the bottom up on top of each other(stacking the crates or containers 3 or higher works, using 2 should work, as well). Now stick the rocks in a crate at the top of the stack and shake the whole apparatus. This works better with thinner and dry soil, so you should maybe dry the soil out, first. Raking the muddy rock soil into a pile(trying to avoid as much rocks as possible) is necessary for this step. If you shake the apparatus vigorously it doesn't matter how thick the dirt is. This is a ready made version of a soil sifter.Taking one crate and shaking the rocks with that also helps. This would be more useful for muddy dirt.  Using sieves(household ones work fine, but can be destroyed from vigorous shaking), but from experience they can gum up if you put to wet of dirt in them. This probably won't work, unless you can dry the soil out.Taking fencing(the larger the rocks the larger the fencing or metal mesh can be) and hanging it over(tying or screwing it into place) a frame. This can be wooden one. Make a dirt SifterAdditional InfoWhat techniques can be used to manually sieve stones from the soil efficiently?:This shows some pros and cons on how to better make a dirt sifter.If you didn't want to build a frame, I've seen people just throw a  section of hardware cloth over a wheelbarrow and toss material onto  it. Looks like more ongoing work though -- I think you're better off  building a frame.The sifter should be designed so that rocks come out easily -- you  don't want a fully enclosed frame, because then you have to tip it  over to dump out the rocks.Ideally the sifter will be inclined -- the  rocks will just fall out instead of you having to remove them. Decide  where you want to have the sifted soil land (e.g. wheelbarrow,  container, or the ground) and design the sifter around that  destination. For example, if you want to capture soil in your  wheelbarrow, make the frame wide enough so that it sits on the  wheelbarrow edges, tilted so that you lose the rocks between the  handles, and not so high that it will tip over your wheelbarrow.
I forgot my toothpaste and it is impossible to buy in this situation, are there any substitutes?
You don't really need toothpaste to wash your teeth.  While many types of toothpaste do have some additives (such as fluoride) that can help keep your teeth healthy in the long term, the immediate benefit of using toothpaste is mostly that it acts as a foaming agent, helping to wet your teeth and wash away the plaque more effectively than saliva alone would.The trick for washing your teeth without toothpaste is to take a sip of water before doing it.  You don't need a lot, just enough that you can tilt your head to the side you're washing to keep the teeth and bristles wet.  Obviously, try to keep your lips closed around the brush handle while doing this, so that you don't splash the water everywhere.  (This is generally considered good manners, anyway.)There are some places that can be a little tricky to wash this way, but mostly it just takes a little practice.  For the front side of the front teeth, it may help to gently suck in air while washing them, to avoid spilling the water out of your mouth.  For best results, do one quick wash, spit out the water, take another sip and do a second, more thorough pass.(One nice side effect of this method is that you can see exactly how much gunk and bacteria you're washing out of your mouth.  Having learned this trick while travelling, I nowadays like to use it even when I do have toothpaste, just to rinse out all the dirt that toothpaste alone won't get fully out of your mouth.)
How to make the lens from my glasses stop falling out?
I'm not sure whether your lenses are held in by screws, but I'm assuming they are. I know you say you don't want to use glue, but the right kind of glue will work and if you are careful it's possible to use it without damaging anything, for example by applying a tiny amount with the point of a compass.You may need to take the screws out some time, for example to clean around the rims of the lenses, so the right kind of glue is weak glue. This will stop the screws from working themselves out in the course of the usual moving around that happens when you're wearing the glasses, but it won't fix them so securely that it will be difficult to get them out with a screwdriver.There is a glue made for exactly this purpose: securing screws which may need to be taken out. It's called thread locker, subtype weak. This is what I use.(If you get an insurer to fix them, I would have thought this is what they would use too - although they might not be so bothered to use weak glue and you might have problems getting the screws out when you wanted to.)
Waking up in the morning when standard alarms fail
This is not meant to be a sarcastic answer, but some people swear by banging their head on the pillow when they go to bed, e.g. seven times if they want to wake up at 7am. I wouldn't rely on this if it was really important to wake up at a certain time, but when it isn't it's worth a try for the fun of it and there might sometimes be an effect similar to placebo going on.
Cleaning bathroom exhaust/ventilator
Take a ladder, go up and use a toothbrush. Rub for some time and then rub with wet sponge. Do this until you clean it from the outside as much as you can and then use a vacuum cleaner. I don't see very well what kind of cover is on the fan, but sometimes if you can't pull out the dust then you can try to blow it in. If your vacuum cleaner can't blow (I mean if it can't reverse the air flow) then use something else which produces air under pressure, for example a can with compressed air for cleaning computer keyboards.

Waking up in the morning when standard alarms fail
For truly hard to wake people, there are bed shakers: http://www.sonicalert.com/Sonic-Bomb-with-Super-Shaker-TM-p/sbb500ss.htmThe bed shaker portion (the part on the left hand of the photo) is put under the pillow or mattress or affixed to the bed frame. Think of the motel "magic fingers" on steroids when it alarms. It's guaranteed to wake even the dead.
How can I reduce the chlorine smell on my skin after swimming?
Chlorine smell is due to the chlorine and chloramines layered on the skin after using the pool. So removing the chlorine and chloramines contents are the solution to remove this smell. As soon as you exit from the pool, stand in the hot shower with the max temperature you can for at least 2-3 mins. Then lather with your regular natural soap for some time, allow to dry and then wash thoroughly with hot shower. This removes the maximum chlorine on your skin and then you can try out the following methods.1. Mild acid solution: This will not harm the skin. Either you can use citric acid or acetic acid. (a) Squeeze and dilute the lemon (1:4 with water) or orange (1:2 with water) and apply on your body for some time and leave it to dry. This acid will eat away the chlorine. (b) Use white vinegar for acetic acid and dilute with water, say 1:5, and apply on your body and wait for some 2-3 mins. Then take a hot shower.2. Vitamin C removes chlorine. Ascorbic acid in the vitamin C gets away the chlorine smell. You can buy vitamin C crystals from shops. Dilute with water, apply on your body, wait for some time, say 2-3, then rinse with hot water. There are vitamin C creams available on markets, same procedure after applying. These two products are not so costly.3. Minimize chlorine exposure: (a) Apply oil before entering the pool. Olive oil or coconut oil can help better. This forms a protective layer. Rinse with hot water on exit from the pool. (b) Beeswax or butter are also the other options for this method.4. Club soda also helps. Rinse the body with club soda and then take a hot shower. Technically speaking, chlorine oxidizes on skin. It chemically reacts with the surface of the skin and forms a layer of chloramines with hydrogen. Mono chloramines are more stable and do not dissipate as rapidly as free chlorine. Any antioxidant will help to release chlorine's bond to the skin. Then the chlorine easily washes away. Applying any fruits with more antioxidant will help to remove the skin. Then take a hot shower.
How to measure food without proper measuring equipment?
If you have a known weight of so many ounces or grams, you can weigh a quantity of another material, if it weighs between say 1/5 and 5 times the weight of your reference, by balancing the reference weight and the unknown weight on opposite ends of a ruler balanced on a pencil as a fulcrum.Measure the ratio between the distances of the two centres of gravity from your fulcrum, and multiply the reference weight accordingly to get your wanted weight. Finding the two distances isn't difficult - just use the ruler!
Tricks for opening very tight jars
I've had ones where I've tried everything and cannot get the lid to come off. The final solution was a large pipe-wrench. Tighten it up around the lid and give it a twist (so that the teeth grab into the lid).
How can I affix pictures/photos to a wall cleanly without damaging the paint on the wall?
Try 3m spray adhesive; the weakest kind. You can find it at home depot, etc. Or they actually make spray adhesive for photos that doesn't ruin things like the paint on the wall you've stuck it on, since it is made for photobooks where people like to stick pictures but don't necessarily want to permanently stick them. I've seen this spray adhesive at craft stores but it is usually more expensive than the 3M stuff, which I think is better quality anyways.Another option is that putty-type stuff they sell at home depot and officemax which is meant not to ruin what it is stuck on, but I don't like it because 1) it never stays stuck (for me) and 2) it only sticks the picture where you put putty- spray adhesive is applied to the entire picture and therefore the entire picture will be nicely flush with the wall.
How to Get Rid of Smell in a Refrigerator?
This article shows a lot of ideas that I use:Lemon juice. This is a also cutting a lemon in half, this removes the odour.Remove refrigerator odors with ease. Dab lemon juice on a cotton ball  or sponge and leave it in the fridge for several hours. Make sure to  toss out any malodorous items that might be causing the bad smell.Cotton Balls. These can also be used with a variety of scented oils. I don't know, about their lasting length, as I have only used them for a day or 2 to give a nice odour after something smelly was there.Sometimes the refrigerator just doesn’t smell fresh. Dampen a cotton  ball with vanilla extract and place it on a shelf. You’ll find it acts  as a deodorizer, offering its own pleasant scent.Real Extract is what I use. But the fake stuff should work.Tomato Juice. Never used it, but it is suppose to remove skunk smell.Did a power failure cause the food to spoil and become malodorous in  your fridge? Get rid of spoiled-food smells in your refrigerator and  freezer with the help of some tomato juice. After disposing of the bad  food that caused the smell, thoroughly wipe the insides of the fridge  and freezer with a sponge or washcloth doused in undiluted tomato  juice. Rinse with warm, soapy water and wipe dry. If traces of the  smell remain, repeat the procedure or substitute vinegar for the  tomato juice.How to Get Rid of Bad Smells in Your Fridge:You should always clean the things that reside in your refrigerator before putting them back in. Watching the things you put in your refrigerator also helps. Cups of vinegar and trays of baking soda also helps, but there is also:Use oats as an odor-absorber. Leave a bowl of oats out in your fridge  and this will suck in the bad smells.I've never used this, but oats are really absorbent and pleasant smelling, besides dusty.Coffee grounds and charcoal are some good odour removers. But make sure that the charcoal is safe.Let activated charcoal absorb bad odors. Similar to the coffee grounds  method, place charcoal briquettes -- do not use briquettes with  flammable additives as these are poisonous -- in a couple of shallow  bowls or on baking sheets and put them on different shelves in the  fridge. Set the refrigerator temperature to low and leave in with the  door closed for several days. The smells in question should go away  within a few days. Activated charcoal can be purchased from pet stores  or drugstores. Charcoal can be refreshed by placing in the oven at  350ºF/180C for 20 minutes.I use clay cat litter, but you may use others. This may be pricey if you don't own a animal.Use unscented chlorophyll cat litter. Spread in a shallow pan and  leave in the refrigerator until the smell disappears.This article said to unplug the refrigerator and while it is advised to unplug electric devices before cleaning them you should be fine to leave it on. I advise you greatly to consult your owners manual.These methods work only if the refrigerator is cleaned of the rotting food, mould, or other problem that caused the smell. They can take away the smell, but resolving the odour is more hygienic.sheknows.com has some helpful stages.CleanEven if you didn't have to purge the contents your fridge, this is as  good a time as any to give it a good cleaning. Use your favorite  antibacterial cleaning spray and a dishcloth or paper towels to wipe  down all the surfaces.AbsorbNext, you're going to want to put something in the refrigerator that  will absorb the smell. Baking soda is the classic choice, but ground  coffee or even tea bags are great alternatives. Leave them in open  containers in the fridge for as long as there is an odor (many people  opt to leave an open box of baking soda in the refrigerator at all  times as a preventative measure).PerfumeOnce you have the smell mostly gone, you can start to mask it just a  little with a few natural kitchen "perfumes." Rub a vanilla  extract-soaked cotton ball on the shelves for a fresh vanilla scent or  spread a few lemon slices throughout the shelves (just don't forget  about them and let them get moldy — you'll be back at square one!).And remember to wrap all the food up in airtight containers, and sealable jars and bags. This will make sure the odours doesn't affect other food, as well. If the smell persists, give it another thorough clean. That, and some  time, should be enough to rid your fridge of even the most persistent  smells. To prevent your food from absorbing the odors, be sure  everything is tightly sealed in jars or plastic containers. Ice cube  trays with covers are great if you can find them.So wear a CAP when cleaning the refrigerator. If the refrigerator is still smelly after all of this stuff, check its vents. It may have moulded or have severe water damage. Using several methods, always works better than one.Ways to prevent odoursUse airtight containers.Clean spills and messes.Watch for spoiling food and remove appropriately. Having a paper on the door of the fridge that says when food was bought, opened and its expiration date should help.Having regular maintenance. This means cleaning any pans or vents and calling someone to fix it. Adding some deodorants to the pan works amazing. Storing food properly. Cleaning a unplugged refrigerator and a plugged one are pretty much the same only the methods may be a bit less noxious.
How can I affix pictures/photos to a wall cleanly without damaging the paint on the wall?
I have had a similar situation recently, and as a renter - keeping the walls in a pristine manner is important.What I used was a removable foam mounting square, very lightly applied to the wall behind each photo.  An example is below:According to the product website:Removable foam mounting squares adhere and conform to a variety of surfaces. Ideal for adhering lightweight items such as paper and photos to textured surfaces. Can be used on wood, ceramic tile, gloss and semi-gloss painted walls, glass, and refrigeratorsAnother possible solution is poster putty, an eample is shown below:The description from the product site:Removeable and reusable. Ideal for temporary mounting applications such as photos, notes, posters and decorations. Holds up to 1 lb. Not recommended for use on flocked or loose wallpaper and on peeling or fresh paint.Another thing I have done that worked rather well, was to not stick anything to the wall at all - I had several lines of string fixed onto doorhandles (also stuck by blue-tak on high areas) and had the photos taped to the string - essentially, multiple "clothes-lines" for and of photos.One more option is to rest a corkboard, or a piece of wood against the wall (with padding where the wood makes contact with the wall) and use that to display the photos.
De-pill the clothes?
Things that can be of use:This article calls it "Hook and Fastener", but I think that it is better known as velcro.Pull the fastener straight off the fabric--it should bring most of the  pilling with it. The small hooks of the fastener strip can damage very  delicate fabrics, so use this method sparingly.This can promote fuzzing. From experience a lot of these methods are going to make the fabric fuzzy and promote pill formation in the future. Many people have this object laying around or attached to other items, it can be combed to remove fabric fibers after use.Use a Pumice Stone to Remove Fabric PillsRubbing the Pumice stone on the fabric should remove the pills, alternatively many other rough objects work  work for pill removal.Electric shavers are suppose to work as well as safety razors, but I have never tried. And duct tape from experience removes too much, so a mild tape is better. Scissors are suppose to work, but I think that the stakes are to high if you make a mistake.Brushing the pills off is suppose to work with a hard bristled brush. I have seldom used this, but I disagree about its usage. Washing clothes less and washing them in cold water are suppose to reduce pills. Also, turning the clothes on the other way and using delicates bags are suppose to work.
How can I affix pictures/photos to a wall cleanly without damaging the paint on the wall?
What's wrong with using Blu Tack, or isn't that available where you are? If the wall is painted with acrylic paint, and therefore not water permeable, blu tack won't leave grease marks on the wall either. I wouldn't recommend it on wallpaper unless it's for short periods, but on a wall painted with vinyl emulsion, acrylic or oil based paint, it will do the job well and is easily removable, with care.It's possible blu tack is the same thing as the 'poster putty' someone else has already suggested, I'm not sure.
How to make a NEW fountain pen write smoother?
You don't say whether your pen was expensive or inexpensive - I certainly used to find that, amongst the cheaper ones, you often got one that had a rough, imperfect nib and it was rough to use. If you bought an expensive pen, take it back to where you got it and exchange it - if it wasn't expensive, then I'm afraid you either need to spend more money on a better pen, or buy another cheap one and hope it's okay.
How to quickly dry the thermals in winters without squeezing or hanging them?
The reason you can't hang them is because the weight of the water, as it moves downwards, and the pegs at the top holding them up, might cause the garment to be stretched or out of shape. Equally, hand squeezing or wringing may alter the shape. After washing, take a large bath towel, lay the garment flat on the towel without over stretching it, roll the towel up with the garment inside, put the towel on a chair or the edge of the bath and sit on it all over. This will extract most of the water, leaving the article slightly damp, though if the garment was very wet initially, you may need to repeat this process with a second towel. Remove the garment and, if you can, drape it over a washing hanging rack or airer to finish drying.The drawback is, you've now got a damp bath towel to dry.
How to make a NEW fountain pen write smoother?
The image you have shown is "Hero Pen" widely used in south asia. I have used these for years. These pen's nibs are not removable from holders (It is permanent aka hooded nibs).Smoothness of the nib is actually depends on the consistent flow of ink from reservoir to nib. Fountain pens works on the principle of gravity, pressure & capillary action. Gravity - helps to flow down ink to the nib, Air pressure - Air has to go up to fill the vacuum in reservoir and capillary action needed for constant flow of ink through narrow passage. All these 3 will work properly only when the channels are clean, right from nib tip to reservoir. Cleaning the pen will remove the dirt & dried inks which causes clogging. Dip the pen in any acidic solution. (Vinegar, lime juice or conc.Orange juice). This will dilute if ink is dried in nib. (Make sure acid is clean and pure liq, So better to use distilled vinegar)Clean the reservoir and feed with vinegar solution. Fill the reservoir of the pen with vinegar by regular method how we put in the ink. Then disgorge or spill out the content.Brush the nib and feed.Clean with hot water. If the nib is too sharp, rub the nib on any abrasive surface mildly.TIPS: While buying itself we can mostly identify the smoothness by scribbling on waste paper, We will get some idea on its sharpness. Do not buy if it is too sharp. Dry ink may block the flow, So always keep the pen closed with its cap. 
Keep razor usable longer
Here's a list of things to do to insure that you get the most out of your razors:Clean out the hair and other gunk right after you use it. This will help prevent corrosion and build up of material on the blades. You can do so by running it under some water, making sure to aim the water down both sides and up the blades, and mixing in some small taps against the side of the sink to try and get out as much as you can. As  Sompuperoo commented, shaving everyday can help because longer hair is harder to get out of the razor than stubble.Dry it off well - This is probably the most important thing you can do to lengthen the length of a razor. Wet environments make the razor last a lot shorter than dry ones because it also corrodes the blade. You can dry it off pretty well with a towel, just make sure to run the razor in the reverse direction as you shave and do it well so it's completely dry.Keep it protected. There are a couple ways to do this:Put the plastic cover back on it. Simply put the little plastic cover that comes with the razor back on the blade after you've dried it of the razor. It helps keep it protected from particles in the air and a little bit more dry than it otherwise would be. Make sure the area in which it's stored is relatively dry (not humid) as that helps it corrode faster. It's easy to do this when traveling as well as opposed to the below method.Keep it submerged in a protective liquid between uses. The trick is to simply keep the razor submerged in the liquid you use between your shaves. Only use one of the following or something very similar - keeping it submerged in water or something like that is the opposite of what we're trying to do.Rubbing alcohol dissipates the water, encourages drying, and sanitizes the razor for an extra benefit (especially if you are prone to acne problems).Mineral oil works well and helps your skin when you use it as well. Grape seed or Almond oil also workBaby oil and other types can also help, though perhaps not as well. I haven't done tests to compare other oils.Dip it in alcohol then keep it submerged in oil. Some people do this to clean the blade then keep it protected in the oil of their choice.Use denim jeans to hone it. Even after doing all of the above, the razor eventually gets dull even though there is a good portion of the blade left. Simply run the razor in the reverse direction of shaving up a pant leg of the jeans a dozen to twenty times or so. This will hone the blade so that you can continue to use the razor past its designed lifespan. Shokhet commented suggesting that a leather strop or a leather belt can replace jeans if you don't have any with you. A more 
How to naturally keep bugs away?
You better find a mosquito net which has really tiny holes. I use such a net and have no problems with bugs. You can also put isolation band on the doors so that all the tiny holes on doors and windows will be closed and there will be no space for the insects to go through. Of course you have to keep your door closed except when you are going in and out.Another advice from me is to use very thick curtains during the night because the insects are attracted by the light in you room. Use an electric insects killer. This is not exactly a life hack but will help you kill the flying insects. It looks like this:
Get the rest of the mayo from the jar?
Use a rubber spatula or plate scrapper.When I worked in the restaurant business, one of them claimed that their policy of scrapping down the insides of cans and jars with a rubber spatula saved the company a million dollars a year... 
Changing a lightbulb high up without a ladder
Make a dispensable gripper!Wrap a piece of duct tape around the end of a long stick, in such a way that you get a kind of cup shape with a sticky inside. Get the idea?Convince yourself that the tape won't get pulled from the stick after you have pushed the cup onto the bulb and started unscrewing it. If in doubt, wrap some extra tape around the lower part of the cup, to fix it firmly to the end of the stick. Removing the old bulb will be easy. Mounting the new one is slightly more difficult. Use a smaller cup so the tape isn't wrapped around the bulb but only 'kisses' it.Lubricate the metal part of the bulb with a drop of oil, WD40 will do, then wipe it completely off again with a piece of soft paper or cloth. We don't want a shortcircuit! Enough lubricant will be left to make a noticable difference.I used this method several times, mostly for bulbs that were not unreachably high but unreachably deep inside an armature.

How can I keep guacamole from turning brown?
Add more lime juice to the mix (or lemon if that is what you are using), and slick the surface of the guacamole with lime (or lemon) juice. But, however are you managing to not eat all of it?!Some claim that placing the pit into guacamole prevents browning, because leaving the pit in a halved avocado does seem to be preservative. But I have not conducted a control-group experiment, so I don't vouch for that method. I might do that experiment soon though, because the results would be yummy no matter the outcome. Edit: I assumed it was obvious that cling wrap would be used, because I cover everything I store in my fridge. The experiments that others are quoting do not use cling wrap, and one implausibly air-dried the avocado perhaps to speed the browning process. It's the interaction of lime and exclusion of air that reduces browning, and it does not reduce the browning for a long time. The longest I keep guacamole is a couple of hours between preparation and dinner or a party.That said, my first take on the problem is: Just eat it. 
How to unblock a blocked drain without acids/chemicals?
A plunger may help. Use lots of water, in order not to just half-dislodge your material to have it recollect at some later, harder-to-reach place. If the plunger doesn’t help, you may need to take the trap apart and clean it, that’s the primary place for stuff to settle. Don’t worry, the hardest part is often reaching the trap, at least for the equipment used here in western Europe. Remember to place a bucket under it before loosening any connections, and test that it’s watertight after reassembling.Nothing of this is really a lifehack, though. At least with the two answers you got, this question is probably better suited for diy.SE.
How can I keep guacamole from turning brown?
I'm sorry, but I have to contradict Cathie's answer:Which acid works best to keep avocados from browning?Answer: None (of the acids tested)It's not that acid doesn't do much to help.ALL OF THE ACIDS TESTED CAUSED AVOCADOS TO BECOME MORE BROWN AND TO  BECOME BROWN FASTER THAN NO TREATMENT AT ALLSource: An answer by  Jolenealaska at cooking.SE.The pit acts as a oxygen-barrier, not as a preservative. You could use wrapping film instead.
How can I keep guacamole from turning brown?
As has been mentioned here (including a few times by me), this question has been discussed on Cooking.SE here. Since I wrote that answer, I have done further experimentation and have found that adding Vitamin C in the concentration of 100mg to 50 grams of avocado will keep the avocado green for days, even exposed to air in a normal sealed tupperware and even in the face of lemon, lime, or vinegar; all of which speed the browning of avocados. The efficacy data of Vitamin C and propanethiol S-oxide gas, caused by diced onions, will be added to that answer.EDIT I actually ended up writing a new answer after quite of back and forth about how best to handle it. So, it's a bit later than I had hoped, but it's here
How to get mice out of the ceiling
Apparently, rodents hate the smell of peppermint, so some friends of mine who have had this problem have used peppermint oil to keep mice away. While my friends just sprayed it around the house, this website has some more specific tips on using it:Put peppermint oil on cotton balls and stick them in holes, under  cabinets and any other area you fear a mouse might enter. People even  took off parts of paneling and put them inside the walls.In a less serious manner, people have told me that squirrels do not enjoy the smell of cougar urine, so I've been advised to use it in gardens to scare them away.I'd imagine that it's the same with all rodents, so that might be something you could do to keep them away. ( though for your own good, I'd say you should use as little as possible, and try to keep all that above the ceiling, and out of your room )You could also get a cat :)
How to quickly cool off a room without a fan?
Keeping cool:Main reason of feeling warm is not with the heat but with humidity. Keep a cold water bowl, may be flower pool in your room where air circulates. Also your pour the ice water in a tray and keep near the window. It sucks the heat when it evaporates. Here We can use any book or sheet for blowing air like hand fan, this makes the process fast.Turn off incandescent & Halogen lights: Switch to CFL or LED lights instead of incandescent bulbs. This is also energy saving. Use white lights instead of yellow. Always Turn off the lights when not in useClose your room door when cooking in kitchen. This will prevent hot air coming into your room. Better to use grills than stove or oven.Shut unwanted/unused rooms and keep the doors open if possible, This prevents cool air spread through unused rooms.Turn on kitchen and bathroom exhaust and open your room. This will exhaust hot air from house.Try to turn off electronics and electrical gadgets when not in use, at least during sleep time.Hot air usually circulates top and tends to go up. So keep your beds on floor.Wet the cotton towel with water and use as screen or hang on the window.Keep the door and windows opened during night time.Close the windows when it is hot outside and even before the day heats up. Instead of bringing new air, this will circulate the hot air from out and make your room warm further.Avoid using electrical items during the day or when you feel it is hot. This include ironing, laundry, dryer, hair dryer etcAvoid using hot water in bathrooms. This will create steam and increases humidity.On Long term: Install awnings strategically on top of your windows.Insulate your house.Affix cooling sticker on your window. This will reduce the heat transfer through windows. Reflective films on windows outside the rooms which are facing east and  inside the room which are facing west and south (west and north for those in the southern hemisphere).Paint outside with light color. This will keep the reflect light and prevent heat being absorbed and passing inside to your room through walls. If you are sleeping with someone on same bed. Better to keep the beds separated this will increase the air flow.
How to get mice out of the ceiling
I am not sure if it is OK for you to kill or trap the mice with easy hacks. Method 1: Bait Trap : There are many easy & cheap mouse traps available on markets. Place the food for attracting it and trap the mice.Method 2: Bucket mouse trap. Insert a dowel on a cylindrical can, Place this structure on top of a high bucket. Keep the food on the cylinder. Once mice stands on the can, it will slip fall into the bucket. If you want to kill it add any acidic solution on the bucket.Method 3: Walk the Plank. Keep food on the a think plank on top a bucket like shown below. Mice will fall down into the bucket for the weight. Method 4: Put hard glue in a sheet around its food. It will stick in the glue. Also there are available sticky sheetsMethod 5. Use peppermint oil as a repellent. Pour it out in a cloth and place it on strategic areas. Method 6: ultrasonic repellents. These small beeps to annoy and scare off mice.
How to keep sticky foods from sticking to measuring cups?
You can use cooking oil: A bit of cooking oil rubbed on the inside stops all adhering. And if  you are cooking a cake or other good, measuring dry items, then oily and then sticky allows you to use the same cup or spoon. From experience, oil and grease are easier to clean than sticky stuff (the molasses/honey or whatever).Non-stick greases also work, but are sometimes really bad for peoples health and can have nasty flavours. Doing this will increase the accuracy of the recipe, as the sticky stuff goes into the food and does not stay stuck to the measuring cup. Using the cooking object directly after the oil was applied is important for stopping adherence, as the oil as less time to drip down.Using metal measuring cups that are smooth/shiny are better than using rough ones or ones that are made from plastic; there's less surface area to stick to.
How to seal the plastic bags airtight after opening without using rubber band?

Keep razor usable longer
One trick that I've discovered is to shave with the edges, not the center of the blade.Look at an old blade and notice that the center is worn, but not the edges. Thus, any wear that you can move to the edges is essentially extending the life of the blade. Shaving with the edges is especially easy to do on the moustache, sideburns, and adams apple areas.A nice side effect of this trick is that the same areas that are easy to shave with the edges of the blade are pretty much the same areas where one desires a sharper blade, especially the adams apple.
How can I figure out which side of the car the gas hatch is on (without getting out)?
About the auto maker origin, American, Asian, European, you are partially right, the point is that Japanese drive on the left so they have the pump on the left and the Europeans drive on the right so they have the cap on the right. The exceptions came from joint ventures where the side of the cap depends on the origin of the car designer. For example: Asian designed cars like the toyota aygo that will also be also sold as the Citroën c2 in Europe. In Japan the same car branded toyota will have the wheel on the right and the cap on the left but if branded Citroën you will have the wheel on the left and the cap on the left side also as it is the same car, they just change the wheel side and sell it under different brands.
How do I know how much charge a battery has left?
You could create a simple device using an LED, a suitable resistor and some crocodile clips. Something like the following circuit: The value of the resistor could be changed depending upon the voltage battery you were attempting to test. The values you choose will depend upon the LED chosen, various utilities such as this will help you calculate the correct oneIf you are feeling adventurous you could change the resistor used using a switch. Something like the following circuit:The brightness of the LED would be an indication of charge. If this is a common problem for you then you could mount this on pretty much anything ready to use when you needed it.

How to keep sticky foods from sticking to measuring cups?
Better to use stainless steel or TEFLON coated measuring cups, instead of plastic. Traditional Method: Butter, Ghee, shortenings or oil rubbed inside the cup. Drawbacks: This will change the taste mildly. Increase fat & calorie.Cooking Spray: There are cooking spray available in market. They are clean & tidy.Drawbacks: Little costly and may be bad for health.Make own cooking spray:Needed: Any oil(olive or veg or corona)Lecithin(can buy from general health food store)Mix equal quantity of oil, lecithin and water Put the content into a spray bottle and use as and when needed on the metal measuring cups. Shortenings can be coated on top of this as optional. There is no harm of using lecithin and also it will not change the taste.
How to seal the plastic bags airtight after opening without using rubber band?
So many options:Fold and use paper clips. Folding the ends twice and using 2 paper clips will even keep chips (or crisps, for the British) fresh for several months. To get it really tight, fold the end twice, then fold the edges in, then put the paper clips on the folded edges.Fold and use tape, as aboveTry folding the bags without clipsSealing clips, like the ones mentioned by KristofferChange the container (e.g. use glass jars)These are the ones I use, as applicable. I'm sure there are a few dozen other options that will be listed shortly.
How can I fix my car key when the rubber buttons fall off
OK, I have solved my issue - I had both of the buttons still - I covered the buttons with clear tape.Would still like to have some 'hacks' in the case the buttons are lost. I almost lost them a couple of times before I put the tape on.  
How can I quickly cool a water bottle?
We used to keep a container of very strong brine (water with a lot of salt dissolved in it) in the freezer for cooling beer bottles super quickly whenever The Thirst would strike. The brine could take a bottle from room temperature to freezing (we made a few beer slushies this way) in about 15 minutes. Problem was we didn't have a lid on the container and the salt water rusted out the door of the fridge.
How can I fix my car key when the rubber buttons fall off
Use Sugru to fashion new buttons. I've made everything from phone cases to hinges for my car's sun visor from that stuff. It is holding my shoes together.The problem with the car keys is the waterproof aspect: you don't need any rain getting into the electronics as they not only unlock your door remotely, but they also (assuming that is a Renault key as it looks like) may perform an electronic authentication with the car. Sugru is waterproof, and it is flexible enough to act as a pushbutton. Since you have the old buttons, just smear some Sugru over the old buttons to create a new waterproof surface that will hold the buttons in place.
What is the least painful and most effective way to keep chest shaved?
I purchased a woman's electric wet/dry shaver, 3 Blade Foil Shaver. One of the blades is a trimmer that cuts longer hairs, the other two cut them short.I had not shaved my chest in 3 or 4 days as dry shaving with the men's rotary was just not working. I have used it 3 times now with good results.  Get in a hot shower, soap up the area to be shaved, and shave. The first time I had my glasses on, but this turned out to be unneeded.  There does not seem to be a risk of cutting your chest, and you can feel the area to see what needs more work. I did not do a side by side test, but the effectiveness of the wet foil shaver seems significantly better than the results of the dry shaving with the rotary.  I am settling into a routine of shaving my chest every other day. If I survive the next occurrence of defibrillator pads, I will update this answer as to the effectiveness of shaved hairs not being pulled.UpdateWith a chest that is shaved EKG leads attach to the skin better, they can removed without any discomfort. Defibrillator pads applied at about 24 hours after shaving cause no pain when removed or repositioned.  There is much better contact and almost no burns (4 defibrillation shocks). I wore the pads for 48 without discomfort from hairs getting pulled with each move that was experienced last time. There are some marks but it is hard to tell if they are very minor burns or just aggravated skin from wearing the pads so long. When the pads where removed I was about 72 hours our from my last shave it seemed like the hairs were just starting to get long enough to stick to the pads, but still no significant discomfort on pad removal. In summary: wet shaving with a electric shaver as described above every other day provides a nearly painless experience with defibrillator pads wear and removal. 
How can I fix my car key when the rubber buttons fall off
I ran into this problem with one of my Jeep key fobs. The rubber buttons wore out, and popped off.I fixed it by reinforcing the rubber membrane on the inside of the fob with liquid electrical tape and then super gluing the buttons onto the liquid electrical tape. I did this hack over a year ago, and it still works great.The steps I took were to open the key fob, and remove the rubber membrane from the inside of the fob. Put the plastic case aside, and tape the loose buttons in place to the membrane from the front to hold them in the proper position. Then I layered on several thin coats of the liquid electrical tape on the back of the membrane until it built up a good thickness. After that was all dry, then remove the tape and gently peel off the buttons. There should now be a perfect impression in the rubber membrane where the buttons were. User super glue and permanently glue the buttons on. Reassemble the whole fob, and it will be just like new.
How to seal the plastic bags airtight after opening without using rubber band?
You can reseal most plastic packaging by folding the plastic over and gently warming the plastic with an iron, lighter, or hair-dryer.An iron will work best because it will keep the folded edge straight while fusing the plastic together. Fold the package over.Cover the folded edge with aluminum foil, to prevent the plastic from sticking to the iron.Gently press the iron onto the edge for a few seconds until the plastic fuses.
How to seal the plastic bags airtight after opening without using rubber band?
You can use a binder clip, like this one:(image source; used with permission)They come in different sizes; for the packages you have, you might want to use slightly larger-than-average ones.In my experience, these work best when you roll up the packaging as much as you can (the packages pictured in your question don't look like they'd work so well, but other things, like large bags of chips etc) to keep out as much air as you can, and then clip your clip so that it holds all the folds shut.
Keep razor usable longer
To keep your disposable razors sharp for weeks:Shake the water out and dry it using some clothSharpen it using the inside of your underarm by pushing it in the 'wrong' direction. (This also takes away some moisture and provides corrosion protection from a little bit of skin grease).Put it away and make sure that the blades are protectedBefore using the razor make it wet and sharpen it again on the inside of your underarm (sharpening it in the wet state gives me better results, but you can leave this out).Instead of just a few shaves, you will get dozens!Reference: Article on lifehacker.com
Waking up in the morning when standard alarms fail

Removing stones from mud
I had the same problem after clearing some landscaping and trees that had died from the former owner of my house and this is what I tried and failed and what I tried and worked effectively.Keep in mind I had some holes from stumps I dug out by hand and I was also trying to level my yard out at the same time. I cleared about 200 square feet about 2 feet down consistently of rocks bigger than a quarter this way. Ineffective:Raking it out, though I ended up raking a lot of just dirt back into place too and having to pick up the rock.sPicking our rocks by hand, even by encouraging the youngkids and making it a game and providing rewards for each bucket.Power Washing the ground then raking and shoveling.Worked, but ineffective:Loading Dirt into heavy duty plastic milk crates and hosing them down.Cut out the center of a wooden pallet with a saw-all and attached two layers of metal diamond form grid/lattice bought at the hardware store. (Note a Steel Paint Can Grid may also work for smaller jobs) and then hosed it down having the dirt fall underneath it and loading leftover rocks into buckets.Note: this required me moving rocks and dirt multiple times and it clogged often and had a smaller capacity.Note: Chainlink Fence I found to be way too wide and let most rock through.Note: Chicken and Rabbit Wire was too weak with the weight of the rocks.Note: The cost of the metal lattice with how well it held up (not very well) with the weight was a big frustrating and was not the most efficient.Worked Best, though it used a lot of water.I purchased a Yard Cart with a metal lattice bottom and drop-down sides at the local hardware store like this one.Used a high-pressure nozzle initially, but sped it up by using an electric power washer with a broad spray.Loaded up the above cart with the dirt rock mixture (halfway otherwise mud doesn't wash away completely and it can get too heavy for cart and break axel which is what I did toward the end). Used cart to transport rocks to a pile across the yard. Water distributed dirt evenly.Reloaded back up and repeated. Each load taking ~5-10 minutes depending on how much grass and roots were in load.Once I developed the later method I was able to complete most of the area I was working on in several hours, the biggest issue was the mud and letting the water settle.
How to separate egg yolk from whites
I thought this was one of the two main uses of an eggcup! :-)Break the egg onto a saucer.Put the eggcup over the yolk.Pour the white off into a cup.If a bit of white is still attached to the yolk, just cut it off using the eggcup.
How to keep sticky foods from sticking to measuring cups?
The easiest way to keep sticky foods from sticking to measuring cups is not to use a measuring cup.Many recipes don't need exact quantities. With a bit of experience, you'll be able to eyeball the right quantities — and to know which ones can't be eyeballed.If the quantity isn't too large, use the spoon that you'll be using to stir. That only works for one ingredient in a mixture though.Instead of measuring by volume, measure by weight. Put the pot that you're pouring into on a scale, and pour until you reach the target weight. If your cookbook only gives volumes, keep a table of volume/weight conversions for the ingredients that you use often. There are tables and converters online for common ingredients (both of these are from the units program which you can also run on your computer).If the ingredient is sold in a transparent cylindrical container, calculate the height that you need to pour based on the volume. If the ingredient is sold in some other form of packaging, you could transfer the contents to a glass pot that you finished using and washed.As for the container that you're mixing into, if you have a choice, pour the sticky stuff into less-sticky stuff rather than the opposite. For cooking vessels that aren't non-stick, apply some grease (butter works well; apply it with a bit of paper towel).

Tricks for opening very tight jars
You can easily open tight jars lid with duct tape. DYI . I have personally tested and worked in first attempt itself. TIP: Place the jar on flat surface and hold if it contains liquid. Here are the 11 summarized ways to open the tight jars lid. 
How do I separate 2 drinking glasses that are stuck?
Method 1:Modification on what you have tried. Instead of pouring ice water, Use ice cubes or crushed ice on the top glass. Make sure entire glass is filled up. Also use candle or cigarette lighter to heat up instead of hot water for the bottom glass, Supply heat on the brim of the bottom glass. Heating will help the glass molecules to expand and rapid cooling by ice cubes helps the molucules to contract. This is more effective comparatively. Method 2:Spray water-displacing spray, WD 40 on the brim on the bottom glass and twist them. Method 3:Stick duct tape on the full upper outside circumference(around the brim) of the both the glasses in opposite direction with one another. Make sure tapes not sticking with the other glass and Cut the tape leaving length for you to pull. Pull them apart. Do it slowly. Better to pull over the cushion or bed if it is glass.You can also add drops of oil or petroleum jelly as lubrication on the brim of the bottom glass before pulling apart.TIPS: Do not stack with water or moisture, dry them before stacking. Use a paper nakpin between one another while stacking
How do I separate 2 drinking glasses that are stuck?
Blasts of compressed air, directed from a "blow nozzle" at the edge of the outer glass,will sometimes allow enough pressure into the outer glass to force the inner glass out.Face and hand protection -- goggles and gloves -- are recommended in case of possiblebreakage.  If the air compressor has an adjustable pressure regulator, begin with lowpressure, using short bursts of air: pfft -- pfft -- pfft -- pfft --  If no success, increase the pressure a bit and try again.If there is no regulator adjustment, as on some industrial house air systems, start withthe blow nozzle a foot or two away from the edge, attempting to keep the air jet aimedonly toward the outer glass.(Works well for jammed 5-gallon buckets, and no danger of broken glass.)
Cleaning bathroom exhaust/ventilator
As some of the dust may be statically clinging to the vent, perhaps use an 'air duster' to loosen the dust, such as the one below:Image sourceAs you do this, have the vacuum handy to suck up the loosened dust.
How to seal the plastic bags airtight after opening without using rubber band?
Buy a heat-sealer. Here is a cheaper example. I have used similiar models. Handy too, with any imagination. Uses PTFE strips so it does not stick to the plastic you are sealing. Adjustable heat so can be used to cut or even make weak seals that can be pulled apart by hand (at least with polyethylene - i have not tried on other plastics). I do not work for a maker of heat-sealers, or their suppliers.
How to quickly remove stains made of semen from clothes
Level 1: Soak in cold water for an hour and rub it. It will loosen the stain on the fabric. Then agitate with detergent soap /liquid on that area, rinse with cold water and dry in shadow.Level 2: If the above step fails, Rub the stained area with dishwasher soap and wash thoroughly with cold water. These are little more powerful than launders.Level 3: If you still see the mark on the fabric, add a pinch of baking soda on the stained region, rub for 20-30 secs and rinse thoroughly with cold water.Level 4: There are available enzyme cleaners at market even in food stores. This will help you out.TIPS: Seminal fluid is rich in fructose & protein(albumin). It is like other organic stain. So rinsing in hot water will coagulate the semen stain firm. It can literally make the stain permanent.Seltzer water is good option while rubbing. Pretreating with soda also helps.Adding Hydrogen Peroxide is an optional while washing. If a washing machine is used, just add one spoon. It is good bleaching agent.(Do not add too much on dark clothes)Acetic acid(vinegar), citric acid(lemon) are conventional methods but I do not recommend on colored clothes.The faster you take action, the more likely you are to achieve a result. 
Tricks for opening very tight jars
For all your lids on jars/pots/etc that you'll empty straight away and you won't be reusing, there's one simple and easy trick:Use a sharp knife/object and poke a small hole in the lidIt's the same effect as with the spoon, you're letting the air pressure equalize, but this could save you a bit of fiddling around.
How can I not burn my hands in hot water when doing dishes?
Although it's not much of a hack, rubber gloves usually do the trick for me. If you really want to crank the water temperature you can get extra thick ones, or wear two pairs. That's what I used to do when I was working as a dishpig in a restaurant. If you have an old pair that has a hole in it this is a good way to give it a second life as the inner pair.
How can I not burn my hands in hot water when doing dishes?
The dishes will get clean if you use water that's the hottest you can handle. Eventually your heat tolerance will improve also. One thing you can do is put the dishes into a sink full of super-hot water, with some grease-cutting soap, and let them soak until the water is cool enough to handle. This will break down whatever's stuck on, and make it easy to wipe off. The whole thing usually takes 20 minutes max, for me. Not a slow process.Wearing rubber gloves isn't the best temperature control, but can help keep the hot water directly off your hands, which will minimize absorption, which causes 'raisin fingers'.

How to get out of the public restroom with clean hands?
Use the public restroom just as you would use your own bathroom at home.After flushing, grab a paper towel.  If there isn't one, work the handle or wave your hands at the motion sensor or whatever.Use the towel to turn on the water and adjust the temperature to warm, then get another towel available and leave it there.Wash your hands: wet them, put soap on, work up a lather. Rub the soap all over your hands -- up to the wrists -- for 15 seconds. Then rinse off for 10 seconds.Use the towel you left hanging to partly dry your hands, then use it to get a third towel.Use the third towel to dry your hands.  If necessary, repeat step 5 & 6 until your hands are dry.If the last towel is wet, get one more towel (always use the previous towel to protect your hands from the handle of the dispenser).Use that last towel to open the door.Ideally, the wastebasket is within your reach.  Use a foot to hold the door open while you toss the towel,then leave.If the wastebasket is too far from the door, either drop the last towel on the floor(*) or carry it off to somewhere you can dispose of it.(*) Really, the building management should have the good sense to leave a wastebasket within reach.  If they don't, they probably deserve to clean up the resulting mess, but ideally you should be a good citizen: find another wastebasket on your way to wherever you're going and dispose of the paper towel there.WARNING: This isn't perfect. Paper towels themselves have about a 30% chance of having acquired pathogenic bacteria during manufacture and/or shipping.  Short of carrying your own supply of paper towels that you have subjected to UV or some other method of getting rid of bacteria without water, I'm not sure there's anything you can do about it.
How do I remove the chewing gum stuck in my shoe?
Stick the shoe into the freezer.The water on the chewing gum will freeze (I hope) and you can remove it easily.I have never tried this, but you can try it.
How do I remove the chewing gum stuck in my shoe?
Look for a little bit of dirt or sand without rocks.Step on the dirt and make sure the gum is full of dirt.This will make the gum to be more easily removed with a stick, but a small amount of residues will be left behind.If you are worried about that, just get some slippers and avoid using the shoes at home.
How can I get rid of my sneakers' stench?
I heard that sticking it into the freezer for an hour or so will help kill the bacteria. I wouldn't recommend doing so if your shoes didn't dried off completely.Warning: do not microwave your shoes!
How to get out of the public restroom with clean hands?
The other answers describe well what you can do if it's a decent bathroom, but all too often i've been in public restrooms without soap and water. (Ugh.)Solution: always carry hand-sanitizer.If the water works but the soap doesn't, i recommend first washing your hands with just water, to remove some dirt. Dry them well, and then use the hand sanitizer. (It doesn't work properly with wet hands.)If the water is out, just use the hand sanitizer. When you get back to civilization, wash your hands properly.Also, complain to the management. ;)To get out of the bathroom without touching the handle, use the paper towel trick, as mentioned in other answers.
How to clean crevices of electronics without compressed air?
Here are some methods for keyboard I use:turn it upside down and shake ituse cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol (one of these sticks for cleaning ears)use something sharp and wrap it with a piece of cloth and clean with it between the keysGenerally for computers I often use a vacuum cleaner and reduce its power to the middle (it depends how powerful is your vacuum cleaner - adjust it for your needs )  
How to clean crevices of electronics without compressed air?
I have encountered a similar problem while cleaning dust and grime off PCBs for re-soldering/repair. Usually, the dust has accumulated over time, and due to moisture which can't be removed with compressed air.Using a special ESP brush (size depends on each case), or a simple paint brush but ensuring correct ESP procedure clean surface and around/under gaps and components.A small amount of Isopropanol (Isopropyl Alcohol) can remove persistent grime.Harder cases may require a stiffer brush.This is useful for cleaning motherboards, GPUs, fans and heatsinks. If cleaning a CPU/GPU die, take care and use some Iso., both on the die and the heatsink contact. Always reapply thermal paste after. For keyboards, mice and other external peripherals, use cotton swabs with Iso. Keyboards (Desktop, mostly - laptops are difficult) can have their keys removed to clean between the key wells.
How do I remove the chewing gum stuck in my shoe?
I heard freezing the chewing gum will help to remove, but I don't like to put my dirty shoe inside the freezer in any way.Then don't put the shoe in the freezer, rather apply ice directly to the gum. Ideally use a plastic wrap or similar to stop the gum getting wet as the ice melts.
How can I not burn my hands in hot water when doing dishes?
Lots of people have mentioned rubber gloves. I agree, but I found while doing dishes in restaurant quantity, (EG, for way longer than you may be doing dishes at home), It would get a lot easier if I filled the gloves with cold/tepid water after putting my hands in, then put a hair tie around my wrists to hold most of it in. It feels a bit weird at first, and you'll splash some out the top necessitating a refill if you're doing it for long enough, but it lets you work with fresh from the tap hot water without any real concern for burning yourself.

How do I avoid wrinkles in dress pants placed on a hanger?
Option 1: Use pants hangarsNot a hack, but they make hangers designed for this. Assuming your closet is tall enough, you can just let them hang down fully without the fold. If you don't want to buy one, you can fashion one yourself out of a regular hangar and a couple clothespins. The idea is to just clip the waist to the hangar.Option 2: Duct tapeThe main reason you get a crease is because the hangar is too thin, and it's creating a fold. You can thicken it by wrapping it in something. Sure you could use cloth or something else, but duct tape is normally on hand (at least in my experience). Try to wrap it as smoothly as possible. If you can get the hangar bar to a half-inch or more diameter, you shouldn't have much of a problem with wrinkles.
How can I not burn my hands in hot water when doing dishes?
Where I live we use a dishwashing brush.The trick I use is filling the sink with hot water and dishwashing liquid and while it's filling up I put in the dishes one by one.Then I use the dishwashing brush to lift up the top dish till one side is above the water.I then grab that side of the dish with my free hand and use the brush to clean the dish, not forgetting to also clean the part you initially grabbed.I continue with the stack of dishes and by the time I'm done with the dishes the temperature of the water has decreased enough that I can safely put my hands into the water and do the rest.I never put in an entire stack of dishes, always one by one because otherwise they may stick.
How do I remove the chewing gum stuck in my shoe?
You could put your shoe into a plastic grocery bag, and put that in the freezer. Then it won't count as a 'dirty shoe'. Then, when the gum is stiff, pry it off. I use my pocketknife, but anything stiff and pointy should do fine. It may come off in more than one piece. I have a big freezer, so I used a shoebox for this once, but a plastic bag would work fine.Applying ice to the gum only works if you can make a lot of contact for a long time. Water will drip all over, so do it over an area you don't mind wiping up.I've found that peanut butter does not work that well, but you do end up with peanut butter all over your shoe. The best method I know is to put it inside something and put that into the freezer (to keep the freezer clean).
How can I keep the roll of plastic wrap from falling out of the box?
Most boxes of rolled kitchen items, like plastic wrap and aluminum foil, come with tabs on the box that you can press inwards.If you press both tabs inward, they'll be inside the cardboard tube, holding it inside the box and working like an axle to allow it to roll, so that you can pull on the plastic wrap with a pretty reasonable amount of force.sourceIf for some odd reason your box doesn't have these pre-cut tabs, you can easily take a knife or some scissors and cut them yourself.
How do I avoid wrinkles in dress pants placed on a hanger?
As already pointed out a thicker hanger is better, many dry cleaners use metal hangars but place a folded piece of card over the bottom wire to make them effectively wider.The other trick is rather than folding both legs together over the wire place one leg over the wire from one side and the other leg from the other side. This allows the trowsers to be hung a little lower as the top leg secures the bottom so you do not have to have the weight 50:50 and can align the bar at knee hight - where you tend to get a crease when walking, etc.
How do I separate multiple 5-gallon buckets efficiently?
Your third bullet point (Holding the buckets between your knees firmly, and twisting the top one.) is a good start. Do this, but drip soapy water between the buckets as you go. This will help loosen the seal and therefore break the vacuum.
How can I keep cookies from going stale as long as possible?
The cookies are going stale because of a change in moisture of the starches in the cookies. It's something along the lines of processing the moisture in the cookies to crystallize the starches, which is what leaves the cookies with that dry, hard, staleness. The solution to fix this effect, is to provide another source of moisture, so that the starch can process that moisture instead of taking it into the cookies.So what you need to do, is to provide the cookies with a source of moisture. If you place a couple slices of bread into the container with the cookies, and by some sort of magic the moisture from the bread will transfer to the cookies.I've even used this to soften cookies I accidentally over baked, making them nice and soft after a day of re-moisturizing.I don't know how long you can keep cookies fresh with this method, but I've definitely kept them for over a week by replacing the bread slices as they became stale.I have heard that apple slices will do the same thing, but I've never tried it because I don't like the idea of apples rotting in the same container as my cookies.
How do I separate multiple 5-gallon buckets efficiently?
What I would try doing is a solution mentioned in the question you linked:Hot water and ice water. Submerge the bottom glass or bowl in very hot (but not boiling) water. Fill the uppermost glass or bowl with ice water. Presto! The simultaneous expansion and contraction of the layers should unstick even the most stubborn glassware.I've tried this before with smaller buckets, and it worked. Good luck.
How to make my batteries work for a short time, one last time
You will often find that batteries will give a last little bit of juice - especially when cold - by gently warming them to body temperature - so pop them inside your clothes for ten minutes or so or rub them briskly between your hands for a short time.  Also turn them in place to ensure that the contacts are as clean as possible.
How can I keep cookies from going stale as long as possible?
I find that freezing them in an airtight container/freezer bag works great. I often pull 2-3 month old cookies out to take somewhere, and people don't even notice. They'll even ask for the recipe sometimes. Just make sure you thaw them slowly in the bag, so that they don't dry out.
How can I get rid of my sneakers' stench?
You can use baking soda to dry out the inside of the shoe and neutralize the smell. Just sprinkle a bit inside the shoe and it will work in a few hours.It's the same principle as removing odors from a fridge.You can also use the gold bond foot powder stuff that's supposed to prevent athlete's foot. It's pretty much the same thing as baking soda.This should be perfectly safe for your sneakers, but I wouldn't use it on shoes made of real leather. I think the leather might crack if it dries out too much from the powder.
How can I not burn my hands in hot water when doing dishes?
A bit off topic, but you will eliminate this problem, and the risk of scalds from too hot water in the shower, if you simply set your water heater temperature to a level that is not painfully hot.  You will also save quite a bit of energy and money by doing so.
How can I not burn my hands in hot water when doing dishes?
Got a bowl or a plastic container among your dirty dishes?Use it to make a soap solution that lathers up. Use the hottest water that feels comfortable. Don't let the tap run. Scrub a couple of dishes, pile soapy ones together, then turn the tap on to rinse them. I find this way more comfortable (and water-wise) than constantly moving my hands in a stream of hot water.The same approach, but filling the sink, is also done in commercial kitchens that don't have industrial dishwashers, with the extra step of a diluted bleach rinse.
Prevent Smelly Sponges
Wash the sponge in clean, soapy water (anti-bacterial soap is preferred) to remove any remaining food particles, and rinse it thoroughly.  Wring it out to remove most of the water. Place the sponge in the microwave on a microwave-safe plate, abnd cook it on high long enough for the remaining water to begin steaming (about 30 to 45 seconds).  This will create a 100 degree C environment in the sponge that should kill any remaining mold or bacteria.  Put the sponge in an area with adequate ventilation so that any remaining water will evaporate.This will only work for sponges that aren't already contaminated.  Don't put moldy sponges in the microwave; you don't want to be contaminating your food.
How to clean crevices of electronics without compressed air?
How about just using a drinking straw and blowing out the dust? I had pretty good luck blowing dust out of a CPU heatsink that way. Or, maybe blow up a balloon and wrap the end on a straw for more force. Breath is humid (relative humidity of human breath is 100%), so don't try this for anything that may be sensitive to moisture.Note, prolonged blowing may cause dizziness. 
Prevent Smelly Sponges
Run them through the laundry. Use the washing machine on it's longest, hottest cycle, and same with the dryer. They can be run with a load of laundry, they don't have to be alone. Do this regularly, like you would with dishcloths and such. Other things (like dishcloths) would also get smelly if they weren't run through the laundry on a regular basis.
How to clean crevices of electronics without compressed air?
I insert a large diameter drinking straw [Starbucks has them in their Computer Cleaning Section of every store);-)] into the slim angled attachment which comes with most vacuums, I then tape the straw to the outside of the attachment creating a seal. It is a simple matter then to take an ESP Brush as mentioned above and use it to brush the dust into the straw which sucks it into the vacuum cleaner. Where it goes from there I have no idea!
Prevent Smelly Sponges
Wash the sponge in hot soapy water and then submerse it in a tall plastic container filled with hot water and a small amount of bleach. Let them soak for ten minutes or so and simply rinse the sponges. Allow them to air dry and you have germ/odor free sponges once again.
Prevent Smelly Sponges
Soak them in a 50/50 white vinegar and water solution overnight after rinsing + wringing them a few times. Do this on a regular basis, or as they start to smell.
How do I separate multiple 5-gallon buckets efficiently?
As you've probably figured out by now the reason the buckets are so hard to separate is the vacuum, or negative air pressure, that forms when you're trying to pull them apart.By applying force trying to pull them apart you create more negative pressure making them even harder to pull apart.So now that we understand why this is difficult... What can we do about it?You could try to equalize the pressure by warming the buckets and the air inside, in theory this may work. As the air molecules heat up they begin to move faster and bounce against the buckets more reducing the negative pressure slightly. The down sides to this approach are obvious though, heating the buckets will also cause the plastic to expand which may make separating them more difficult and heating the buckets isn't always easy. As mentioned you could try to lubricate the buckets as you pull them apart, once again this may work, and once again it has downsides. Even though the lubricant may reduce friction it makes the vacuum problem slightly worse because you're filling the space that could have allowed air to pass through.After some experimentation I've found that rinsing the buckets with water and applying a little pressure and being patient may be the best method.More specifically:Spray down the buckets inside and out with plain water, mostly to clean them, but it may provide some small amount of lubrication.Wedge a flat head screwdriver between the top edge of one bucket and the rib of the next.Gently turn the screwdriver and wait a second for the pressure to equalize.Rotate the bucket a couple of inches and repeat steps 2 and 3After going around the bucket, you should be able to slowly pull the buckets apart.Once you have your buckets separated you can prevent them from sticking in the future by placing a piece of cardboard or folded paper between the walls of the buckets when you re-stack them.
How do I stop my earphones from getting tangled
Hold the cord in a straight lineFold it in half one or more timesPretend the cord is now one short, thick cord, and tie it in an overhand knotYou don't need to tie the knot very tightly; as long as it's not too loose, I've found this to be a rather stable configuration for all sorts of cords for my electronics.
Prevent Smelly Sponges
I keep my kitchen sponge in a small container with a mild chlorine bleach solution.  This way the sponge is always clean and germ free at all times.  I mix about 8 ounces of water with a tablespoon of bleach, just enough liquid to keep the sponge covered. Before storage, after washing the dishes, I rinse it completely to make sure no food particles are left over, wring it out to get as much liquid out as possible, then put in the container.
How to make my batteries work for a short time, one last time
I have always just dropped the batteries on the floor to get more juice out of them. I don't know why it works, but I suspect that it has something to do with the fact that the batteries rely on a physical phenomenon (chemical energy) and that a good shock mixes it up enough to get more juice out. Maybe the shock breaks crystals that have formed in the reactants?Just don't try this with lithium batteries, please!
How to unblock a blocked drain without acids/chemicals?
Kitchen drains usually have easily accessible (and hand-removable) siphons.If using a plunger (should be readily available in every household) doesn't work, the next easiest and cost-effective thing would be to open the two screws on the siphon (the S-shaped thing under the sink). Pull out what's inside the S-shaped pipe, flush it in the bathroom if you can, and screw it back in place. Be sure not to apply excessive force since siphons are usually made of quite cheap plastic. No wrench, the force that you can apply with your bare hands is enough.If the obstruction is further down, you will need an auger (which you'll have to buy or borrow), but often kitchen sinks are obstructed right in the S-shaped part.
How can I store my Christmas lights so that they don't get tangled?
If you have an empty long tube  - e.g. tube on which some time ago there was some foil, like this:You can wind your "christmas lights" on it and put in some box. If this tube is too big you can cut it or find a thinner one (on this image it is too thick :D ).
Prevent Smelly Sponges
I used to have this problem all the time and it annoyed me. However I started propping up my sponges on the rim of their dish, instead of just plopping them in the middle of the dish, and now they last a lot longer without smelling. This way it dries out really well.The dish I use is just a high-walled plastic container that sits next to the sink. Basically, I'm talking about a cheaper version of your number 3, propping up the sponge to store it. If that's not working for you then that's just not working in this case, but perhaps it dries out even better when kept apart from everything else, rather than tucked tightly into an organizer.Plus I always rinse off the sponge after using it, at least until there's no visible food particles or grease on it.
How to unblock a blocked drain without acids/chemicals?
Use a plumber's snake. It works like a toilet auger but it's much longer. I've used one to unclog toilets and shower drains. It should work too for your kitchen drain.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumber%27s_snake
How can I store my Christmas lights so that they don't get tangled?
Wrap them around a cardboard egg carton.The type for 2.5 dozen eggs works even betterI just took that picture. It has 3 strands of 100 lights apiece rolled around it. I then put  the carton inside a cardboard box for storage.
Keep from Wearing Holes in the Toes of My Dress Socks
What I would do is wear 2 two slightly thinner pairs of socks. The reason this works:Friction between the shoe and the sock is the cause for the "holey" socks.  If you wear two pairs of socks, the thickness of them combined will add extra "cushion", which will reduce friction.  The remaining friction is not a problem because only the outside sock will be slightly worn, while the inside sock will remain protected by the outside sock.
How to unblock a blocked drain without acids/chemicals?
If it is still full, snakes or the auger will work. If it drains over time, I highly recommend using baking soda + vinegar. Throw baking soda into the drain, pouring some hot water over it and wait about ten minutes. Then follow the soda with vinegar. After the reaction, toss water down it again. Repeat where necessary--it's frequently worked for me, on toilets as well, and is biodegradable so it won't harm ecosystems.
How can I not burn my hands in hot water when doing dishes?
This is really more of a general water-, detergent- and space-saving solution for doing dishes by hand in a single-tub sink, but it solves this particular problem too as a side effect:Get a spray bottle and a sponge.  Fill the spray bottle with water and mix in a small amount of detergent.  (Most dishwashing detergents sold today are labeled as "concentrated".  You really don't need much.)  Follow this workflow:If the dishes have a lot of leftover food or other gunk stuck on them, rinse most of it off first.  Use a brush for this.  For really difficult cases (say, burnt and dried oatmeal stuck in a kettle), try soaking.  If you're just washing coffee cups or something like that, you can skip this step.Pick up the dishes one at a time.  Spray some detergent mix onto the item you're washing (you can do this in advance to let it soak a bit) and rub it on with the sponge.  This will take off most food stains, including some (like old coffee stains) that are difficult to remove otherwise.  Make sure to wash the whole surface, including the outside of the lip for cups and glasses, and clean the sponge under running water if it gets too dirty.Rinse the detergent and rubbed-off dirt off the dishes.  You can do this one at a time, immediately after washing, or you can stack them up and do a bunch at once.  This is also the step where, if you like, you can use hot water to kill off any remaining germs (although detergent is really a pretty fair germicide all on its own).The trick here is that you don't really need to use any water, hot or cold, for the main washing step, except for what's in the detergent mix.  (Well, you do need some for cleaning the sponge, but not much, and it doesn't need to be hot.)If you're used to washing your dishes in a big tub of hot water, it may not sound like this method could possibly work, but give it a try — it really does.The main weakness is that the spray-and-sponge method deals well with things like grease, coffee and lip stains on cups, but not so well with things like thick coatings of starchy sauce.  For those, you really need the initial pre-rinse step.If you insist on using hot water for the final rinse (which might make sense, if you're, say, doing this in a shared kitchen, and there's a stomach bug going around), one way to avoid getting your hands in it is to put the dishes in the sink, pour the hot water over them, and then drain it by pulling the plug.  Or just use rubber gloves.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
A way I usually use is: catch the fly, then throw it out the window (or a door. Or into a spider's web. Or smash it against the floor, if you feel particularly angry).To catch the fly, I use method 2 (of part two) described here.That is:Wait for the fly to land on a flat surfacePosition your hand 20-100 cm away, along the surface; make sure there is clear space for a swing towards the fly and beyondSwing your hand quckly so it passes 1-5 cm above the fly; make sure to make a grabbing motion with your fingers at the right placeThere is a good chance the fly will feel your approaching hand and decide to fly away; however, it will take off vertically at first, so it will actually fly into your grasp. This method is quick enough so your reaction time is not a factor: you don't have to react to anything. So only your muscles limit your speed, and they seem to accelerate faster than flies can do.The distances I specified vary widely; they depend on the type of the fly, its mood and (maybe most of all) ambient temperature. When it's cold, you might want to make your swing deliberately slow, so the fly has time to try to escape.
How do I fill a hot water urn that doesn't fit in the sink?
These are all great answers. I've also used a plain ol' baking tray that was not as wide as the bucket I was trying to fill up. Hook one of the lips of the baking tray under the faucet, and hang the tray over the edge so there's enough force from the other side of the tray trying to fall, to keep the water from splattering too much from out of the faucet. The advantage that this technique has over the styrofoam cups technique, I think, is that the tray will be much sturdier, and thus be able to take more force, and perhaps perform better under hot water, over a long period of time (depending on your bucket size, and how many times you need to refill it).
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
There is always the use of chopsticks to catch the fly. @darthnesscoveredthesky mentions chopsticks in his set up, and these are great as tools themselves as well. The problem, as pointed out by @starsplusplus, is air resistance. Chopsticks could be used as a useful tool with minimal air resistance.
Clean hair from vacuum brush
Honestly I usually just use a razor blade for this sort of thing, but if you're concerned about safety and/or damaging the agitators you may want to try a Seam RipperIt is a tool that is designed for carefully splitting seams and removing thread/stitching when sewing.It works well for removing hair and carpet fibers from vacuums because it allows you to "hook" the fibers/hair and cut them loose in a single motion without dragging a sharp edge on the agitator. In case it isn't obvious in the image, the cutting edge is located on the curve between the two points.
How can I keep cables from falling off of desks when unplugged?
Here's the strategy I've been using so far:Get a large bulldog clip and clip it onto the desk edge. Pull one of the silver arms up, slip your cable through the larger gap in the middle towards the main clip body, and flip the silver arm back down; voilà, instant cable retractors!Caveat: You might not be able to find a bulldog clip large enough if your desk does not have a thin protrusion around the edges (or it'd be so large that the cable would slip down through anyway).

How can I store my Christmas lights so that they don't get tangled?
I'm a big fan of using a hose reel to store lights.  These tend to keep the strings untangled and the bulbs semi-protected.  Just be sure to put no more than 3 - 6 strands on any one reel, and be consistent in the direction of the plug.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
One thing that I find works with just about any insect is a soap spray. How stuff works recommends 1 to 2 tablespoons liquid soap per quart of water, but I kind of just wing it.I usually get a trigger-sprayer (like the kind Windex and other cleaners use only I buy them empty), dump some water and soap into it and shoot whatever insect needs taking out.The main drawback is that it's a liquid so you only want to use it where that won't be a problem (also, it will sometimes ground the flies but not immediately kill them so you might need to squish them after the fact with a paper towel or something if you didn't use enough soap).An advantage of the sprayer is you can fiddle with the stream -- use a wider spray to ground the fly without needing to be too accurate then move to a narrower stream once it's stuck on the floor to increase the amount of soap you're sending to it. Additionally, you are spraying soap so you can clean and kill at the same time.I have found that this approach (soap sprays) works on just about any insect - flies, cockroaches, centipedes, cabbage worms, etc. so it is a good tool to have in your arsenal in general.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
I have an eco-friendly way to get rid of flies, without the need to actually kill them (you can if you want).Wait for the fly to land on a surfaceClosely approach the flyAbout 5-10cm above the fly quickly clap* your hands togetherWash hands to clean off fly guts! ;)*If you curl your hands to create a little bowl, you won't kill the fly and just trap it, which also leaves no mess on your hands and you can let the fly live another day. Or you could just throw it into a spiders web and watch it get eaten alive ... Whatever floats your boat!
How can I clean a vase that I can't reach inside?
A good trick specific for wine vase (carafe), but that may also help for some other cases:You can just use Coarse salt (gros sel) and a bit of water : put a small spoonfull of coarse salt in the vase, add some water (not too much, just enough to almost cover the salt) , and shake the bottle quickly using for example a circle movement (extend your arm and rotate your wrists, making the salt in the bottom of the bottle to quickly move around the vase) : it will scrub gently the deposits. Then just rinse the bottle out afterward, check if anything remains (and do it again if there was some).
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
I just roll up a piece of cloth (shirt, towel, scarf) and start swinging it around. It is basically like a flyswatter but much more effective
Is there a way I can take a macro picture without a macro lens?
You can buy "inexpensive" extension tubes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_tube) (for the price, ymmv... the ones corresponding to your camera's make will be more expensive than generic ones, but will also allow the electronics to pass through, which is actually not that useful as the focusing will likely be impossible using auto-focus, and you'll most likely have to resort to manual focusing anyway):they can fit whatever lens(es) you have, as they simply "extend" your camera's attachment (of course, you need to buy ones that fit on your camera!)they can stack on top of each other, allowing for several changes in the focusing distance and the depth of field. I recommend trying at first with the smaller one, usually more than enough to get the result you want.They change a lot the way the lens(es) focus, usually making wonders by allowing you to be 1cm close to your fingertip and have it fill a big part of the picture, and have the fingerprints clearly visible. They are tricky to use at first, but you'll get the hang of it after a while (and having a set of 3 different stackable extension tubes allow several variations of focusing distance and depth of field)
How do I put protective screens on, without getting air bubbles?
The best way to do it would be in a vacuum, but you probably don't have that. The second best thing is to put it on slowly, and then use a paint roller to squeeze out the bubbles.You could also use the instructions here:Take the stock screen protector off the iPhone.Do not bend the new screen protector.Put scotch tape nearby.The screen protector is labeled 1 and 2. The side that has 1 on it will be peeled first.Side 2 will be peeled after you have laid side 1 on the phone.Grab a piece of tape.Use the sticky side of the tape to pick up any dust particles that could cause bubbles under the screen protector.Make sure to get every bit. Take your time on it.Once clean, start peeling side 1.Align the blue lines with the lcd screen of the iPhone. Lay it down slowly and carefully.Allow it to lay down on its own. Do not use a credit card as it will scratch the screen protector.There may be a few air bubbles. Don't worry though!You can smooth out the bigger bubbles with your fingers.Don't peel side 2 yet. Use a piece of tape to re-align the screen protector in case it didn't get placed right the first time.Keep aligning it until you get it right.Once it is laid down, remove the piece of tape.Now, peel side 2.You will probably see a few bubbles here and there.Take a cleaning cloth and slowly push them to the edge of the phone.If any dust particles are visible under the protector, use a piece of tape to lift the screen protector and take another one to  grab the piece of dust that got stuck.Work the last few bubbles out...  Check it under a light.You're done!
How can I keep cables from falling off of desks when unplugged?
I put one of those beanbag wrist-rests on the edge of my desk, and then snake power cords under that. I happened to have a spare ergonomic wrist-rest lying around, and this method hits all three of your bonus points.
How to clean crevices of electronics without compressed air?
Instead of expensive cans of air, I use the blow gun on my cheap ($50-on-sale) 1-gallon compressor. There is a slight chance of water droplets forming, but it won't be as bad as human breath or the stuff that often falls into keyboards.For larger-scale cleaning, I use my electric leaf blower. I take my desktop computer outdoors once a year, open up the case, and blast away! This works well on furnace filters, too.
How to clean eyeglasses if no cleaning cloth or cleaning spray is available?
In a hurry: Run them under the hot-water tap, then shake dry.More thorough: Run under warm water then massage with a dab of dish liquid (not soap) and rinse well. Polish with a clean cotton tea towel, i.e. one fresh from the cupboard, not one hanging around in the kitchen.My Dad's method: As above, but with clean boxer shorts, fresh from the underwear drawer.
How can I store my Christmas lights so that they don't get tangled?
We bag each string in a 1-gallon (approximately 4 litre) Zip-Lock storage bag.   There's still some tangling, but you only have one string at a time to deal with.   Additionally, we number each string, using a Sharpie, on the side of the plug and number the bag to match.   Spare bulbs stay in the bag, making it easier to find the right spares for the string.We also leave notes on the bag - when the string was first used, if there were more than one or two bulbs replaced, etc., that help us decide when to retire a string.
How to prevent mildew in the shower?
Generously spray white vinegar on the walls at night and rinse it down the next morning.Reference: http://www.ehow.com/how_5948342_eliminate-mildew-vinegar.html
How to prevent mildew in the shower?
What you can use:Bleach or Vinegar. Making a bleach or vinegar solution that should be sprayed across the walls and curtains.To make a natural cleaning solution, mix together 1 part warm water  and 1 part distilled white vinegar and pour the mixture into a spray  bottle.You can substitute bleach for vinegar; however, you will be required  to properly ventilate your bathroom after using the bleach mixture to  prevent adverse health effects from the toxic fumes.Never mix Bleach with other cleaning products unless you know what your doing, this can result in maiming or death. Bleach can be strong, vinegar works fine. White vinegar is best and other vinegars can be to sugary and cause other problems. Alos, white vinegar is stronger. Spraying mixtures of peperminty or tea tree oil essential oils work for me and leave a fabulous smell.Here is a recipe that uses vinegar. Here:The problem is that many people write to me saying that they hate the  smell of vinegar. What to do? I’ve been experimenting with adding a  few drops of essential oil to straight white distilled vinegar and the  results for smell are remarkable and unexpected. The essential oils  seem to mellow out the bite of the smell of vinegar, leaving a vibrant  essence that is mostly the smell of the essential oil with a bit of a  sharp almost resinous touch, which would be the transformed vinegar.Hydrogen Peroxide also works but may have to be applied more often. This product is known to rid mould, as well. Other things that work:Cleaning the fans in the bathroom. Drying the bathroom, curtains and other wet objects after leaving the bathroom. Good ventilation is key. Things to do to prevent Mildew.

How do I remove hairs from a caster wheel on a roller chair?
Turn the chair upside down on a desk or on the floor.Use small scrub or tooth brush or mascara brush/wand, and clean the caster with soap water or alcohol. This will remove dusts and keep only hairs and threads that got tangled. Level 1: Remove the visible hairs using butter knife on the crevice of the caster on both sides. Kitchen Tweezers are very helpful here.Level 2: Use nail clipper/cutter's bottle opener. It will have pointed curve. Insert it into the fissure, Catch the hairs and pluck off the hairs. Keep revolving & rotating the caster strategically by other hand while doing this and this will help the tool to catch more hairs. Level 3: Simply cut a section of duct tape and then stick around the cover and pluck off. You can also cut a section of duct tape and fold it back around your razor knife so that it will be like a closed loop ready to stick, then insert it under the wheel cover and pluck off. Reason why Razor knife is because they are very thin.TIPS: Do not use sharp knives including razor knife. It will cut the hairs and make it difficult. But if the hairs are very stubborn and likely to tangled like a closed loop, cut the hairs with small manicure scissors or razor blade to break the closed loop. If you are not satisfied after trying the mentioned workarounds, then I would recommend you to get a screw driver and remove the caster from the chair, then wash on the soap water and apply lubricants. The example sample images are taken from Google search
How can I store my Christmas lights so that they don't get tangled?
I actually store them in a similar way to what is pictured. I roll each strand into a ball, with the male power plug on the outside and the female power plug at the center of the ball.This makes it easier to place the strands on the tree the following year, as I simply plug the ball in and unroll it around the tree. Since the strands are fairly tightly bound up in the ball, they do not tangle with themselves or each other. It also does not take up a lot of storage space.I find the spherical nature of the ball makes it easier to roll/unroll the lights, as you don't need to worry about the lights falling off the edge of a cylindrical tube or taking up extra space with a the side guards of a reel.
How do I remove postal stamps neatly from envelopes?
METHOD 1 - MicrowavePlace couple of drops of water on the stamp along with the envelope and heat it with microwave for 30-45 secs. Stamp will come off from its paper.Do not overheat the it as the stamp will become curledMETHOD 2 - Soaking: Cut the section of envelope along with stamp without damaging it. Trim off any excess paper. Put it in the cup of cold water with stamp facing upward. Stamp will float on the water. This is being done to wet the back paper and adhesive and also to avoid the risk of colors running off. Depending on the thickness of the paper and adhesive used, soaking time may vary. Usually around 10 mins for thin paper and up to 1 hour for thick paper and cards. Dry it with paper towel or few mins on sun light. 
How can I charge a single rechargeable battery?
I suggest rotating the batteries through the charger. If it takes two hours to get a full charge on two batteries, that would be 120 minutes. Total time to charge 3 batteries would be 50% more than that or 180 minutes. Put batteries in the charger for one-third of the 180 minutes which woulds be 60 minutes. Remove the battery from the left. Move the one from the right to the left. Move the extra one into the right position. Do that three times and the three batteries will each be charged the required amount of two hours.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
My favorite way to kill a fly is with a salt fly gun.  (Google those words and you will see what it looks like.)  It looks like a toy shotgun or rifle.  You cock it and when you pull the trigger it blasts a small amount of salt at the fly.  However, if you don't have a fly swatter you might not have a fly gun either.Regardless of how you kill the fly, one thing that may help is to immediately close the door of whatever room you are in. Cutting down on where the fly can go will allow you to kill is more easily.  It is also helpful, if you can shoo in into another room, to pick a room that contains lighter colors.  It is very difficult to see a fly against a dark background.  With the door(s) closed and a clear view of the fly you may then be able to search around for something to hit it with, whether it is a shoe, a rolled up newspaper, or whatever.  If you are feeling adventurous, try killing it with your hands, either by clapping your hands as it flies between them, or batting it out of the air to stun it, and then finish it off before it recovers.If the fly is on something you don't want to damage (for instance, as vase or trinket), try picking up the object from behind and then moving it towards your hand.  I actually killed a fly like this recently.  The fly won't sense the movement of your hand as easily as your hand is not moving.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
I catch them by hand. You just wait for them to land and then slowly bring your hand up behind them (or in front. Doesn't matter provided you are very slow). Have your hand ready to close/catch, then move like lightening! No need to kill them, just relocate them back outdoors (and wash your hands)!
What is the best way to open letter envelopes?
Method 1 - FreezingPut all the envelopes on freezer for two hours. It freezes the adhesive and a slight flip on the envelope flap with a knife will help. You can put inside a plastic cover before putting it inside the freezer, if you worry about the moisture.Method 2 - SteamIron the flap of the envelope with steam mode and pry to open the seal. This is the improved version of using water steam, but sometimes steam may make the envelope warped.  We can also use the steam from other sources like kettle or boiling water. I used steam iron because it is accurate on the flap and less effort. However this method is time consuming.Method 3 - MicrowavingPut all your envelopes in a microwave for 10-15 secs and slight flip on the flap of the sealed envelope is enough. This is good method and I have tried. Do not crowd the microwave with envelopes, make sure adhesives are exposed to microwaves.Microwave may burn any paper if it is thin and over heated, So just monitor it and increase +5 secs from 10 secs if needed. Use on own riskMethod 4 - Duct tapeIf you do not want the envelope for any reference and not worried on the duct tape cost, then stick some section of duct tape on the envelope and peel it off fast. It will make an opening in the envelope and so you can tear the envelope apart fully. 
How to remove ice from windshield
Water and vinegar on the windshield is supposed to de-ice a windshield.  Origins:   Claims about using a mixture of vinegar and water to remove  ice from a car's windshield hit the Internet every year around the  time of the first freeze in mid- to late-autumn. In recent years this  advice has been widely spread as information suggesting that spraying  vinegar and water (mixed in a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio) will remove ice from  an already iced-over windshield, but the tip originated not as a  de-icing method but rather as a way of stopping ice from building up  on a windshield in the first place, as noted in a 1992 newspaper Read  more at  http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/household/vinegar.asp#g2YAmZvvTbC6y0MF.99However some say it pits the windshield.A 1980 "Hints from Heloise" column advocated the same idea:  Looking  at the world through cloudy, streaked windows? Clean them with a  mixture of vinegar and water. Same with the windshield. Vinegar also  helps retard frost on those cold mornings if you pour it on the  windshield the night before (three parts cider vinegar to one part  water).   The issue of whether this method of ice prevention will  indeed pit windshield glass is a matter of contention, with some  cautioning that it does:  Pour a mixture of vinegar and water on the  windshield so that it freezes to the glass before the rain does,  thereby preventing ice. Unfortunately, vinegar eats pits into the  windshield glass. Read more at  http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/household/vinegar.asp#g2YAmZvvTbC6y0MF.99
What are some substitutes for gloves?
Some fabrics you could use are:Denim. This is durable and easy to clean. Its a cheap fabric that can be found on Jeans, Fabric stores or other articles of clothing. Other similar fabrics are Corduroy. These fabrics have less gripping, but if applied over clothing they can add to warmth. Apply it to sleeves in squares with sewing or fabric glue.Using tape works, as well. But duct tape is slippery and less durable to grabbing.

How do I put protective screens on, without getting air bubbles?
If you haven't yet removed the stock screen protector, you could try cutting off any protruding tabs and wiping off any logos and the like with tissue and a few drops of paint thinner. Saves you money and the hassle of putting on a new screen protector.If it is too late for that, or you need to swap screen protectors, or the stock screen protector is unusable, the following has usually worked well for me:Make sure the screen is clean. The best time to put on the screen protector is immediately after removing the old/stock screen protector. Else/additionally, wipe the screen with a lint-free cloth.Make sure you're in a low-dust environment.Apply the new screen protector. Start in one corner, then work your way from there slowly in one direction. Do not "slap" it on – this is what will get you air enclosures. You can use a credit card to put it on – if you don't press too hard, you should not have any issues with scratches.

Just put the knife in the little slot where the envelope is not sealed and just cut open the top of the envelope.Use a popsicle stickYou can also use a popsicle stick (preferably a thicker one) to open envelopes. Just put the stick in the slot (same as with the knife) and just run the popsicle stick from one end to the other. This is better if you don't want to damage the envelope.
What is the best way to open letter envelopes?
There are two easy ways to open an envelope without damaging the contents:Letter OpenerThis is by far the easiest method if you have one. Simply flip the letter over, slide the letter opener under the top flap and slide it across the top, cutting the top of the envelope. There is very little chance of cutting anything inside once you have the hang of it.Your HandThis is a very often overlooked tool to open letters. All you have to do is flip the letter over and insert your right thumb under the right side of the envelope flap and push it up. Then insert your pointer finger on your left hand under the flap and slide your hand over to the left. This will open almost any standard envelope without using any tools.
How do I put protective screens on, without getting air bubbles?
The easiest way is to leave the protective film on the back of the screen protector and place it over the top of the screen. Then slowly peel the back of the film off on one edge and carefully align it to your device and stick it on. Slowly peel the film off from underneath and work out the air bubbles if any appear. That way you won't have to lift off the protector to reposition it, and you will have a minimal amount of air bubbles.
How to stop red marks from wearing ballerina shoes?
The redness is caused by abrasion of the back of your heel rubbing on the heel of the shoe.You can try applying a layer of medical tape to your ankle before putting them on. It is similar to the band-aid solution, but the tape tends to stick better.
Any hacks for peeling garlic?
Use a sharp paring knife and slice down the back side of the clove (the convex part). With the tip of the knife, push it under the skin and that should let you peel it off the rest of the way.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
Flies have tiny little hairs which are sensitive to the slightest change in air pressure. When you swat at them with your hand, the change air pressure will alert them and they will fly in the opposite direction.The only way to effectively kill them with your hands is to confuse them by coming from two sides at once. Slowly position your hands on both sides of them just above where they are resting. Slightly cup your hands and make a clapping motion right above them. They will fly right into your hands and you will either catch them or kill them.
What is the best way to open letter envelopes?
I open envelopes by bumping contents to one side, then grasping the corner and tearing the end off the envelope. The strength of the folded paper structure usually causes the end to come off in a narrow strip. If any remains, insert a finger and tear it. The letter will usually fall out. This is quick, requires no tools, but also saves the envelope if needed.
What are some substitutes for gloves?
The cheapest and most durable is the latex coated glove made for gardeners (the average price is $1.75/pair) which can be easily carried.If you want some hacks you can make your own from jeans (denim) and paint/tar/silicone/flexible glue like:In this case you should calculate with the cost of used materials and the time spent!Nice LifeHacks in 2015!
How can I prevent pen ink from smudging on my hands?

I you use regular ballpoint pen just rotate your pen frequently (or use draft paper) to clean accumulated ink around the ball which cause smudging.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
There are many ways to do it:The most handy solution is: Breathe slowly and deeply with your mouth.Light a candy near the process.Chop under water.Freeze it before you cut it. 
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
Here are some methods I use:Cutting the Onion under water that is laced with vinegar or other acids or even just plain water helps sometimes to. I find it stops the onion smell from reaching me completely and saves my eyes. Some articles say use running water, but nobody has money or water for that. Tested: The Best Tear-Free Tricks for Cutting OnionsApparently putting your onion on a cutting board on a microwave or stove helps. Putting your cutting board on the stove and turning on the overhead  vent or microwave ventilation fan is supposed to redirect the  treacherous eye-irritating gases onions produce away from your eyes.This above article has how the article worked, as well. So that should help with research.Additional InfoWikiHowThis article uses a steam method. I have found that this does work, but putting water on to boil before cutting onions is really extreme. Cut the onion near hot running water or a cloud of steam. Steam from a  kettle or pan of water will do the trick. The science here is that the  steam will draw out the vapors from the onion, dissipating them.How to Peel an Onion QuicklyOther possibly non-helpful adviceUse a really sharp knife. This way you can cut faster. This is not really a hack.Keep your eyes closed. Not advised when cutting with a knife, but when using a peeler is helpful.I heard rubbing the onion down with acid works and soaking the onion before helps, but as I said I heard it. Acids like Vinegar, Vitamin C or etc are suppose to "kill" the odour.Working near the place you have to put the onions, also works. This wasy you can get them away from you faster. Freezing is suppose to work. I usually freeze for about 3-5 minutes. But you can freeze longer, just make sure to check the onion for freezing solid.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
Wetting the blade before starting to cut (and during) seems to help.Another trick I've read, but which I've never tried before, is putting the onion in the freezer for a few minutes before cutting.
What is the best way to open letter envelopes?
I have a little battery powered cutter that cuts a very narrow strip from the top of the envelope, I think I purchased it at Walmart. One place I worked at had a machine that costs about $200 if you  have a large amount of mail coming in. Check at some of the office supply stores if you want to go that route. 
How to stop graphite from smudging in a notebook?
Fixatives are the best. Try them on the sample sketch and also you need to know how much to apply. Keep a trace paper on each page of your book. Use sellotape to stick the top border with paper so as to avoid the moving of trace paper. Graphite does not stick to the glossy surfaced paper.You can also keep any other slick surfaced paper like photo printing paper or transparent book cover or laptop's screen guard. Stick the top border with the paper.TIPS:Common method is aerosol hair spray, but I do not recommend this because over the time paper will fade and turn pale yellow. Ruined many of my drawing sheets. When applying fixative sprays, do it outside or ventilated area as they are very toxic in nature. Many types are there, mainly 1. workable(spray while drawing) and 2.non-workable(post completion spray), they are glossy.Also I suggest if it is worth saving, put them behind glass.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
I use ski glasses, the kind that completely wrap your eyes. You can get away with the cheapest ones if you don't practice ski.Also the kind of protection glasses that you use to cover your eyes when sawing stuff may work.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
Its a slightly strange one, but chewing gum whilst chopping an onion actually seems to work to stop you from crying. I have tried it and it does work, for me at least. No idea why though.  
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
Here's my preferred solution — goggles:                   You said you don't have any, but you should be able to find a cheap pair of swimming goggles at any sports store or supermarket for less than $10.  (I bought mine at a local swimming pool for €5.)  Besides, if you like to go swimming, they'll also have a secondary use.Really, any eyewear that's more or less airtight, like the ski glasses suggested by Alexandre C., should work just as well.  Obviously, try to pick ones that are clear, rather than tinted like the pair in the picture (which were the only ones I happened to have at hand for the photo; I seem to have misplaced my usual pair of goggles).  Still, in a pinch, almost anything short of a welding mask will do.As far as fit goes, remember that most goggles are adjustable, and that for just chopping onions, you don't really need to have them fit very tightly.  Just loosen the strap a little bit if it feels too tight, and it'll be a lot more comfortable to wear.An alternative solution, if you happen to be cutting onions near a ventilated oven hood, is to turn the fan on.  It will suck in the fine mist of onion juice generated by chopping the onions, and keep it away from your eyes.Similarly, if you're cutting onions outdoors (say, while camping), simply try standing upwind, or a bit to the side.  (Standing directly upwind may not be optimal, since the wind will form eddies around your body.)  The wind will carry the onion juice harmlessly away.  You can also try this indoors in front of a window, but that's a bit more situational — the wind might not always happen to be blowing conveniently out of your kitchen window.
How to stop red marks from wearing ballerina shoes?
If you really must wear shoes that are damaging your feet in this way, buy some suede heel grips and stick those in the shoe in the right spot. This will make them grip tighter, stop them slipping and digging in, but check before sticking that they don't make the shoes too tight and force your toes to far forward, or you'll have sore toes as well.  Alternatively, use Pressure Point Foam padding, which has a sticky back (made by Scholl), though this latter may not stay so firmly in place. The only other thing I'd say is, if the red, sore area is right at the top of where the shoe sits, above your heel, and the shoes don't slip when you're wearing them, it may be that the height of the backs is fractionally too much for your foot - if that's the case, try wearing a gel heel insert inside the shoe to raise your foot up marginally so that the back of the shoe is pressing lower down, where it may not cause damage. I'd also suggest you don't wear the shoes at all until the damaged area on our ankle has healed completely, or you will develop a permanent bulge or lump in that area.I realise this answer is not exactly a 'hack' as such, because it means going out and buying the right stuff...
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
Fully open all windows and find a place where the air goes from the cutting board away from your face and cut the onion there. It's a bit risky because wind tends to change direction, but if you're quick enough, you can cut the whole onion before the gust of onion juice reaches your eyes. The key here is to live in a windy area or have a powerful AC unit.Just using a fan to blow the onion vapor out the window might not work very well. If you watch any video of a regular unmodified fan, you'll see that the air current it produces does not actually do a very good job of going in a single direction. This could result in onion vapor spreading all over the room you're in. Unless you modify the fan (place an array of cocktail tubes in front of it to straighten the air flow), it's not a guaranteed solution to avoid tears.You can also find a large enough plastic bag that will fit the onion, the knife and your cutting hand inside, put a rubber band over the bag's open end on your wrist and cut the onion inside the bag. This keeps the tiny droplets of onion juice from going anywhere, but you need to cut carefully so as not to cut through the plastic bag.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
Keep all the slices together while cutting, then put the slices away on the another cutting board; put your hands on the onion like this or in some other way (that can keep the slices together), like:sourceIf it won't stop your tears at all, it will at least decrease their amount :)Another tricky approach: put a blower near your cutting board, it could blow away anything that make your tears appear (even the onion itself, so be careful :D).Also it'll cool you if you are too active onion cutter.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
Simple: always cut onions near or, if possible, under, the running exaust hood, no tears whatsoever!
Any hacks for peeling garlic?
Take an empty clean glass jar (I find that a 1 litre empty honey jar works best, but you may prefer smaller jars).Place the garlic clove(s) in the jar, and close the lid tightly.Employing vigorous up/down movements on the jar, let the cloves bounce off its lid/bottom.After a few repetitions of step (3), the clove(s) will be peeled (either completely or to a degree that you can peel them like you'd peel a banana).That's it.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
I read this years ago in a Martha Stewart how-to book (hey, I was killing time in the book store), and it's always worked for me. I'll let Martha explain it... I copied this from:http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-08-17/news/9708170152_1_onion-root-end-lilacHere is the best method: Cut it in half from stem end to root end. Set  one half aside, cut side down, on your work surface. Cut off the stem  end of the other half and peel it. Place it cut side down on the  cutting board and make vertical cuts along the veins of the onion,  without cutting through the root end, which holds the onion together  as you work. Make a few horizontal cuts from the cut stem end toward  the root end. Then chop across the onion from the cut stem end to the  root end, resulting in beautiful, perfectly even dice.This works because it holds the onion together longer, so the gases released by the first several cuts have no place to go. The key is to avoid cutting all the way through to the root end of the onion. After your dicing cuts you'll end up with a small chunk of the root end of the onion, which you can either discard or chop the old-fashioned way.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
If you are in a restaurant, cutting the onions inside the walk-in freezer works. But it's cold.
How to stop red marks from wearing ballerina shoes?
First off be sure that the shoes fit properly.My personal experience in this area comes from other sports, primarily hockey, but there are some useful overlaps. Many hockey players wrap their feet and ankles before competing to prevent injury. This may not be an option during performances (aesthetics being more important there), but you may be able to get away with it for practices. The other option may sound a bit harsh and unsympathetic, but over time your feet will develop their own protection. If you can bear to tough it out, after a while you will form calluses. Don't remove them. Next time your with other experienced dancers ask around and take a look at their feet and ankles you'll very likely see occupational markers or calluses unique to dancers.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
You can use something like gass mask or mask and snorkel set. This is similar to the swimming goggles and ski mask and additionally they will not only protect your eyes but also prevent breathing it in. Some friends has tested this and they told me it works.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
There are volatile sulfur compound inside the cells of the onion. When those sulfur compounds hits your eyes, it causes them to tear. Note that neither plugging your nose or breathing through your mouth will help. As soon as that sulfur compound hits, your eyes, you'll tear. It has nothing to do with breathing.This means that any solution will have to keep that sulfur compound fumes away from your eyes will help.Blower to blow the fumes away from you.Cut the onion underwater, so that the sulfur compounds are dissolved in the water, and don't get into the air.Wear onion goggles.Refrigerate the onion. The sulfur compounds are less volatile when cold, so they're less likely to get into the air and into your eyes.Finally: Use a very sharp non-serated blade knife to cut the onion.Peel the onion by making a cut through the outer layers (not too deep) and try to remove the peel without tearing it. If you are a bit messy, that's okay, wash the onion off under cold running water as soon as the peel is removed to get rid of the liquid that contains the sulfur compounds.Now, chop the onion. Make sure the knife is very sharp. Sharpen the knife before you cut it. Again, do not use a serrated knife. If you can't sharpen a non-serated knife sharp enough to cleanly cut through a soft tomato, it's not sharp enough. If you can't seem to get the knife sharp enough with a sharpening stone, get something like the Chef's Choice Knife Sharpener. It's not a character flaw if you can't sharpen a knife on a sharpening stone, so don't feel ashamed. I in fact, have that very model of knife sharpener.Cut the onion with the knife. Slice through it. You want to make sure you don't tear the cells of the onion. Don't hack the onion to death. You're not a serial killer. You want clean cuts. Thin slices, and then cut through the slices perpendicularly.You should now have fairly small onion slices, and this may be enough for most cooking tasks. If you need a finer consistency, you can chop the onion.If you watch this video, you'll see how this chef slices through the onion and never hacks at it -- even when he is making cross hatches in the onion. Notice he sharpens the knifes before cutting the onion. Notice the knife he's using -- a big sharp and very fine bladed chef knife.Okay, he doesn't rinse the onion after peeling, but he probably chops it fast enough that it's not a problem. Besides, he's a professional, so don't try that at home - rinse the onion after peeling.
Prevent Smelly Sponges
You should not keep sponges and should throw them away after a few uses. They are cheap. A bag full costs little money. The kitchen sink is often the filthiest place in the house. Sponges retain food in the pores that cannot easily be removed. Unless you wash the sponge after every use and sterilize, it is best to throw away after two or three uses. Dish rags have a similar problem, cultivate growth, and are very dirty.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
Here is a method I have used for many years.  While chopping, hold a piece of bread in your mouth so it sticks out horizontally.  It will absorb those "little daggers" of acid which would otherwise end up in your eyes causing them to tear up.  A slightly stale piece of bread works best because it is less likely to droop down letting the droplets pass by and irritate your eyes.  I hope this method is not already listed since I didn't read all the answers.  I apologize if it has already been mentioned.
How to differentiate between natural and synthetic fibers quickly?
Though I disagree with the premise to "Wear natural fibres as synthetics tend to melt in a fire", since the artificial fiber Nomex (see http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/personal-protective-equipment/thermal-protective/uses-and-applications/fire-protection.html) is used in fire-protective wear, one simple test is to take a few fibers from the garment and try to set them afire. Cotton burns rapidly, rayon ("restructured" cotton) more slowly, nylon and polyethylene tend to form blobs that blacken and burn with a blue flame, wool and silk is more difficult to ignite and burn with the stench of burning eggs or chicken feathers.In any event, even if one were to survive a plane crash and then encounter a fire, cause of death is most often from smoke and flame inhalation. In that case, a survival mask might be of help: http://www.pksafety.com/sperian-survivair-cougar-scba-888888.html?gclid=CN_4k-m8-8ICFUsR7AodknAAnQ, if somewhat awkward to get aboard your flight.
How do I remove cloudy buildup from putting wine glasses in the dishwasher?
When I get these on my wine glasses, it's generally just some elbow grease with a dry washcloth that does the trick. To solve the problem forever, try softening your water. We got a Hague Water Max system a couple of months ago, and I haven't had spots on my glasses/dishes, since. 
How to remove wrinkles from a crumpled piece of paper?
You can iron it with not very hot iron (not to burn the paper).Another trick is to put it under some heavy books for several days.
How do I remove cloudy buildup from putting wine glasses in the dishwasher?
I could be wrong, but I got the impression that this "build-up" was actually "frosting" of the glass created by the abrasion in the dishwasher. Dishwasher detergent contains abrasive particles designed to "sand-blast" the deposits from dishes. I think delicate glasses simply can't take the punishment and the surface starts to go cloudy.
How do I remove cloudy buildup from putting wine glasses in the dishwasher?
There are two types of cloudiness - vinegar will remove the 'film' type, but it sounds like you have the same problem I had, which was an 'etching' of the glass itself from the abrasives as @Lefty mentioned.Etched glass is not a simple fix - you need to polish the glass back to smooth.From the Rocks and Gems site:Mix cerium oxide with water to create a slurry that's the same consistency as milk. Put the slurry on spinning buffing pad. Harder buffing pads made out of hard felt, or leather work best. The polishing action will be fastest when the cerium oxide is damp, but not dry, or runny wet. Fill a spray bottle with water and use it to keep the area you are polishing damp.The problem that site does highlight is that cerium oxide is now becoming difficult to find, so recommend tin oxide as an alternative.
Ηow can I keep my jeans' zippers from unzipping on their own?
In-built lock. Its already there on your zip. Just check it.Most of the jeans zips now come with In-built lock. When you zip just make sure that zip-hooker is placed vertically Down (this will lock the zip.) Just try to open the zip with hook placed down. It won't open Just like below image.(Zip hook placed vertically down here.)If you zip and don't keep hooker down zip will eventually run down due to strain on it.Visit YKK website for more info. If you see zips anywhere, there's 70% chance that it's made by YKK.Some low quality jeans might not use YKK produced Zip. That's why you should always check YKK mark on zip before buying jeans.
How do I remove postal stamps neatly from envelopes?
Use Ronsonol or a similar brand of lighter fluid (the type used to refill Zippo-style lighters NOT BUTANE). Soak the stamp with one or two drops of lighter fluid, particularly around the edges. After a few seconds you should be able to lift one edge of the stamp. If it's a large stamp or sticker you may have to apply another drop or two of lighter fluid under the edge so it can reach the adhesive near the center. Don't force it if the stamp doesn't come off easily. Apply another drop and give it a few more second. An ordinary size stamp should require just one or two drops of lighter fluid and 15-30 seconds to loosen the adhesive and remove the stamp plus another minute or two for the lighter fluid to air dry. The lighter fluid will dry clean without damaging the stamp or the envelope. It will not leave a watermark or cause the ink to run. (I use this trick to remove price tags and labels from used books.) Some adhesives are more adhesive than others, but I've never encountered an adhesive label or sticker that I couldn't remove with this method. The procedure is easy and straightforward but you may want to do a practice run on a stamp you don't care about damaging. Observe the obvious safety precautions while working with a highly flammable liquid. Don't work near an open flame. Don't smoke. Ensure adequate ventilation.
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
Personally I used Toilet Cleaning Brush whenever such thing happened:Don't think I need to explain how to use it for unclogging, however as you can imagine it's quite gross, that's why I'm open for other, more elegant, ways.
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
A bit gross and I'm not sure it is any more elegant but I have heard that a long ruler (a 30cm one) can be used as a 'chopping' device to make the 'obstruction' smaller, obviously it doesn't help in floating situations. I would recommend that it is a single use device though. You certainly don't want to take it back to your desk.
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
I have this problem in my house as we speak! I've tackled it a lot in the past and it doesn't usually involve using rulers or brushes.It really helps if you have another toilet and you can leave this one to "stew" for a while. The water will break down the blockage over time.I like to add a LOT of bleach to the water - this aids in the breakdown too. I sometimes add detergent but not sure if this really helps or not.Most effective is the use of PRESSURE. I usually achieve the additional pressure by filling the bowl as high as possible using an external source (to make sure it doesn't overflow). Usually the water will gradually trickle away, but you need to stand by and keep topping-up to keep the pressure as high as possible on the blockage.A combination of these techniques nearly always prevails eventually.UPDATE: After having typed above, went back to my toilet which had been left for about 3 hours. Filled it with water up to the brim and, like magic, the blockage swooshed away! 
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
Unwind a wire hanger, leaving a hook at one end. Stick it down the toilet and poke repeatedly to dislodge the clog. You can also use the hook to try to pull the clog back up (ew). This should eventually work.If the above fails, find some rubber gloves and a 2 liter plastic bottle. Push the opening of the bottle into the bowl and down the drain area. Try to create a seal around the drain and bottle as well as possible. Now squeeze the bottle (the first squeeze will let out air and might splash a bit, so gloves would help here). Then repeatedly squeeze the bottle until the clog has dislodged. This does a similar suctioning method as the plunger would, but is a bit harder to use.Instructions found here
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
A "plumber's helper" or plunger with an internal lip makes a better seal - see the picture (copied from WP); the one on the left has that lip. These may cost a bit more than the flat type, though. Yes, it's messy, but chemicals are dangerous and often ineffective. Another tool, if the plunger fails, is the toilet auger - a metal snake with a rubber or plastic sleeve to protect the china bowl. Though "life hacks" may be about saving money, these tools are necessities and are less likely to damage a toilet than coat-hangers, high-pressure hoses or caustics.
How can I make my shoes less slippery?
I sometimes use hair spray which I apply on the sole several times and waiting for 1-2 minutes between each spaying to let the hairspray become dry. This improves the friction, but unfortunately has only temporary effect.
How can I make my shoes less slippery?
You should wear in your shoes a bit. Walking on the smooth surfaces like ice does a little bit towards making the sole of your shoes less slippery as you understand, so you should walk more on the rough surfaces, like asphalt or something stony. Also you can rub thr soles of your shoes with something abrasive, like emery paper.
How can I make my shoes less slippery?
Try mixing sugar/salt with rubber glue. Coating the bottom of the shoe should do the trick. The sugar/salt grains texture the glue like sand paper. The glue...umm...sticks the grains to the shoe...Just make sure you don't use caster sugar, as the grain size is important.
What are some substitutes for gloves?
I feel your Pain. Sure, you can go buy "jersey gloves" anywhere, mine were 99 cents.That being said, it's a T-Shirt over your fingers. Any ideas of increased grip, protection from thorns, warmth, etc..... Not Happening.1st: PRIORITY: what exactly do you need them for? In your case, protection against piercing objects, aka finger protection.2nd: LIMITATIONS: Do you need a finger/thumb free for any reason? I.e. Touch screens, flipping lighters. 3rd: Cost: depending on you resources and supplies, if you do not want to spend ANY $, it's time to take inventory of what you Have.Supplies: duct tape, base gloves (like the cloth jersey-style), shoestring, string, scissors, knife, paper,pen or pencil,pieces of "junk" I.e. Thin tin, aluminum foil, cork board, cardboard, flexible rubber, hard rubber, hard plastic that can be cut, dryer lint, CLOTH (Not just denim, Canvas is The Best, the more durable, the better, BUT it needs to be pliant, to move your fingers. From there, it's all about what you need. For thorns, your MainHand Right or Left, should be given an extra Layer. Perhaps your offhand could provide a cut-off index finger for touch screens or the same for thumb for lighters, etc.Then: can you do a mitten shape? Easier all around, but no practical for thorns, heck I don't know, it's up to you. Paper/thin cloth/anything you can cut and is movable and comfortable: trace hand over 2x folded paper. That's your pattern. For mittens keep fingers semi-closed, for fingèrs, spread hand out, to ensure thickness around fingers. If you can make your own gloves using spit and paper,glue, tape, whatever, you can make gloves protecting anything. There will be trial and error. Cut them out after 2 exaggerated copies of both hands. Now you have a base. TEMPORARILY Cut/spit/tape/paste to fit. BUT don't secure anything yet. Now look at what you have already from list above,and what you thought of while reading me. My favorites as a 1st layer: t Shirt fabric, old soft towels, COMFORT is king. 2nd layer: Duct Tape. aluminum foil, pieces of old rubber inner-tubing or old kitchen glove pieces. Remember,pliable. This is gonna bend. Reinforce joints as much as possible,but not too thick. I have used all of the above, but you are gonna need an adhesive. Glue, Wax, TREE SAP, tape, whatever. Set out your base layer. Threading is nice, but you cam use any adhesive you can find. Look at "pressure points" for the job. Those need reinforced. Remember Pliability, but I made some Bitchin Mad Max gloves that included pieces of tin/copper/steel/iron and lead (watch out for load)For you, you want the PINCHER design re: thorns. Main Hand forefinger and thumb need to be the strongest. Sap really does work well with thin fabric. Will they last? No, they are homemade with tree sap!My Ideal Design:       Cotton or fleece 1st layer. Finger Design, with cup-like mitten fold over. (Pattern on paper with fingers very slightly apart) use a safety pin or button and thread to hold finger cover on) if I use this, I may put something heavier on at least one mitten, metal, defense or frustration in mind. Or not.Duct Tape is good, but only on fingertips, palms, wrists, and between knuckles. Pliability!So you have at least Paper Gloves with 2 sides "glued", threaded, safety pinned, band aided, whatever. Go to town. One Glove at a time with hand in if possible, add string, tape, bungee, wire mesh, anything you can adhere to the outside. Not too tight on string and same rules as Duct Tape. I love the string type method as well. Now, aside from joints you have a canvas. Go crazy with the paint!Reinforced pincher fingers: do you have any rubber? Mix it in for grip as a 3rd layer.Knuckles? For extra "punch", use your imagination. Duct tape plus wax plus more duct tape, or mix in some metal, thread rope horizontally across and add dimes under duct tape. Spikes are tricky, If you need them, Figure it Out.  Make mistakes at your own peril with sharp objects. I prefer metal under the pinky to wrist area, use as a hammer..Base=comfort and support, wrist support can be added by using coat hangers either wrapped or errrrrrrr clawed.".Secondary: essential surface that is your canvas to suit your needs. PLIABLE.TERTIARY: added reinforcement where you need it, want it or might Need it. Think fleece or cotton with superglue reinforced by tape, then strips of duct tape around anything that does not bend. Or deerskin, moleskin, rats kin, make sure it is secure. The best base is 99 cents and. From there, you can make gloves for gardening, or for combat against the Sharks, or Skinheads. In that case, remember the hammer blow, and avoid glass in any capacity" also, don't fight. Thin wire can be the best of all, but it takes awhile to construct. But you can salvage it easily, champagne wire over cork for example, wire from cords, coat hangers, all is good stuff.OK an hour of my life for ideas. Buy the 99c Jerseey Gloves as a base. Thin wire around finger tips but not thumb' then duct tape. Coat hangers for wrist/forearm, mix with your favorite rope, metal' or dare I say it Spike. Leave a way to get to skin somewhere whether by mitten flap or open. I use RIGHTY Index, Lefty Thumb.  Good Luck.

How can I make my shoes less slippery?
I have a pair of crocs and the rubber soles are extremely slippery on smooth surfaces, especially steel overbridges. I face even more trouble on wet tile floors.However, one day by accident, I walked on a road (undergoing maintenance) with molten asphalt and that stuck to my soles real well. Ended up having some good traction on my shoes. Maybe if you could get your hands on some molten asphalt it could do the trick for you. Alternately, you could try some cement (Don't know about this one, just guessing)
Ηow can I keep my jeans' zippers from unzipping on their own?
Two solutions, with some top notch drawing (I'm clearly the next Vincent Van Gogh).Tie a thin piece of string  through your zipper the hole at the top of your zipper and your belt. However, have the string go through the inside of your pants, then out from the top of your pants, and then tied into your belt. This will be much less visible than if the string went outside the pants, especially if you can find string the same colour as your belt.Put tape on the inside of your pants, where it's not visible. Use this tape to tape the zipper to the top of your pants.
How can I make my shoes less slippery?
Cut a strip of sandpaper and glue it to the sole. Try different placements for optimal result.
Ηow can I keep my jeans' zippers from unzipping on their own?
I sometimes use a paperclip, passing it through the hole in the zipper and trying to attach it to the jeans' fabric and/or move it around so that the zipper does not move. This depends on the kind of jeans and requires testing until you find something that works for you.
How to work around European size hardware measurements
Saying  European measurements is not a proper terminology and that is the reason you had a confused clerk at the hardware store.There are two standard measurements in the world, metric and imperial. Imperial is miles yards, feet, inches etc. Metric is meters, millimeters, centimeters etc.if your furniture was made in Europe the hardware is more likely then not metric. Take a bolt or nut to the hardware store with you. Show it to the clerk and tell them what you need. 
How to work around European size hardware measurements
If you're trying to get an imperial bolt to screw in to metric nut, that's likely pretty hopeless. Beyond the obvious length and diameter issue you will likely encounter differences in the thread pitch. Imperial bolts typically use the Unified Thread Standard (UTS) while metric bolts typically use ISO standard threads.While there may be a few that seem to screw together, at best you'll end up with a loose, wobbly, and potentially dangerous connection. Save yourself the the time and aggravation and use one or the other.If you're just looking for a tool that will work for both metric and imperial you could try a crescent wrench or adjustable spanner.
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
Use a toilet plunger. That's what it was designed for, and if you use it right, won't splash at all. Most people have one by the toilet, or in a small closet nearby. It's far more effective than using a brush, and much less messy.
Prevent Smelly Sponges
Washing out a sponge and wringing out as much water as you can after you are done using it will help inhibit odor causing bacteria/fungi from growing on it.You can also try leaving it in a basket next to your sink. This will allow the sponge to dry out more thoroughly than just leaving it in the sink.When all else fails, and your sponge still smells, then you can use white vinegar, or hand sanitizer to get the smell out.
How to walk through deep snow at a faster pace and keep feet/legs dry as possible?
Your 2 main options will probably be making a sled and/or snow shoes.A sled can be fashioned from a number of household items, you basically just need something that is relatively light weight and flat to convex. A large plastic trashcan lid should do the trick nicely without any modification if you're only using it for short slides.Snow shoes will need a little more thought and work. You're pretty much looking for something that can be strapped to the bottom of your shoe that will give you enough surface area to walk on top of the snow, without being so heavy or awkwardly shaped that they're hard to walk in.Some ideas for quick improvised snow shoes:Tennis rackets5-gallon bucket lidsPVC pipe and twine, more time consuming but you'll have a better end result.Or if you have a little more time you could try a traditional approachI would go with a combined approach if you're in a hilly area. Use the sled to go down hill and shoes to go up hill.Also, be sure to reheat the tacos before serving...
How to walk through deep snow at a faster pace and keep feet/legs dry as possible?
The obvious household item would be garbage bags — they are found in most homes (advanced recyclers excepted), they are waterproof, and they are large enough to stick a foot in and cover a fair bit of your leg. Tie them to your trouser legs with an elastic, with paperclips, with sticky tape or anything you have on hand.Hopefully your shoes can stand the snow, in which case you're probably better off with your socks inside the bags but the bags inside the shoes. If you put the bags outside the shoes, they're likely to tear up pretty quickly.Snowshoes or skis would be more comfortable, but that's not something you can so quickly build from common household items. You could try fastening a pair of wooden boards or metal trays to the bottom of your shoes to prevent sinking in the snow, but I do not recommend that: you could break an ankle if the support gets caught in something. If you go that route, strive to make the fastening between the shoe and the support strong enough to last the whole way but not so strong that your ankle would break before it. Cardboard snowshoes might actually work best for a quick-to-build solution, and they'd be flexible enough not to endanger your ankles, but I don't know if they'd last the whole way. Maybe snowshoes made of cardboard wrapped in a garbage bag?A realistic alternative might be to pay someone with snow shoes or snow tires or skis to deliver.
How to walk through deep snow at a faster pace and keep feet/legs dry as possible?
You can make snow gaiters out of some household materials. Take some plastic wrap (the thin transparant material typically used for sealing food items in containers to keep them fresh over a longer period of time). Wrap some of this around each of your legs and shoes except the sole because you don't want to slip on the snow. I am trying to explain that you can make something like this as shown on the picture:And you can also put elastic hair ties on your shoes to keep the plastic wrap on your feet. You will look very funny with these plastic gaiters, but they will protect your feet from moisture. 
How can I keep cables from falling off of desks when unplugged?
What causes cables to fall behind the desk once unplugged? The weight of the cable is sufficient to drag the cable down because there isn't enough friction between the portion of the cable on top of the desk and the desk surface.I do IT work and often unplug everything and take the laptop/tower from the user's desk, but I don't want to fish around for individual cables when I replace the machine. So I use a hook and loop (Velcro™) fastener to simply bind all of the cables together. The net effect is that, bound together, they have enough weight and friction to simply sit atop the desk surface. Of course someone could push the bundle off the desk, but left alone it is usually sufficient:no desk protrusionssupports heavier cables (the more cables the better)lays horizontally on deskIf you don't have a hook and loop fastener, you can use an elastic band, a hair tie/scrunchie, a hair clip, zip tie (if you're not doing this often and have wire cutters as I do), tape, or a piece of wire.Finally, if the bundle of cables is still trying to pull itself behind the desk, you might need to weigh it down a bit more, and a wrist-rest (as mentioned in another answer) works great. I've also let a desk stapler do the job of holding cables until I return. By this I mean using the stapler itself as additional weight, with the cables held between the base and upper portion.
How to walk through deep snow at a faster pace and keep feet/legs dry as possible?
When I have to spend several minutes in deep snow, I wear two pairs of pants, an interior layer (Usually Pajama pants), which I actually pull my socks up over the hem of, and an exterior layer (Jeans).
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
A builder friend of mine who services student accommodation passed on this great tip that requires only a readily available and disposable tool - and no gloves:get a garbage bag.  Most homes will have one, often in the bathroom.  Check it has no manufactured perforationspush one arm down to the bottom of the bag and hold the rim of the bag with the otherusing the hand inside the bin bag, reach under water to the drain hole.  You may feel wet at this point - you aren't.now pump the palm of your hand over the drain hole as a crude plunger OR simply use your fingers to remove the obstructiononce the blockage is dislodged or pulled out, the bowl should empty.invert the bag by clenching your hand and pulling towards you while holding the opening in place over the bowl. discard.It's not usually necessary to hold the blockage inside the garbage bag, although this can be done if the blockage was something that didn't belong in the toilet in the first place - simply hold onto it as you invert the bag.Garbage bags are also known as a trash bag, bin bag, refuse sack, black bag, etc, a well known brand is Hefty bag but many others and cheap generics are available.  Plastic carrier/shopping bags often have perforations (as do garbage bags in some regions - @Angelo), and are prone to rip or puncture, so avoid.
How do I remove or clean the glitters from my skin?
Try a lint roll. Made to tidy slacks and such, it may work very well for the glitter. Can be found at most food stores, drug stores, Walmart etc., for around four or five bucks. lint roller
How do I remove or clean the glitters from my skin?
This may work:First brush them off yourself, the idea is to get as many of these things off as possible. Because water can make them even more sticky in some cases use a dry brush or cloth.  Even rubbing your hand across your body to get them off will work for the brunt of them.Getting a shop vac or nozzle attachment for your vacuum cleaner can help you use that to suck all the glitter off. Alternate rubbing with the cloth gently to loosen the particles and then sucking with the nozzle to remove them. This step is really good for when it is thrown like a powder.You should be almost clean now. Get a good soap that is really foamy and soap up with it. This method should remove the dry glitter, if it was sticky then see the alternative step. The idea is to get a really foamy soap that disconnects the adhered glitter and lets it fall away, dish soap is not advisable as it dries the skin out to fast, but some bubble baths and shampoos may helpAlternative Method:To loosen sticky bonds try lemon juice and baking soda as a scrub, rubbing alcohol, or even vinegar. Using oil after the acid scrub helps to moisturise the skin and clean off any remaining glitter, then doing a scrub again helps. Remember to let the oil stay on the skin for a while.As the other answer suggests a lint roller may help. However, here are some methods to create a cheap Lint Roller.Using Masking Tape or similiar. Rub this across your body, but a lint roller is usually different and this may pull hair. If you dab with it that works better. Also, rub the tape against something else to lessen the effect and then it will pull hair less and in some cases not at all. Tips:Clean from top to bottom and when touching a clean area make sure no glitter is on your hands. This way no contamination results and no glitter falls back onto your body.Soaking in a tub for step 3 while rubbing down with a cloth or brush(is better) helps clean it off.Additional InfoYahoo AnswersI have never used this, so be aware that this may not work and this may be Yahoo Answers saying crazy things again. Also, it is not advisable to put nail polish remover on your skin.From the User Replace:Try WD-40 or rubbing alcohol.From the User Amelia:Try taking a cotton ball soaked with nail polish remover and soak the  glitter directly for about 30 seconds or longer, that should break it  downSo taking from that answer a strong acid like vinegar or maybe even a chemical like rubbing alcohol should work like I said.
What can I use for an improvised ice scraper?
I use a the back side of a pocket comb. It is an item that I usually have in my pocket, is strong enough to withstand serious scraping, and it comes out of the experience completely unharmed. 
How to walk through deep snow at a faster pace and keep feet/legs dry as possible?
With snowshoes, you will be able to walk on snow without falling deep inside the snow and waterproof leggings, you should stay dry.Also you need waterproof shoes, as the snow shoes will only prevent you from falling to deep in the snow but not prevent the shoes from getting wet.
How do I soften my beard without going to a beauty parlour?
I'm not clear whether you mean to soften it before shaving (in which case, steam) or whether you just want a softer feeling beard. If the latter, wash it with shampoo and then apply hair conditioner, combing it through, rinse it off, and when its dry, use hair straighteners if you want to stop it being curly (if by 'iron' you actually do mean smoothing out or de- creasing with heat). In theory, you could use an iron and board, but its a bit risky - hard to get the temperature right and avoid burning your skin.

I find it's enough to pour some boiling water over it every now and then.
How to get rid of the 'farmyard' smell from a goose down pillow?
Down is a great natural loose fill fiber providing both warmth and comfort.  Unfortunately it absorbs odors, can host dust mites, and may mildew and mold if not regularly laundered and kept dry.Check the pillow for rips or tears, and repair before washingWash on gentle/delicate cycle - you may need to balance the load with another pillow or other article about the same size and weight of the pillowRinse twiceDry on gentle/delicate, stopping the dryer frequently to fluff (ie, separate the down) the pillow until completely dryRepeat of any odors still lingerThis should eliminate any residual smells from the pillow.  If it doesn't then you may need to replace the pillow to eliminate the smell.
How do I safely clean a laptop using scuba gear?
While I wouldn't suggest using your expensive (and life critical!) SCUBA equipment for cleaning duty, if it's all you have, it'll work.  Scuba tanks are often pressurized to several thousand PSI, which is a hundred times more pressure than you want for blow gun use.  The regulators used in scuba diving bring this pressure down, often in two stages with two regulators.  The mouthpiece often contains the second regulator.The first stage regulator, closest to the tank (often on the tank) brings the pressure down to a usable range for cleaning items using a blow gun, though it's still higher pressure than most home/shop air compressors, so you'll want to be careful, or adjust this regulator to a lower pressure output. If you have no other tools or extra hoses, simply disconnect the output hose of the first stage from the second stage/mouthpiece.  Turn the air tank valve to open and air will rush out the hose.  Keep a firm grip on the hose when the valve is open, even at these moderate pressures, a whipping hose with metal connectors on the end can cause significant injury.Many first stage regulators have limiters to prevent air loss in case of leaks, but it should permit enough air for cleaning purposes - just don't expect to be able to run air tools continuously from this without a more suitable high flow regulator.Also, letting the air out of a scuba tank quickly in this manner may result in condensation inside the cylinder which may eventually damage the cylinder.  It's really not a good use of life-critical SCUBA equipment, and particularly for high pressure cylinders. Make sure you inspect your tanks internally on a regular basis if you plan to use them for this purpose.
Ways to improve water pressure?
If you get a narrower head, the water will come out faster, so it will feel like there is higher pressure, even though the water is low in volume. You can even get a head that puts the water out in one narrow stream, which can be quite sharp. There's nothing you can do to improve the pressure in an apartment complex, other than trying to get your shower at a time when everyone else is not likely to be running water. Showers, dishwashers, and washing machines (not everyone has these last 2) use a lot of water, so 2 running at once will not improve your experience. 
How do I trim my facial hair symmetrically and the same every time
One way to accomplish this is to buy some window cling inkjet paper, then take two photographs of your face.  One head on, and one from the side (pick the side that's looking better).  Cut the head on face in half, and mirror one side of it to the other. Also take the one side photo and mirror it.  You should have three images - one head on, and one right, and one left.  All of them should only have original imagery from one side of the face, though, due to the mirroring.  Expect them to look/feel strange - your brain recognizes your face very well, and when presented with an altered face it'll notice and tell you something is wrong.  Ignore that.Print these out a little bit smaller than life size onto the window cling inkjet paper, and place them on your mirror at a comfortable height.  You should now be able to look at yourself through the window cling from the front and both sides.  Even with full color, you should be able to see your face through the window cling, but depending on the cling, printer, and images this might be difficult - adjust the image transparency or brightness and try again.  You'll also have to adjust the size a little bit.  Since your mirror self is in the distance and visually smaller, the printout will need to be slightly smaller than life size, but not by much.  Now you should be able to very closely attain a consistent, symmetrical look.Warning: Most faces aren't perfectly symmetrical.  Don't blame me if you find out that one ear is slightly higher than the other, or that your eyes aren't exactly perpendicular to your nose/mouth.  If this does turn out to be a problem, then make it as symmetrical as you can, then take three pictures without using any mirroring.
How do I remove or clean the glitters from my skin?
If I ever get glitter on me and wiping it off doesn't work, I use play dough. When you push the play dough across your skin, it picks up the glitter. It's safe, easy and can even be used to clean glitter off of the furniture in your house too.
How do I remove a bandage from thin skin?
I don't have any other solution for you, besides using a dedicated adhesive remover like this one. They're pretty cheap, at ~$10 for 50 wipes, though you could probably find them cheaper if you tried.I've used them (though not on regular bandaids, admittedly), and they work as advertised, though I've never had the problem of thin skin that rips.
How to get stains out of the garage floor
While not a quick fix, using muriatic acid to wash the concrete floor will get a lot of the surface stains. You may have to use it multiple times to get a really deep stain out. Then there are issues around handling an acid (safety, disposal, etc.). Also, if the surface of the concrete has been sealed, you will have to remove the seal before any cleaning agent will work.Another option would be to paint the concrete. This will probably be outside the price range of $10 to $15. Looking at some other solutions to this issue (I have not tried these):Oven Cleaner: Get those unsightly grease, oil, and transmission fluid stains off your concrete driveway or garage floor. Spray them with oven cleaner. Let it settle for 5-10 minutes, then scrub with a stiff brush and rinse it off with your garden hose at its highest pressure. Severe stains may require a second application. Soda: Here’s how to remove oil stains from concrete drive-ways and garage floors: Gather up a small bag of cat litter, a few cans of cola, a stiff bristle broom, bucket, laundry detergent, bleach, eye protection, and rubber gloves. Cover the stain with a thin layer of cat litter and brush it in. Sweep up the litter and pour cola to cover the area. Work the cola in with a bristle broom, and leave the cola for about twenty minutes. Mix 1/4 cup laundry detergent with 1/4 cup bleach in 1 gallon (3.7 liters) warm water and use it to mop up the mess.WD-40: Did a leaky oil pan leave a big ugly spot in the middle of your concrete driveway? To get rid of an unsightly oil spot, just spray it with a generous amount of WD-40 and then hose it down with water.Found at: http://www.rd.com/home/cleaning-concrete-stains/
How to get stains out of the garage floor
You can use cat litter as this works really well. Cat litter works good for cleaning oil spills, but also for cleaning many spots, especially greasy ones. Pour a small amount onto the spot and rub into the spot, pulverizing with your shoe. Sweep up when finished and maybe do it a second time.If it's a greasy spot, pour fresh oil onto the spot first to dissolve and break it up, then use cat litter to take up the oil.If a chemical is used, cat litter will help pick up what's left.
How do I remove a bandage from thin skin?
Try spraying "Goo Gone" under the bandage or tape as you slowly pull off. Go slow enough to allow the adhesive to dissolve slightly and spray as you go.
How to get stains out of the garage floor
The way my dad taught me to do this would be to saturate the area with kerosene (cheap and readily available), scrub with a stiff nylon brush, then spray off using a garden hose with a nozzle to increase water pressure.  Then you repeat because it never all comes off the first time.We did occasionally use muriatic acid for this as a last resort on extreme stains, but it requires a great deal of care. Because it is an acid, you need to be careful about splashing yourself and breathing it, the hands-and-knees work is limited, but also it will not just clean concrete, it can dissolve it too if left on too long.  A safer acid to try would be phosphoric acid, less strong but a whole lot safer.Another cheap and useful cleaner would be tri-sodium phosphate.  Tri-sodium phosphate is a crystalline cleanser similar to soap.  It will break down oils so it is useful for both dissolving the grease stain and also for dissolving other oil-based chemicals you have applied (like the kerosene).
How do I remove a bandage from thin skin?
An easy way to remove bandages is to apply either baby oil or olive oil. Simply dip a cotton ball or a q-tip (preferably a cotton ball) into the oil and gently rub it on the bandage until it comes off. This is a very easy, cheap, and painless method for removing bandages. I use it all the time.
How can I make my shoes less slippery?
Pine resin works well. A big pine near my house was cut down, and I dissolved some of the sap in a mix of acetone and alcohol (flammable!). It works well as antislip, and is clear. Of course, after your shoes pick up dus, it is less effective.
How do I remove a bandage from thin skin?
Is it not acceptable just to leave it in place and let it fall off itself after a few days? So long as it's a "breathable" type there's no immediate need to remove it I would have thought.Alternatively, maybe try an ACTUAL bandage wrapped around and pinned rather than glued - or an elastic version? You would use a gauze or pad under the bandage to do the protective work and the bandage just holds that in place.
How to quickly remove stains made of semen from clothes
Of course its best to avoid this altogether. So having a hanky ready (that is outside of a container) and close to your hand (e.G. in your jackett/coat pocket) and apply directly after/during ejaculation will reduce the amount of situations where leftovers are on clothes. If you happen to have this kind of sex regularly this should be a permanent preparation.To clean: First remove the semen as quickly as possible by placing your finger next to it (not on it) and roll it up while moving over the semen. Use each finger only once or clean it after use with a towel. Speed is important. Most fabric will not soak up the liquid instantly so you can reduce the intense of the spot if you remove it quicker. Semen is kinda sticky and so is your finger. This works best on jeans or similar fabric that is kinda water repelling. If available, use tampons for this task, they work even better then fingers.The goal here is to lift the semen from the fabric, be careful not to rub it in more then absolutely necessary.Then spit on your hand (or use water if available) and press the cleaning liquid through the fabric (from the inside) so that the ejaculate is diluted and replaced by spit / water. The goal here is to replace the highly visible white semen with a less visible kinda clear liquid.Then wait as long as possible. Semen changes color to a semi-transparent yellow after some minutes and thus becomes less visible, also some parts dry. If possible press fabric that is not visible (socks) on the wet spot to dry it quicker. DO NOT USE PAPER TOWELS! They are likely to leave small white particles on your clothes that shine like stars on black fabric.If nothing helped, create a distraction. If you wear a shining red flower in your jackets front pocket nobody will care about your pants. Of course that only works so long, so be sure to properly clean yourself soon or go grab your spare pants from the car.
How do I remove a bandage from thin skin?
Depending on the kind of glue used ethanol works great for this. You can get pure un-denatured ethanol at your pharmacy if its a prohibited item in your country (as it is in mine).Apply very small doses of it as larger spills will irritate seriously sensitive skin. You might want to use cotton swaps. Just put the ethanol on the outside of the bandage above the glue and it will fall off by itself after a minute or so.If any rips occur while removing the bandage you can use this as sterilizer as well. I've heard that there are ethanol based sterilizers as well, they should be best as they are meant to be used on injured skin.
What are some substitutes for gloves?
I have made frequent use of duct tape in this situations. First layer is with sticky side out wrapped LOOSLY! around your hand, then cut it off and add a second layer with sticky side to the inside above the first layer.That way you have the silver side inside and out and have some useful makeshift gloves.If you want more softness wrap cloth around your hand before creating the gloves. This will give you good grip on many things as well, but I would not want to climb with such gloves.As duct tape is an incredible useful tool anyway you would want to keep some rolls in your car / backpack anyway. So, if you forgot your gloves make some with tape.There is a more complex way in creating duct tape gloves described in this video. It will fit better then just wrapping it around but it take considerably more time (15 minutes).
How do I stop my earphones from getting tangled
When you fold the wire in a daisy chain pattern it will be too stiff to entangle, yet easily open able. (This video shows what I mean)This is especially useful if you want to store the earbuds for a prolonged time, but after some getting-used-to one can do this in a short moment.In words you would do it like this:Hold the cable at all three ends at once and detect the middle.Grab the cable at the middle letting the ends go.From now on keep the two/three cables always together, don't just grab one.Make a small loop on the middle by twisting the bent cable into itself (like a snake-house).now grab through the loop and hold the cable above the loop, pulling it back through the loop, creating another loop (about three fingers wide or smaller).let go of the cable part you just pulled through and reach through the freshly created loop.repeat #5 and #6 until the whole cable is in small interwinded loops.Fold the cable and put it in your pocket.To open just grab the cable ends and pull, it should unchain itself. 
How to make my batteries work for a short time, one last time

Cleaning/removing wax from carpet
There are two ways that I've found to remove wax from a carpet.Before using either method try scrape off and pick up any large clumps of wax from the surface of the carpet.The iron method:Preheat your iron on a lower setting, if your iron has a setting for synthetic fabrics use it.Place a few (2-4) layers of paper towel over the wax spot.Gently place the iron on the paper towel. Try not to press down or rub too much, you don't want the wax to further embed in the carpet. Think blotting not scrubbing.After about 5-10 seconds pick up the iron.You should see that some of the wax has melted and absorbed into the paper towel, if not put the iron back on for a couple more seconds.Repeat steps 2-4 until you've melted and blotted up all of the wax.The coffee maker and shop vac method:Use a coffee maker to heat water.Add water to coffee maker as usual and turn it on, just don't add coffee grounds.Depending on the type of wax you may need water that is hotter than your coffee maker can provide, in this case heat the water in a kettle or microwave, just be sure that the water isn't at a rolling boil to avoid damaging the carpet.Pour hot water on the wax to melt/soften it.Quickly extract, or suck up, the hot water and melted wax with the shop vac.It is important to be quick here. Have your shop vac on and ready before pouring the hot water. If you're too slow the water will cool and the wax will set.It is probably worth mentioning that these methods also work for removing deodorant and other wax like stuff from carpets.
How to determine how much heating oil is left in the tank?
I can't tell if this is possible from the picture but before the time of gauges when you needed to know how much liquid was in the tank you would open the top of it, insert a long stick, pull it out and see how much of it is wet to show the level of liquid.
How to determine how much heating oil is left in the tank?
You can use temperature strips purchased at a hardware store to show you where the oil level is. These strips change color with temperature, showing you where the cooler (or warmer) fuel oil is my measuring the temperature of the outside of the metal tank. If the room changes temperature throughout the day (like a garage), the strip will tell you where liquid resides inside the tank by indicating where the tank itself is heating/cooling more slowly than the ambient temperature.Note that if the temperature of the room remains relatively constant (like a basement), you can pour a bit of hot water over the strip to indicate where the cooling effect of the heating oil is keeping the temperature of the tank from going up.Propane tanks use this same principle, although the cooling effect of releasing pressurized propane gas doesn't really apply to your oil tank, but you can apply the same principle of temperature differences nonetheless.If the length of the strip is an issue (i.e. you want to measure more than the "low mark" of the tank), you can always use thermochromc paints or films to create a temperature-sensitive strip over a longer length. Just be sure the pigments you select are designed to change within the temperature ranges you have in that room.
How to determine how much heating oil is left in the tank?
For a quick work around when the gauge is broken, no shopping trips needed, no tools needed, simply tap on the side of tank starting from the top and going down. The sound will change when you reach the approximate of the remaining fuel.Also if you have a cap on top of the tank and enough clearance above the tank, you can use a long stick to determine the level, just like an oil dipstick.

How can I clear my shower drain without drain cleaner?
The best for me is the rubber plunger, but when I don't have it I use a long piece of thick wire to clean the drain as much as I can. After that I pour very hot water to dissolve any soap or other material which make the hair stick to each other. Usually the electric water boiler (like the one on the picture) is the easiest to boil water and carry it to the bathroom while it is still with high temperature.When I pour the water in the drain bubbles appear, because the air cached inside increases its temperature and volume and the increased pressure helps to clear the drain.
How to determine how much heating oil is left in the tank?
Like before the user Jon has answered, I would recommend you highly make a new gauge.I would not play with knocking on the tank nor use this propane toys for this.I think the big pipe (on the left side) is the input, right the output and in the middle is a cap (with of course i think the broken gauge)If you have time to fix this problem, you can go to your local Hardware Store and buy a double meter stick made of plastic or better a Swedish model (made of wood). Also maybe buy a new cap, one that you can turn on simple with one hand. Then put the meter in the tank, mark it and cut it, so that you just can crap it close by hand at the top (of course the cap must be turn on also).Then you have a good solution if you use this yearly. otherwise the effort is not worth.this is also the solution that real tanks must have.I think this isn't' a good example of a lifehack question.if you like you can mark the meter stick (calculate 1/4 full, 1/2, ect...)
How to avoid being infected by a colleague
Use surgical mask (Japan style face-mask)! This is a true Life Hack !These masks can protect against droplet infection and can be made by just wrapping a cloth around your face or making some yourself. They are also rather better looking than regular masks and offer protection.
How to avoid being infected by a colleague
First and foremost methods are using droplet protection and cleaning whenever you touch something that is infected.Besides washing your hands and making sure you and other people cover their mouth when sneezing or coughing you could also do these methods:Make a Face Mask. These can be made out of handkerchiefs, high collars(if you aren't suppose to wear one, but you need to), disposable paper products that can be thrown away after you use them once. You could buy ones but these are home-made ones.Make a barrier. This can be done by putting high boundaries up, like books, laying coats across the area and etc. Anything that will protect against droplet infection.Prevention of Droplet-spread Illnesses: Avoid close contact.Germs are transmitted easily when you live in  close quarters, especially during winter months when we stay indoors.  If you have a droplet-spread illness, avoid getting close to  colleagues, friends, or family members. Tell them you're sick and that  you don't want them to catch the virus. This helps protect them from  getting sick, too.And remember to hand wash and disinfect things that a lot of people touch before eating or use.  You should wash or disinfect your hands whenever you've touched  something that an infected person might recently have touched:  computer keyboards, telephone receivers, doorknobs, elevator buttons,  faucet handles, countertops, railings, and so on.Using your sleeve when touching objects also helps. Using Vitamin C and other vitamins that promote immune health are suppose to help, but never overdose and consult a doctor. Vaccines are a must and depending on a the place you work, the vaccine may be free.Additional InfoStandard Precautions.Common Colds: Protect Yourself and Others5 Ways to Stop Colds From Spreading in Your FamilyKnow your company policy, and remember to always review it. If a person is spreading disease and other illness they may not be suppose to go work and they could be sent home depending on the policy. Remember hand-washing protects against many diseases while using sanitizers doesn't. Sanitizers are good if you can't get to a sink. Always wash hands if they are visibly soiled, sanitizer will only make mud. Disinfecting sprays can be made with 1/4 cup bleach and 1 gallon of water. 
How to stop leather from making stain on clothes with light colors
It appears as if the leather has not been cured or sealed properly. Here are some methods you could use: Vinegar to clean the stains off the clothing. This should disable the stains, but may need a vinegar soak for a while. Using vinegar should not ruin regular fabrics.Using other acids like lemon juice, etc I do not know if work, but they should. Mixing the acid with baking soda should make a sort of scouring powder if you are trouble removing the stain with just the acid. Other methods are:Sealing the Leather again. I was under the influence that leather was suppose to be sealed. By sealing it again you could try to avoid this problem.Also washing the leather before using it. Cleaning the leather a couple of time before using may work.Wearing a light weight  garment over the leather, and in a way to protect the other clothing may work if none of the other methods work. Stains can also be avoided by knowing the composition of the stain:Know if the stain is from dye, normal leather stains or some sort of chemical used to dye or etc the leather?This way you know what course of action to take for stain removal. Dye may not come out easily or at all. 
How to test if a toilet is leaking?
The plumber may mean the toilet tank is leaking into the bowl through the flapper valve found at the bottom of most toilet tanks, at least in the USA. This is the most common toilet leak. To test, you can place just enough colored drink powder, KoolAid mix,(preferably without sugar so as not to attract insects) in the toilet tank, do not flush, but wait 5 min. If the water in the bowl begins to change color, then the flapper valve is leaking.  This is a wasteful and possibly costly loss of water over time. Flapper valves cost from $5.00 to $10.00 and are very easy to replace. Buy a good one. Many are guaranteed to last five years. It takes less than five minutes to change the flapper valve. All household toilet flapper valves should be replaced about once every five years.  Even a small leak can allow an amazing and expensive loss of water. Areas with hard water cause mineral buildup on the flapper valves, or the rubber becomes hard and the valves do not seat well over time.If the leak is in the coupling or feed line to the toilet, or if in the water control mechanism, then it may still be a "do it yourself" job, but a bit more tricky, and wet. If the toilet is leaking around the seal to the floor, then depending upon the age of the structure and installation, it may be a much more complicated job. Again, simplest resolution may be "do it yourself", more complicated could get into heavy plumbing and even carpentry or flooring work. The next best question from you to the plumber is what part is leaking, and from where to where. Discuss that answer here or with your local hardware or plumbing merchant. Or come back here. Most all of us are familiar with toilets in one way or another. :)There is no intent to undermine the fine and high degree of integrity in the plumbing profession, but two opinions are almost always better than one.  
How to test if a toilet is leaking?
As lifehacker mentions, you can check if your toilet tank is leaking in this way (essential info):Put some dye, e.g. green one (anything coloring) in the toilet tankDon't flush, wait for some time.If in the toilet bowl you see colored water, your toilet is leaking, otherwise it doesn't.That's if the leak is small. If it is big, you can detect it just with your eyes :DThere is another way:Mark the level of water in the toilet tank with chalk (slightly above the water level, otherwise water will remove this mark immediately).Wait for some time...Check how the water level in the tank changed comparing to your mark.I suggested marking the water level with chalk, so as you can remove this mark later with water.
How to test if a toilet is leaking?
Remove or displace some water in the trap.  Come back in a while and see if the trap has filled up to the usual level. If you have a plunger handy using it will usually leave the water lever below the usual level.  If the water is clean using a mop to soak up some of the water is also an option.

How to get stains out of the garage floor
You might try laundry detergent before some of the more aggressive methods. Some detergents are made for oily messes and if scrubbed in this could make the oil disassociate with the garage floor. Mixing the Detergent with Baking Soda or salt can make a scouring solution that works on tough stains and even odours. 
Life Hacks for Urine Guard
You could try:Sheet Metal. The type doesn't matter, but makes sure it is thin and the sharp edges are folded over. Holes can be drilled so that it can be hung with wire. You can even buy a sclice large enough to go as high as the animal jumps.Old Vinyl house siding. In some cases the product should have holes already inside of it. This is not large enough, but it is should be cheaper than buying Rabbit Urine Guard if you have some old stuff laying around. Don't use this if the animal chews on the Guard and can reach this, as the animal might eat this.   Hanging the guard on the outside of the cage promoted the pet not eating it. Also, take the animal for walks and make sure the animal is al-right frequently if the Guard is up high.
How to walk through deep snow at a faster pace and keep feet/legs dry as possible?
My suggestions are:Wear panty hose under your pants. One pair should be enough.Wear a light jacket. You will be working hard going through snow and you don't want to get sweaty.Wear polyester pants if possible. Cotton holds more water and should be avoided.Wear one pair of synthetic-fabric socks. Cotton holds more water. Because your feet will get wet, extra socks simply means more water.Avoid leather shoes. If your feet get wet, leather is harder to dry out.Going through snow as you describe will be tough.  Set a nice pace and keep with it. Try not to get hot and sweaty.
Life Hacks for Urine Guard
I suggest getting a strip of cheap vinyl flooring. This is cut from large rolls at stores such as Lowes, Menards, and Home Depot. Because the piece you need is small you may be able to get it for free, or from scraps. The piece may be twelve feet wide, or the width of the roll, but only two or three feet long depending on how much you get.If you obtain a wide piece you can have two or three replacements. Putting it outside the cage will allow urine to run down to the floor, while inside will cause urine to run to the bottom of the cage. If the piece goes to the top of the cage there will be no top edge for the animal to gnaw. If the animal does gnaw the side edge, the piece can be replaced, and the animal should stop gnawing after two or three replacements.
How do I seek justice against vending machines?
Since you say your problem is when [...] a corkscrew [...] rotates less than the distance needed for the item to fall off of the end of the corkscrew.I would recommend shaking the machine, which works in many cases where this happens. However, be warned that this is not a good option, as it can break certain machines (and not just in that one way). (also, if you  do it wrong, you put yourself at risk....but I'll trust that you're smarter than that)As was mentioned in comments above, I would recommend asking the people who run the machine for your money back; they're usually pretty cool with it. I happen to know the operator of the machine in my building personally (hence the above-linked question), so I don't shake the machine, but will usually be able to find him pretty quickly if I need him.
How can I remove the plastic seal inside new coffee jar in its whole?
Personally, I like to use a knife. You can just stab the knife in the packing, right on the edge of the can's circular top. Then, you can just go around the edge of the can, cutting through the seal. This will leave a ring around the top of the can, but you can remove that by cutting a small line in it and then just peeling it off.
Remove ice from freezer / keeping it clean
To remove the ice more quickly, you can open the door of the freezer, put an electric fan heater in front of it and let it blow directly into the freezer. Of course, you need to take necessary precautions not to damage or even burn anything.Others put pots with cooking water in the freeze (again, with necessary precautions), but my experience is that using an electric fan heater is way faster.
How can I remove the plastic seal inside new coffee jar in its whole?
From watching How It's Made, I know that the seal has glue that is heat-activated, therefore, I think the idea of heating it should work. It would have to be pretty hot I think, maybe an iron?
Make suction cups suck
Put a little oil on the suction cup. Oil does not evaporate as quickly as water and also forms a better seal.  In the kitchen, you should use an edible oil such as olive or coconut oil.

How do I read without getting getting a neck cramp?
Though I haven't tried them there are prism reading glasses that might make it more comfortable (something like this, perhaps), or you might try large print text that would allow a more comfortable reading position. Could the issue be tenseness, however? Try relaxation techniques.
How can I remove the plastic seal inside new coffee jar in its whole?
Removing it very slowly while pulling back at a sharp angle works. If it tears, start from the other side. The patience required is almost not worth it.
How to test if a toilet is leaking?
I think the other answers are correct in assuming "leaking" means continual filling of the bowl from the cistern. But in case they're wrong, way I tend to determine if a toilet is leaking from a seal or other joint is to wrap suspect areas in toilet paper. Sometimes sticky tape is needed to hold the paper in place. Then I check on a regular basis to see if any of the paper has become wet. Even if the paper has since dried, it changes consistency after being wet the first time.This is normally enough to narrow down to a particular part of the toilet. It can be helpful as well in distinguishing between condensation-based "leaking" and actual leaking from a joint. Condensation or "sweating" on the outside of your cistern is another indicator that your toilet is continually filling the bowl - the water never has a chance to reach room temperature because it keeps getting refilled when the level in the cistern drops.
Make suction cups suck
You need something that won't allow air through, oil has been suggested and it does work better than water. I'd suggest using some clear silicone sealant on a q-tip (cotton wool bud) around where the cup's edge will be as that will be more persistent. Just a very thin coating should do to close the pores. 
How do I read without getting getting a neck cramp?
Try sitting on a chair, then putting a big cushion or pillow (or two) on your lap. The pillow will raise the book level higher, and you won't have to strain your arms or neck to read it. 
Make suction cups suck
You could also try petroleum jelly. While it isn't glue, it does help with adhesion. You can wash it off the walls. If the wall you are trying to suction cup to can absorb liquid, it is possible that you could stain the wall.
How to see where I've already painted?
Using painter's tape, mark sections of the wall. Start in a corner. When you paint up to the tape mark, remove the tape. The areas that haven't been painted will still have tape on them.

Remove ice from freezer / keeping it clean
I don't know where you live, but if possible, pick a cold evening/night and switch the freezer off. Then immediately pack the contents of your freezer in cardboard boxes, put newspaper on top and close them, place them outside (if you can). If you have freezer blocks (the sort you use in insulated picnic bags) then it helps if you've frozen those beforehand - they can be added to the boxes. Keep any frozen food you know you don't want in the boxes, simply because it helps to keep everything else frozen until you're ready to put stuff back in.Place an old towel or something on the floor in front of the freezer, and for this part, you'll need a hair dryer. First, place a bowlful of boiling water onto one of the empty racks (having removed any drawers and shelves). Now direct the blast from the hair dryer into the freezer, on its hottest setting, until you start hearing ice dropping everywhere. Have a go at removing any big lumps by chipping underneath with a plastic scraper, preferably without damaging anything, then repeat the hair dryer process, and continue, replacing the boiling water as it cools. Last time I did mine, just before Christmas, it was done in less than two hours and everything I wanted to keep from the freezer went back in once it was cold enough again. By the look of yours, its been a while since it was defrosted, so the process may take a bit longer. I'm surprised you've got such a build up of ice in 6 months - mine wasn't that bad after a year. To prevent so much ice forming, it helps if the freezer is kept full, and in particular, with any metal parts which form ice constantly covered with frozen goods.It sounds as is if you have a fridge/freezer - try not to open the fridge at all while you're defrosting the freezer part. In terms of 'cleaning', a solution of Milton in warm water, used to wipe over the entire interior and the door once defrosting is complete, plus cleaning the drawers/shelves, is effective and does not leave any odours that may contaminate food. Wipe the interior dry before switching it back on again. 
How to see where I've already painted?
Since it is part of my job I must tell you that basically there is no way to see that especially in the evening/night when light is poor. Even professional wall painters sometimes miss the spot. There are two things that might help a little: firstly move the paint roller on a smaller distance, when you are done with one strip do not move it to the left or right by the whole roller length, so you wouldn’t create a gap between strokes. Second thing you can do is that during the day you look at celling and mark the spots which are poorly painted. Even those products wouldn’t help you much because they also require some time to dry, and I don’t think that’s convenient for you.
Remove ice from freezer / keeping it clean
A simple approach would be to thaw your freezer more often. By doing that you wont need to leave it off for as long and you wont have as much water to deal with when you do.When you see frost beginning to build up (less than 1cm):Warm up a few towels in the dryerMove your frozen food to the fridge Turn off the freezerStuff a few warm towels in the freezer Wait for 20 minutes or so. As the the ice melts swap the cold wet towels with fresh warm ones.Repeat steps 4-6 as neededThis should speed up the process and eliminate mopping.To slow further build up you may want to check and clean the door seals, if the door isn't making a tight seal it may be allowing moisture in.It's probably worth noting that a lot of newer freezers will run defrosting/dehumidifying cycles on their own.

How can I safely trim my fingernails without a fingernail clipper?
This is difficult to do if your nails are particularly thick or hard, but you can fold the nail back and forth until it naturally breaks off. Your nails also need to be pretty long for this to be manageable, but they must be or you wouldn't need an emergency trimming, right?Be sure to leave a buffer of white, otherwise it will be hard to do and might end up hurtingStart the fold in the middle of the nail then work towards the edges to create the creaseIt might be gross, but lightly chewing on the nail can soften it up to make folding easierOnce the crease is establish, fold the white up and down repeatedly. Take your time with this, so you'll get a nice clean lineThe break will start at the edges and move towards the centerDon't tear it off; that will leave a very rough edge. Continue folding until the white breaks off cleanlyNot exactly a quick process, but it requires no tools and doesn't leave behind any sharp or rough edges. It's also painless and a lot less risky than a knife.
How to make my batteries work for a short time, one last time
If your device requires at least two batteries oriented in different directions, switch the batteries' positions. This will alternate the direction of current and squeeze a little more juice out of them. Not much, but usually enough for 10-15 minutes, depending on your device.For example, in this unit, move the batteries at positions 1 and 3 (numbering from left to right) to 2 and 4, and vice versa.Image from Instructables
Waking up in the morning when standard alarms fail
There's still a chance of ruining your bedding, if you have health problems (or poor control), but drink a significant amount of liquid just before bed time. Your bladder will very insistently wake you in the morning.This will probably take some trial and error to get the timing and amount just right and avoid waking up too early or late, but as long as your digestive system is reasonably regular (and you're well toilet trained), this will both wake you and give you a good incentive to actually get up and moving.
How to see where I've already painted?
Use some strong flashlights for workshops1 and fix the to the wall next to the edges of the ceiling just below the hight of the paint roller.That way you can still paint the ceiling up to the wall but you will have a strong light at a low angle to see where you have already painted. LED-staff-lamps work great because they make a (kinda) diffuse light which I found better when performing this task. You can wrap the LED lamp in white paper if you prefer to have more of an "indirect" light effect.Alternatively: If you paint in straight lines (as you should) make markings on the walls (not the ceiling) with something that is easily removable (e.G. crape-tape). Then when you have painted that stroke remove the marker. I have used something similar (nails) before.Another alternative is to use two red line lasers, like can be found on laser-water-level-bubble (or whatever Wasserwaage is in English) and shift them through the room while you paint. I have not used this myself.1 I'm a regular customer at the linked shop.
Water Softener salt and Dehumidification
I' think what you are saying is you want to use the salt to dehumidify the air, the idea that the salt will turn into some sort of slurry you can feed into your water softener. I'm not sure whether you want the salt to soak up the moisture all by itself, or use an electrical dehumidifier to pull the water out then then use the salt to soak up the water that way. Either way this isn't likely to work well for you. The amount of moisture the salt will soak up is not going to be enough to dehumidify your loft (attic I'm assuming). It will simply cake up and be hard to feed into your water softener. If you use the output from a dehumidifier add water to your salt you will need to modify your water softener (voiding warranties and support agreements), and develop a way to automatically put just the right amount of water into your salt so that your water softener will work properly while disposing of the rest. You then have a makeshift plumbing system with a large tank of corrosive salt water ready to leak all over your house from the top. Try explaining that in your insurance claim. If you have damp problems I'd attack that issue directly. 
How to eliminate rats from kitchen?
Rats are a different problem than mice. Because they are large they present more smell and health issues if they crawl off and die. If exterminating rats it is best to use a rat trap or other device so they die in the open, to be seen and disposed of. Glue traps are inhumane and should be avoided. Poison can be inhumane, but the animal will also crawl away. A rat trap is the most humane method. Methods exist to trap them alive, but few people do that.You will not successfully keep rats out of the house. When present they must be exterminated. If a nearby building or dwelling takes measures, they will go somewhere else and are a common problem in neighborhoods.Having a cat works, but a cat is a pet along with all the responsibilities. If you are already considering having a cat as a pet, it would be an option. The best option however is the rat trap.
How to counteract the burning sensation after eating spicy food?
You should drink milk to counteract the initial pain of the pepper. If you have any burning in your stomach from eating something so spicy, milk should help that as well. Eating bread, rice or crackers will also help quite well. After trying one of these, you could also suck on ice - just to help with the after effects.In summary: to counteract the heat of a hot pepper, your best options are milk or some form of bread or starchy product. And whatever you do, don't drink water to counter the spice, that will just spread the heat around.
How to make my batteries work for a short time, one last time
tbh the best way to awaken dead batteries is to rub both ends (+ and -) of the batteries vigorously on a cloth material, such as a sofa or an arm chair for about a minute.  By rubbing the batteries, static electricity is built up as well as heated up as per @Steve Barnes and can make "dead" batteries last a very long time (up to two weeks of casual use in my experience).  I know this sounds ridiculous but coupled with also changing the position of the batteries, it really can increase the life of a battery for a significant amount of time
How can I get damp clothes to hang-dry faster in the home?
Removing excess water should be done first. Lay out a bath towel with the garmet spread out on the towel, roll the towel up, then stomp on it. That will remove almost all of the water. If most of the water is removed, clothes dry pretty fast anywhere they are hung. Hanging near an air vent helps, too.
How can I figure out which side of the car the gas hatch is on (without getting out)?
If there are no indicators, most people keep their car's manual in the car. The manual should tell you where the gas cap is, though it may be easier to just get out and check than to look through the book.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
Wait a fly to land, then slap hands over it. When your hands start moving, the fly takes off vertically and gets right between your palms.
How can I get damp clothes to hang-dry faster in the home?
If you can afford it, a dehumidifier wins hands-down. 1) your clothes dry faster, 2) moisture is REMOVED from the air, not added, 3) all the energy used (possibly more) is returned to your home as heat.
What can be used in place of a mousepad?
When I'm sitting on the couch with my laptop, I just use the cushion beside me as a pad for my laser pointer mouse. I like it because I'm not limited to a certain area or position of my arm. It requires virtually no pressure, and as long as I keep it on the flat part of the cushion, rather than in the crack between cushions, or on the curved cushion edge, it works perfectly. 
What can be used in place of a mousepad?
My favorite mousepads are soft tablet covers, sold at many "dollar stores". A little doublestick tape keeps them from sliding, if that's a problem. They're easy on my hands.
How to eliminate rats from kitchen?
I've had rats in the house via the kitchen, in the shed and in the garden.   In the house they were getting in via a hole in the cavity wall and emerging from under the cooker.  Using a tip from a professional exterminator you lay down very fine silica sand (or talcum powder) to see the footprints... then lay your traps accordingly.  I tried flour once when I'd run out of talcum powder and they just ate it !!! The pro recommended his bait boxes but I found them to be useless.  "Victor" snap traps (baited with anything or nothing) along their routes did the trick in the loft and kitchen and I scored about 7 or 8.  Snap traps outside will catch other creatures like hedgehogs. We live in a UK terraced house and they were getting in across the open roof spaces and descending thru the cavity walls into my kitchen.  I traced their routes with talcum powder in the loft. They tend to run along walls/boundaries. Outside I have lain in wait with an airgun after scattering bait, but they are very hard to kill even with a direct hit.  Unless you get them in the head or break a leg, they will just run off (and hopefully die.. maybe). Their skins must be very tough and leathery - I have a pump-action airgun that goes up to maximum permitted energy. Then I got the "humane" wire-grid rat trap, which catches them alive.  Baited with mouldy cheese, bread, stale chocolate cake etc... Place the trap along an edge (of the chicken run, garden etc), and just wait.  When you catch one, don't drive into the country and release it. Execute it with the airgun, or drown it.   I am up to rat 19 in the garden since late September. Rat poison in outside bait boxes does work too.  I use the "blue grain" type bait.  I could use several kilos a year around my chicken coop.  The pro's chewy fruit bar bait was ignored inside the bait-boxes in the house. You feel a lot better fighting back when you can see the results in dead bodies. Burn em bury em or bung em on the compost heap. 
Ηow can I keep my jeans' zippers from unzipping on their own?
Shevliaskovic's answer is the classic, but I have a couple to add here as I recently battled a favorite pair of jeans with this problem:Hairspray. spray it on the zipper, the whole thing. It makes it sticker or something. It works for a period, I had to reapply it every so often. This is more of a stopgap to get the zipper through the day/night.Tools. Get a pair of pliers, preferable needle nosed. Squeeze each side of the zip mechanism gently to tighten its grip on the teeth. This is delicate careful work, because you can easily break the zip doing this.If you squeeze it too hard you will make it immobile. If you try to open it back up (use a flathead) there is a very high chance you will simply crack the zip. They are cast metal and they don't like to bend.This worked very very well for me, but once again, use caution.

Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
I'm surprised the following was not yet proposed.You actually don't need any items. Only your hands.But to understand why that technique works we need to know something about flies. As mentioned by others before, flies have almost 360 degree vision, so they will see you coming. but they have one big handicap: They can only concentrate on two things.Knowing this, you can slowly approach the fly from behind with your preferred hand and index- and ring-finger spread apart. With any finger of your other hand you pull back your middle finger. It should look something like this:Your index- and ring-finger touching the surface, you move towards the fly. It will concentrate on those two fingers and won't notice your middle finger. Move your hand really slowly, so you don't scare the fly. When the fly is right below your middle finger it's time for the kill. Just pull away the finger pulling back your middle finger - it will snap down and squash the fly.You will get a dirty finger, though. But when approaching slowly enough this technique works every time.This approach however has one downside. It only works good on flat surfaces big enough to fit your fingers next to the fly.I use this every time a fly lands right on my desk or somewhere near me. I actually prefer using my hands rather than striking with a magazine, since the shockwave of the moving magazine can simply blow away the fly.
How to walk through deep snow at a faster pace and keep feet/legs dry as possible?
Wear the tallest, warmest pair of shoes or boots you have. Socks should, if possible, be a synthetic fiber; if you don't have non-cotton socks, you could wear a plastic bag around your feet and ankles.Wear a pair of pants that are made out of a synthetic fiber. If necessary, you may wear an additional layer underneath.Cut the base off of a large trash bag and then cut down the sides of it (lay the unused bag flat on the table and cut it so that the bag is only one layer and then cut that in half). Wrap a half around each leg, covering the top of your shoe enough for you to rubber band the plastic to it. To fasten the side of plastic, overlap the bag edges enough for the plastic to be slightly snug  but not tight and tape. Now, tape around the top, to fasten to your pants. Preferably, use duct tape (Duck tape); if you don't have duct tape you might be able  to use masking tape overlapped several times.Notes: Any time you have to fasten something to yourself such as with a rubber band or tape do not make it any tighter than you must and be sure you can still slip your finger between whatever the fastener is and your skin.Obviously, if you can, try to walk in shoveled or plowed areas.I hope that you stay as warm and dry as possible!
How to remove ice formation inside the car windows
If you have excessive condensation inside the car you need to dehumidify your car interior... You can use those dehumidifying boxes with silica gel crystals or I have seen a suggestion of using kitty-litter gel crystals knotted inside an old sock and sticking it on your back shelf or dashboard.  I presume the dampness arises from wet passengers dripping water on the carpet/upholstery rather than a leak.  You could try sticking the heater on full blast with the windows slightly open to dry it out on a long journey. My car has an electrically heated rear window so its less of a problem for me.  On previous cars I have used an ice scraper on the inside, but they work less well as the curvature is "wrong" - concave rather than convex. 
How to remove ice formation inside the car windows
Take the largest container of the hottest water you can carry. If the water from your tap doesn't get very hot, consider turning up the max temperature on your hot water heater temporarily. Otherwise, boiling it on the stove might be your better option.Take this container and slowly pour the water over your car window, being careful not to get any on yourself of course.The heat from the water will transfer to the window, melting the ice that's formed on the inside.Alternatively...Take a hand warmer, or a microwaved rag, and wipe the ice away with it. The heat will melt away the ice.
How can I get damp clothes to hang-dry faster in the home?
To keep the water from going into the air and causing problems, you need to get it out first.The best option would be to iron your clothes. Not only will it dry the clothes, but it will keep them wrinkle free too. Also, the iron will use a lot less electricity than what would be needed to heat the whole house.The second best option would be to wring dry the clothes. You can do some by hand, but usually I find that it's hard to get enough pressure on the fabric to press the water out. If you have two rolling pins in your kitchen, you could use rubber bands to keep them together, then pull your clothes through the rolling pins. Otherwise, lay your clothes out on a table and roll the water out of them with the one rolling pin. That should let you apply enough pressure to get the water out.As a last resort, you could use a hair dryer and dry your clothes that way. It's less electricity than heating the house, but I doubt by much when you're done drying the clothes.
How to see where I've already painted?
I took some cheap florescent light fixtures that hold 2 long tubes each, and laid them on the floor pointing up.  Some portable work lights ought to be in your DIY tools anyway.I also added a bit of grey tint to the primer.
How to remove / prevent burns on a shirt from an iron?
The stain you see on your shirts likely are not burns of the textile but discoloured remnants of skin oil or sweat which were insufficiently cleaned by your machine, especially after your textiles could not be cleaned at high temperatures.To remove these stains, and to prevent this to happen in the future, collars and cuffs may need a special pre-treatment before putting them into the washing machine.gently rub in liquid washing lotion to collar and cuff before washing.apply some drops of dishwashing fluid or shampoo (with your finger) to the stains.use bleach only if your shirt was plain white.bile (ox gall) soap applied before washing will efficiently remove not only oil but also proteins left on the shirt.All these may help to prevent staining but may be less efficient in removing them. This very much depends on the detailed compositions of the stains (predominatly oil, more sweat, nicotin stains, ...) so we will have to try out what method works best.From my own experience I had best results by using a liquid bile soap preparation.
How can I speed up putting on makeup?
How long does it take you to do your makeup? I'm not sure about the rest of your routine, but for foundation, I also use liquid and I found it's quicker (and looks better) if I apply lotion first.For your lipgloss, maybe you could get tinted lip balm or something and you could casually apply it in class or work.Also, I'm sure you look beautiful without makeup anyway, so maybe you could get rid of some of the stuff you use :)
How to make my batteries work for a short time, one last time
You can partially recharge certain types of non-rechargeable battery by putting them in a battery charger.  They don't advise this but I'm not sure whether that is because it will decrease sales of new batteries or because it might be dangerous. I suspect the answer depends on the type.   I've certainly done it with the old-syle (zinc-carbon?) batteries. ISTR that repeated attempts have less and less success so its only a temporary fix... 
How to restore Sticker's stickiness?
This may not be a life hack as it describes using an adhesive agent, but it is a great fix for the sticker problem. I am not certain it was designed to fix stickers so this may still be a hack... but nonetheless, here is my answer:Elmer's makes a "rubber cement" which is basically a contact cement. I have used this to create stickers out of normal paper before, but never as a solution to "fix" old stickers.Basically you apply the adhesive to the sticker an allow it to dry. you can then apply a second coat to the backing paper and allow this to dry. once they are both dry you can attach them to one another and the bond will hold. With my home-made stickers I haven't had the need to remove them from the original surface, short of repositioning them when being first placed. I would assume that since I was able to readjust and have the sticker affix itself in the new position with ease, that you would be able to use this method to make a non-permanent sticker fixer solution.
How can I tell if an egg has gone bad without cracking it open?
SourceThrough this method, the approximate age of the eggs can be found. So We can be able to know how long can we keep and which egg to use first.  
How can I prevent condensation on the toilet flush tank?
Try waxing the tank with car wax or other car polishing product. These products often contains additives that help water bead up and resist condensation.
How to remove / prevent burns on a shirt from an iron?
The "sticky" clue makes me think that these are not 100% cotton shirts, but instead polyester or poly/cotton blend.  That stickiness is a sign that you have your heat too high or you are moving too slow.Synthetic fabrics cannot stand high heat like 100% cotton can. To press synthetics and blends, you should use a different technique than on cotton.  One way is to only back off the heat slightly and to work quickly, not keeping the hot iron over any one spot too long.  Another technique would be to back off the heat more and push the iron slower.  This way takes more patience and is not as productive, but it is the safer of the two choices for preventing damage.
How to restore Sticker's stickiness?
To actually make a sticker sticky again without using any kind of tape, the easiest way I found would be using a spray adhesive, as shown here.Another solution would be double-sided tape. But since that is fairly expensive you could stick (pun intended) to plain clear tape. Just roll a piece of clear tape (size depending on size of the sticker) into a loop with the sticky side on the outer side. Then attach this loop to your sticker and then stick it to the surface you want your sticker on. I personally use this "clear-tape-loop" anytime I want to stick something not that heavy somewhere.If you want to remove the sticker sometime later I would stay away from any kind of glue (super glue, glue sticks, etc.) since those will leave glue residues. I actually didn't try the spray adhesive method myself, so I can't tell if it will leave residue as well.
How to eliminate rats from kitchen?
You need louvers because you want fresh air. Fortunatelly, air comes through even small holes, and rats don't.You need to make sure, there are no open holes in your building big enough for rat to come. You could put extra grating behind the louver, or change the louvers to more dense one, so that the rat can't come through (however, you may have problems finding one, so I'd stick to grating).Another solution is to find out how the rats are getting to the window. If the window start at the ground level, there's nothing that can be done, but if it's higher, maybe they use the branch of the tree or some other item nearby?They may use holes in the walls, ceiling windows etc., sealing everything may be a big challenge in an old house, especially wooden one, but unless you do that, you can expect much more 'visitors' than rats only.
How can I prevent condensation on the toilet flush tank?
Most bathrooms have an exhaust fan in them. The fan should be turned on when you start the shower, and it should remain on for at least a half hour after. This will greatly reduce the amount of condensation you have on your toilet.
Is there something around the house I can use to protect/clean my suede boots?
For my suede shoes I use a green scouring pad. They are usually available in a pack of six or so from the kitchen department at the store. They are non abrasive. If necessary, course sandpaper can be used on matted areas with an extremely light touch. Suede brushes are available, too, but I prefer the green scouring pad mentioned.
Is there something around the house I can use to protect/clean my suede boots?
I'm not sure if you would have it around the house, but there are commercial products available to clean and protect suede. This will help prevent it from getting dirty in the future.Since they are already dirty, you can get most of the dirt off using warm water mixed with white vinegar and gently brush off the dirt using a soft bristled brush.
How to remove ice formation inside the car windows
If you have frozen water built up on the inside of your car windows, while keeping your heat on, you can run your air conditioner with the setting that lets fresh air come in. The AC will help dry out the air on the inside of the vehicle and prevent it from fogging up and freezing.
What hack can I use to find a small screw that falls in the floor?
Ah. This is why you should always have spare screws on hand. Fortunately, there is a way...Light MethodMost screws are silver. Shine a flashlight into the carpet and look for little silvery glints. This may take some time, but you'll probably find it. If your carpet is unnaturally thick...Magnet MethodTake a powerful magnet (like a bar magnet, hardware stores - fridge magnets might work) and run it over the surface where you think the screw is. You should find it. If that still fails...Vacuum MethodTake a good vacuum cleaner. Put a sock over the extending arm, and run it over where you think the screw is. The sock will prevent the screw from being vacuumed up, but it will be stuck to the sock. There will still be enough suction to pick up the screw, even with the sock. If not, get a new vacuum! If that fails...Organize your screwsThere are many useful tools to organize screws. Go to your local RadioShack and get one, or make one out of a magnet for that awesome lifehack feel.Stop using carpet![Not a "find your screws" method - a tip about not frying your computer]Carpet can cause static discharge, which is very very very bad for a computer (personal experience). Work on a hard floor with an antistatic strap to reduce the chance of frying your PC.
How to avoid being infected by a colleague
You can use disposable devices that cover your mouth and nose with scarf, veil, face shields or surgical mask while sitting in the office which will provide minimal protection from viruses. Or gently ask him to cover his mouth and nose to not infect others in the office:) BTW. Shouldn't he treat his cold/flu at home?For additional protection, you may use air purifiers on your desk which are capable of capturing a greater number of bacteria and viruses.As for additional precaution, constantly drink beverages (or eat food) containing Vitamin C (remember that it gets washed out of your body quicker than the other vitamins, because our body can't store it).Other life hacks could include buying a full spectrum light bulb which will revitalises office atmosphere by removing micro pollutants and eliminating airborne pathogens, viruses and bacteria (similar to UV lamp which creates a deadly effect on micro-organisms).Other suggestions:ask your mentor for another desk by explaining the situation (tell him, that you're very sensitive to bacteria and when you're infected - bad things happen),when your colleague is away from his desk, hide on his desk a stink bomb, it smell terrible, but hopefully he'll decide to change his desk away from yours.
What hack can I use to find a small screw that falls in the floor?
The best "hack" is the way you look for the screw. Do what pilots do. Move the eyes one section at a time, pausing for a moment, looking at that little bit of the sky. Instead of sweeping the eyes so much, concentrate on the floor in little squares, fully studying each square. This technique works even when the color of the item is close to that of the floor.When this technique is used often, one may begin doing it without having to think, and it becomes much faster.
What are the effective ways to repel mosquitoes without using commercial products?
1. There are some natural etheric/essential oils which have mosquito-repelling power. I know about:lavender oil  citronella oillemon eucalyptus oilsoybean oilThe same fragrances may be in the form of candles, sticks or something else which is usually used for aroma therapy. But I prefer to use essential oil in aroma lamp with a small candle to warm the oil mixed with water, like the one on the picture:There are electric aroma lamps but I have no experience with them.2. Another thing you can try is to put some mosquito-repelling plants in you house or around it. Some of them are:Tan­siesMarigoldsCat­nipThai Lemon GrassCit­ronella GrassGar­licHorsemintAgeratumAn you can find some other plants with repelling action.
How to open camera lens mug without breaking it?
You can try using a strap wrench. They are usually used in plumbing where you don't want to mark something up with a normal wrench like on tub spouts, etc. That should give you a little extra torque without damaging the mug.
What hack can I use to find a small screw that falls in the floor?
I have done this. Lie down on the floor and get your eye as close to the level of the carpet, then look around. You'll have an easier time spotting the lost screw this way because it'll rise up along the landscape of the floor. Bonus points - no extra equipment needed.
What hack can I use to find a small screw that falls in the floor?
Magnet on a tip is not efficient to scan the carpet. Instead, use a sheet magnet to scan the carpet.However, it is much better to think how to not lose the screws rather than how to find them when you lose them.I usually lay a towel on the desk, and disassemble the device and place the screws on the towel. The screws will then be much more stable.Another way to avoid losing the screw is to fix some amount of masking take on the desk, sticky side up, or put a sheet magnet on the desk. Each time you take out a screw, place it on it.

I usually rub my hands around on the carpet. You will feel it when you go over it then you can look in a more specific area. 
Tumble-drying a fitted sheet without getting other things tangled in it
This may sound complicated. What I do when washing sheets is stretch each one vertically, drop into the basket so each stacks upon itself, then put all sheets in the washer without wadding them up. If I put them in that way they tend to stay that way. I wash two sets of king size sheets together at a time, which is four sheets total, in a front load washer. When drying I separate them out and avoid wadding up. I save the sheets so I can wash them together in this fashion, not washing anything else with them. This seems very effective.
How to counteract the burning sensation after eating spicy food?
There are two answers to this. The first, for the holy omg what did I just do to myselfburning, milk and yogurt are the best options, as was mentioned above. The second, for the I don't want to experience that againyou are better off increasing your heat tolerance. First, figure out how hot you can eat and eat but are feeling a burn, whatever level of burn you can handle without needing the first remedy. Then slightly increase the heat and continue until the burn is like it was before. Repeat until you are eating habaneros without needing help to cool. Just a warning, this takes time. It took me about a year to go from jalapeños to habaneros. I started by eating bagels with plain cream cheese and fresh jalapeños mixed in to the cheese. The reason to increase your heat tolerance is twofold. First, you'll be able to taste and enjoy the flavor of what is delivering the heat. I was blown away to find out habaneros are sweet. The second is that the burn, even when you eat outside your comfort zone, will not only hurt less, but for less time. 
What hack can I use to find a small screw that falls in the floor?
I work a lot with non magnetic screws, and even in the case of all the nice preventing tips offered here, I am just a human and from time to time drop them. Having had bad experiences with the vacuum method (some screws just shoot straight through the sock) I took one of the toys of my kids (Its a rolling can with a stick attached), wrapped it in double sided sticky tape, and then rolled it over the floor (carefully making sure that I get through every sector).This has worked fine so far, and despite the tip to stop using carpet, with short carpets this works best, because then the screws don't jump and roll around in the whole room.
How to open camera lens mug without breaking it?
Put it in a bowl of very hot water for 10 minutes to expand the low-pressure air and reduce the suction?  A dishwasher cycle might do it.BTW I got one of these for Xmas and haven't yet used it,  so I could try and repeat the experiment!
What is the best method for cutting the top off a wine bottle?
In the 70's I had one of these http://www.victorialouise.co.uk/bottle-chopper-fun In fact I think it is still in the garage in a box.  Basically an aluminium jig holds a bog-standard glasscutter in place so you can make a perfectly horizontal score on the bottle's outside surface.  Then you adjust a bent metal rod with effectively a washer on the end so that when it is placed inside the bottle it lines up horizontally exactly against the score line. Then you tap the washer against the glass until you see a crack start, and continue tapping whilst rotating the bottle to propagate the crack all the way round. It works well enough, but there are risks of imperfect results if the initial scoring isn't even - e.g. if there is grease/oil/fingerprints on the glass the cutter may slip rather than score. Once chopped, you grind down the edge with wet and dry paper (coarse grades down to flour-grade) or use various grades of carborundum powder on a sheet of flat glass.   A labour of love really but really quite satisfying when it works.  I used to make pint (approx) beer glasses out of Spar orange-squash bottles (all I could afford to drink at uni!).. but boy was the glass quality dodgy?! - you could only tell once chopped - the thickness could vary from 1mm to 5mm.... another reason for failure in the initial chop. 
Best method of getting a wine label off a wine bottle?
According to Popular Mechanics the most effective method was using baking soda and water:Baking Soda and WaterDirections: Three bottles, 16 tablespoons of baking soda and 32 cups  of water, soak for 30 minutes.Results: After 30 minutes, the bucket had two full labels floating on  the top—a very good sign. One bottle required a peel of the main  label, which came off cleanly—and another bottle was good to go with a  simple wipe of the rag. The third bottle, however, proved more  difficult. Although the top label floated away during the soak, the  main label required fingernail peeling and steel wool (although it was  a clean swipe with the steel wool, unlike with the soap-and-water  method).Score: 8 out of 10
How to prevent soda from fizzing upon opening
In a shaken up soda can, the carbon dioxide bubbles form on the sides of the can, not the top. That is why tapping the top is not very effective. A better method is to hit the sides of the can repeatedly. This will knock down the carbon dioxide bubbles. When you open it, it shouldn't explode. If it does, out your finger in the foam flow. This helps the foam and fizz go away.If you are patient, another option is to just let the can sit for 2 to 3 minutes. This always works.Also, don't crack the top fully when opening the can. Slowly open it and let it hiss. Once the hissing stops, there is no chance the soda will fizz. 
What hack can I use to find a small screw that falls in the floor?
1. Listen to where it went.This might be weird but it is my first resort. When you drop a screw, focus on the sound of the screw hitting the floor while keeping your head still. Keep focusing on the sound up to 2 seconds after the sound has stopped.Keeping your head still is important because it makes it easier for the brain to process the sound that has been heard.Focusing on the sound for up to 2 seconds after the sound seems to stop is because the sound doesn't really stop, it bounces around the room and dies out. There is extra information we are not consciously aware of. Just listen without trying to do anything, and the brain will fill in the blanks.Your mileage may vary. If you are very sensitive to sounds I would recommend this.2. Shine a flashlight parallel to the floor.Don't just shine a light, hold the light down at floor level, pointing the beam parallel to the floor. Searching around in this way, when the light hits the missing screw, it will cast a shadow 2–3 times bigger than the screw.
What hack can I use to find a small screw that falls in the floor?
Here is a trick that I used to find tennis balls in bushes when I was younger. This may work with screws as well, but most likely only in cases where you know (at least approximately) the location where it fell from.With the tennis balls this worked in cases where I saw the flight path but was not able to locate the ball in the nearby bushes afterwards.What I did was to throw a second ball into the same direction, as close on the same flight path as the lost ball, but in such a way that I was able to pay attention to where the ball eventually landed (sometimes with the help of a friend). The thrown ball frequently landed near the first ball, allowing me to locate both.With a screw you should use a second screw that is as similar to the first one, as possible. Drop the screw down from approximately the height that the first one fell from, and follow it as it hits the floor. Chances are that it will bounce around similarly to the first one and you can find the first one near where this second one falls.
What hack can I use to find a small screw that falls in the floor?
Shine a flashlight at as low an angle as possible--you want a reasonably dark room and back off a bit with the flashlight to make the angle lower.(Yes, this is pretty much half of qweilun's answer--in a case like this I totally disagree with the listening answer thus I do not feel I can upvote his.)
Waking up in the morning when standard alarms fail
Have a person use a (small, handheld) tazer/stun gun on you if you don't wake up after your alarm goes off - you will quickly learn to get up at the sound of your alarm. and to make it truly a lifehack, the flash circuit from an old or disposable film camera will work wonders for this - charge it up, and then just use the leads from the single large capacitor to give a jolt to the person who can't wake up
Make suction cups suck
You can try using a hair dryer (or heat gun) to warm the surface and air around where you want to place the suction cup - then place the suction cup, and as the air cools, the pressure will decrease, thus creating more suction. 
How to quickly cool off a room without a fan?
Open the windows - use a hair dryer or heat gun if you need to get them unfrozen, and make sure to open more than one - then open the doors in between them in order to allow circulation also, it should be obvious, but wasn't mentioned anywhere yet - make sure there isn't any heating in the room - if it has a radiator, shut the water off - if it has air vents, cover them or turn them off so that your not heating the room unintentionally.

How do I trim my facial hair symmetrically and the same every time
Hunt down someone with a 3D scanner and 3D printer. Get your head scanned while wearing cheap sunglasses.  Ask someone to draw a guide over your face using the 3D model where you want the cut edge to be and join it up to the glasses frame (or overlay the ear and nose part of the glasses frame and join it up with the guide). 3D Print out the guide and join it up with the real glasses (or print out the complete glasses frame and the guide).Pop out the shade lenses and put on your guide glasses and trim away you can trim even in the dark. You could get quite creative with the guide profile and impress the ladies who will think you have a very steady hand.Yay another point for 3D printing (you can do the same with some stiff wire and no 3D printer).
What hack can I use to find a small screw that falls in the floor?
Not an answer but I don't have the points for a comment. When you drop a screw or the like, don't try to catch it. Watch it to the ground and then pick it up at leisure. Of course it doesn't always work, but in my experience it works much better than trying to catch the falling item.
How do I prevent batteries from leaking?
Batteries have greater leak risk the more they are discharged. You might do the following:Keep the item in a cool place.If the item has been used much, replace the batteries before storing even if they have charge remaining.Inspect the item at least yearly.Use reputable batteries since cheap batteries have greater long term leak risk.Do not store an item long term with recharged batteries.
How can I get rid of my sneakers' stench?
Try packing your shoes with newspaper and leave it in there for 2 or 3 days and then remove the newspaper... Then, if u can, put them in direct sunlight for about 3-4 days but make sure when u do - remove the laces and pull the tongue of the shoe as open as u can exposing the shoe to as much sunlight as possible. Oh and if u hadn't already, rip out the in-soles and replace them with new ones 
What hack can I use to find a small screw that falls in the floor?
I'm wondering under what action/posture/position allows for dropped screws? If the fall very near the edge of the table, then a catch-tray around the perimeter will do nicely. If otherwise... why are you holding a screw far away from the workspace? Don't gratuitously do that. It shound be at the workpiece, in the bowl, or under a lamp/magnifier, and nowhere else.If the task does not work that way for some reason, try putting a drop cloth on the floor first. Pick it up from the edges and all awol parts as well as debris collects in the center.
How to "recharge" sodium acetate hand warmer without a stove?
I think the kettle advice is just so it doesn't get into contact with the heating coil. I have a kettle that has a covered coil and it works fine with those, but you have to keep it in there for a while (it still needs a few minutes to completely dissolve, there is no instant solution). Due to inequal heating in most microwaves I would not recommend this, but I don't see anything that should inherently make it not work, other than the piece of metal in it making it somewhat dangerous.If you are that daring dan type and have one of those handwarmers that you don't need, along with a microwave that you don't need I would give it a try and do it on low power settings. The worst that can possibly happen is it popping open and covering your microwave in sodium acetate.
How to remove ice formation inside the car windows
With my precious golf3 I had the same problem, the moist was creeping in and staying there; even though it got away for day or two after driving for hours with AC set on hot (not too pleasant btw.) it kept getting moist all over again. Doing something against this may mean replacing the rubber sealings of your doors or similar, but maybe it is just a one time thing for you, in this case one of the things I tried was:Put some bricks into the oven, set to highest temperature, and leave it there for quite a while. Then quickly put them into some container that withstands the temperature (steel bucket in my case) and put it into the trunk of the car. Removing anything that blocks the air flow (hat shelf, flip over the rear seats if you can). Start car, set AC to really hot, and do not completely close the trunk (just so much that you could stick a scredriver through the gap). If you get the amount of bricks right, it will quickly heat up the back of the car, causing most moist to evaporate. Hot dehumidified air from the AC will enter at the front and leave at the back, drying out the car pretty well. The number of bricks depend on your ovens temperature and your cars size. Do not use too many or you might seriously damage something (a lot of stuff in a car doesn't like anything more than 50°C)
How do you stop headphone wires from breaking?
I use cheapish Sony earbuds - great sound, but they tend to break every couple of years because the soldering inside the earbuds is pretty shoddy. Here's a quick summary of all the advice I've found on keeping headphones safe; most of it is pretty obvious, but sadly I tend to ignore it because HARD WORK IS HARD. Unplug the jack from your player when you're not using it. If you have small earbuds, don't wrap the cable around the player and stuff it in the case or in your pocket, as this puts strain on the jack and may even damage your player at the socket end.Get a headphone case that lets you wind your cables around something. (Here's a list of ideas, some better than others). Don't want to buy one? Take a stiff piece of card and cut two notches in it, one for the jack and one for the earbud/headphone connection. Avoid huge flapping lengths of cable - it'll get caught on things and be painful, embarrassing, and eventually expensive. Pass the cable through your shirt, or under your coat or scarf. For the same reason, always secure your player: either clip the case to your belt, trousers, etc, or zip the pocket tight. Unplug headphones by pulling on the jack rather than the cable itself.Do not sleep on, sit on, fling, or absent-mindedly nibble headphones.Don't follow my example and get headphones with good quality soldering....Or just throw in the towel and go wireless. Tl;dr: most failures occur at the jack end or at the connection with the earpiece. Protect these parts from tugs and strain and you protect your headphones. (And I imagine mid-cable breaks will be less likely as well.)
How do I remove hairs from a caster wheel on a roller chair?
If you don't mind the smell, use one of those:Although being plastic, the material of the rolls is quite thick, and thus doesn't heat up so quickly (Just like the "trick" where you can hold your hand into a candle for a fraction of a second). Just briefly (a second or two) hold the flame inside the wheel and watch the hairs go up in smoke. They burn nicely but smell awfully.Unless you have really lots of dense greasy hair in there, the burning will not harm the rolls. For added safety, have it burn only for a second or two on its own and then blow it of.Scrape of the brittle remainders with whatever you have available ( I used a screwdriver ).Of course do it with all the necessary precautions. Outside, nothing flammable around, a bucket of water in case something goes wrong etc.
How to fry potato so that it becomes crispy without an oven or a fryer?
I fry my chips in two goes:First frying: mid power, let them simmer. You can jam in as many potatoes as you want at this stage, just so long as they're fully covered by the oil.When they're getting nice and floppy, take the chips out, and turn up the stove until the oil is very hot. Put the chips back in the pan, but not all at once! I usually do two batches, so they go properly crispy without sticking together. This stage is much faster.Scarf the lot.
How to fry potato so that it becomes crispy without an oven or a fryer?
If you 'parboil' them first, so boil them for about ~10 minutes - long enough for them to go a little bit soft but not fully cooked and then drain them and allow them to cool for a little while. Also cover them in a little bit of dripping / fat which will allow the outsides to really crisp up nicely.   If you are cutting the potatoes thin enough you can probably omit the parboiling and cover them in a little bit of fat / dripping and then fry them up and they shouldn't take long to cook at all, but the sort of pre-cook process makes the centers cooked so you wouldn't have to wait as long for them to be cooked in the oil.Yet another method is similar to the one you have mentioned - I am not sure how much oil you are referring to but you can make a make-shift deep fat fryer, just fill the pan with enough oil to cover all of the potato cuttings and heat the oil up so it's nice and hot (boiling) and drop in your parboiled potato bits - I've done this after a disaster with an old deep fat fryer and the result was some of the nicest chips I've had, albeit rather greasy. A way top reduce the grease is to allow them to sit on some kitchen towel which should soak up any of the excess oil but does leave them a little cold afterwards.Hope this helps.  
How to remove ice formation inside the car windows
You may need to give the inside of your windows a good clean. Condensation tends to form around the small particles of dirt on the screen. If you are prone to wiping away condensation with a cloth/sleeve etc., you'll be making the problem worse and worse. In cold weather, this condensed water will freeze.So prevention may be better than a cure. Give your windows a good clean and polish and hopefully this problem will occur less often.

There are MANY magnetic sweepers on the market, from cheap to industrial, just search google. They are tools not hacks but if you have a regular need to pick up small metal objects you probably want a tool rather than a hack. this one looks nice though not cheap): http://www.walkermagnet.com/other-products-sweepers-lfs-series.htmIf you want a hack then maybe have at your carpet with a lint roller!
How to remove / prevent burns on a shirt from an iron?
I seem to have similar issues when I starch them. I've been experimenting with lowering the iron temp to avoid melting the starch. Another option, if it seems to be more prevalent on lighter color shirts, try ironing them inside out.
How do I prevent batteries from leaking?
Leakage from batteries, if they are not drastically defective or damaged, results from the normal electrochemical reactions inside them consuming the metal casing and opening a hole. Therefore, the first line of defense — how to prevent nearly all leakage — is to remove and discard discharged batteries. Since all batteries have some amount of “self-discharge”, this means you must change them periodically, but as long as they still have sufficient voltage to operate the device, you're probably safe.If the device has a “soft” power switch, one which does not actually break the connection through the batteries but signals an electronic circuit to shut down, then for long term storage you should remove the batteries to avoid the extra drain of the controller waiting for the button to be pushed to turn on. Ways to tell:If the power switch has two mechanically different positions (pushed in and popped out, sliding/rocking, or just a distinct feel and sound when turned on or off), then it's a “hard” power switch.If the device has control features like an auto-off timer, that don't require you to turn the switch off and on to reset, then it's likely  a “soft” switch.If the device properly uses the IEC standard power symbols on its switch, then the symbols with an unbroken circle ( ) indicate a “hard” switch where the broken circle () is “soft”. (However, the latter symbol is so iconic these days that it has been misused on switches that are actually hard.)If the device has a soft power switch, you can break the circuit inside the battery compartment. The simplest way to do this is to remove one cell (or all of them, but one will do). A fancier trick is to insert something thin and non-conductive, such as a thin piece of plastic sheet, between the end of one cell and the battery compartment's contact, then pull it out before use. (I wouldn't recommend paper, because I've done that and later found rust on the contacts — water absorption? acid paper? Don't know.) Suitably thin plastic sheets can be cut out of plastic retail packages or those little collar-stiffeners in dress shirts.The battery chemistry affects the probability of leakage. I haven't found any reliable comprehensive sources on this matter, but here is the information I have managed to accumulate — if someone could offer some references I'd love to see them.Common alkaline batteries have the highest risk of leakage.Zinc chloride (often called “super heavy duty”) batteries are somewhat less prone to leakage and are cheap but have inferior performance (less lifetime when in use).Lithium-iron batteries have superior performance and long shelf life (low self-discharge), but are generally much more expensive. Lithium-iron batteries are generally highly recommended for infrequent use like you're looking for. (Lithium-iron cells in AA and AAA shapes sold in stores will likely be just called “lithium”, but note that there are many other types of lithium cells which are not 1.5 volts and different in other ways.)Rechargeable cells, such as NiMH (nickel metal hydride), are also less likely to leak because their chemical reactions are designed to be reversible (and chewing up the canister wouldn't be very reversible). For this application you would use “low self-discharge” (aka “precharged”) NiMH cells, and still want to recharge them occasionally. (By the way, there is no need to periodically discharge rechargeables; “the memory effect” is approximately a myth.)(If I were to use my first-hand experience only, I'd say “Alkaline batteries leak. Nothing else does.”)All of the above said, the safest thing you can do is keep the batteries outside of the device. This prevents discharging of all sorts other than self-discharge, and allows you to keep the device and discard the batteries if they do leak. On the other hand, you have to insert the batteries with the correct polarity before use.If you need to insert AA/AAA/C/D-style batteries blind, here are some cues for the proper direction you can find by touch:The positive end of the battery holder will have some kind of “shoulders” sticking out past the contact that are designed to prevent the negative end of a backwards cell (which has no bump in the center) from making contact.Usually, there is one contact which is sprung, and that contact is the negative end, whereas the positive end is rigid. This is not 100% reliable.I wouldn't worry about short circuits — it's hard for loose objects to make a complete circuit (as long as the insulating plastic shell around the cell is intact) in AA/AAA/C/D type batteries, unless you're doing something like keeping them in a box of metal parts. You can be even safer by keeping them in a bag (also handy for less mess in the event of a leak) or wrapped up in a bundle with a rubber band or cable tie (face them all the same direction).
How to prevent soda from fizzing upon opening
I admit I haven't opened a lot of soda cans, but this technique hasn't failed me yet:Lift the tab very slowly and with a firm grip, and stop when you hear a hissing sound start. (There should not be any visible opening at all.)Wait for the hiss to stop. (There may be some soda bubbling out of the top but it won't spray or be enough to spill over.)It's safe. Open the can the rest of the way.
How can I clean an area rug without a vacuum cleaner?
Turn the rug upside down. Roll the rug up, and while rolling, knock the dirt off with a broom, a hand, or whatever works. This should leave all the dirt on the floor to be swept up. Making a large roll will provide a good-sized vertical face for the dirt to fall from.
How to clean out a peanut butter jar for recycling?
Put a few tablespoons of flaxseed meal into the glass and rub against the wall with a wooden spoon. The flaxseed will pick up the peanut butter cleanly. Eat the mixture with yoghurt.
How can I clean an area rug without a vacuum cleaner?
If you have an old cloth lint remover like this or even something made of rubber with grooves such as this pet grooming tool , you can just rub and these will lift tons of stuff out of the rug that you didn't even know were there. I've used both of these on carpets in my stairs.Hope it helps!
How to fry potato so that it becomes crispy without an oven or a fryer?
We have crispy "little fried potatoes" every week with omelettes.  Chop the spuds the size of dice - important to get them all approximately the same size. Different potato varieties give different results/timings. Maris Piper are good. Microwave the diced spuds for 4 minutes in a bowl.  They come out a bit hot and sticky - separate them and add to a non-stick pan with plenty of hot oil over a medium-hot flame and keep turning them. About 6-8 minutes they will be crispy. After 10 minutes they can be TOO crispy/burnt, so watch the pan.  At the crispy stage you can make instant "patatas bravas" by pouring off the excess oil, reducing the heat and adding a teaspoon of hot chili sauce plus as much tomato ketchup as you like to dilute the chili. 
Best method of getting a wine label off a wine bottle?
you can also boil the bottles in a large pot of water for a few minutes, provided your pot is big enough.  When my friends and I reclaim used beer bottles to bottle our homemade brew, this is always how we remove the labels.  The heat dissolves the glue and the paper and the labels literally just fall off.  After you are done, let the bottle gradually cool either by leaving them in the pot with the heat off or by placing them in a bucket with faucet-warm water, this is to make sure they don't crack from changing temperature too quickly
How to cut onion into small cubes?
after pealing and trimming the top and bottom, slice the onion in half along the top/bottom axis. then turn each half flat side down, and make a series of cuts parallel to that top/bottom axis. Make them as close as you want. Then make a series of cuts perpendicular to the top/bottom axis, spaced similarly to the previous parallel cuts.A sharp knife helps a lot, as usual.
Easy way to remove the sticky pages of a book caused by being wet?
Ultimately, the best course is to buy a new one, but if you must keep this one, try this:Get the book wet again. The pages will loosen, and you can dry them out carefully as described here. If you need them flat, you can iron them after they were dry. You can do several pages at once if you want, to save time. Or you can just leave them wrinkled.
How to wash without running water
There are a number of "waterless" skin cleansers, such as Cetaphil, CVS Gentle Skin Cleanser and Family Dollar Gentle skin Cleanser that are more gentle on the skin than soap and water. J.Musser's suggestion of baby wipes is equally valid.
Charge nickel cadmium (NiCd) batteries with a nickel metal hydride (NiMH) Charger
Newer NiMH cells are more resistant to overcharge, but older ones might be damaged if left too long on a NiCd charger. Though they have about the same endpoint voltage on charge, NiCd cells often have a catalyst to recombine the electrolyzed H2 and O2. Newer NiMH cells also have that catalyst and could be used with the NiCd charger, especially if not left on trickle charge indefinitely. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93metal_hydride_battery

How to cut onion into small cubes?
Do it like I do (and Jamie O.) Slice the onion in two. Then, make slices but not cut the onion entirely, so they the ends are still connected. Make horizontal cuts if you want really small cubes. Then, cut perpendicular to the first slices until you are almost done. Then turn the onion (as it will be smaller then the height) so it is flat again. Make your final cuts.

How to waterproof your shoes?
The easiest way is to polish your shoes with wax.Rub the beeswax over the entirety of the shoe. Use dishwashing gloves or rubber gloves to keep your hands clean.If you don't have beeswax, use the candle wax.When finish, optionally you can use your hair dryer (with high heat) to eliminate the whitish color (so the wax will melt into material even deeper).See also:(video) How to Make Your Shoes Waterproof by CrazyRussianHacker
How to fix a dented ping pong ball?
Place the ball in a kettle (with water) and boil it. The air will expand in the ball and pops out any dents.However, I find they are never quite the same again due to minor imperfections. Often best to just buy a new ball.
How can I get rid of my sneakers' stench?
Your previous attempts have failed because they haven't actually killed the bacteria. The alcohol method will work however I have found freezing them over night, let them thaw out. You can then wash them after this process if necessary.It's very important that they are 100% dry before freezing otherwise you risk damaging your shoes. 
How to eliminate rats from kitchen?
Treat them with SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) - controversial toxin available in most commercial liquid soaps, gels and shampoo. It is toxic to bacteria, animals as well as to humans.First of all clean your louver and its close areas. Then spill a lot of some SLS liquid (the cheapest - the better) where you can (e.g. on outside part of your window), leave it to dry and check the results. They'll hate it.
What hack can I use to find a small screw that falls in the floor?
If you can't find it in the white light with help of magnet, try at black light. Switch off your lights (or wait till dark) and use UV lamp to find it. To your bad luck, most of the silver screws does not glow under black light (it is not a fluorescent mineral), but hopefully it'll differentiate with your carpet color.Who knows you can find there else:)Alternatively put a stocking over the end of a vacuum tube and hoover it down.
How to clean out a peanut butter jar for recycling?
To help you get the remainings more easily out of the glass, there are silicone scrapers available in different shapes and sizes. They work quite well. Actually it works a lot better than you could do with a knife or spoon. Afterwards it should be clean enough for recycling.Here's an image:For the purposes of recycling glass you don't need to wash it perfectly clean. A small amount of fat doesn't do much harm to liquid glass (probably it will just burn and be gone at some point).Here's a quote from a website on the topic:http://recyclingweek.planetark.org/recycling-info/how-clean.cfmSmall amounts of food left don’t interfere with the glass and steel recycling process. Scrape all the solid food scraps out of jars and cans and then put them in the recycling bin. If you’re concerned about having left over food in the bin you can lightly rinse out your jars and cans. Using left over washing up or rinsing water is best as there’s no point wasting good water just to wash recycling. If the jars are to be reused by some food producer (e.g., returnable containers) they will have better and more efficient cleaning processes than you have for cleaning their input material.If you want to reuse the jar yourself, that's a different story though.
How to cut onion into small cubes?
Place it on the board as it stand. Slice them top to bottom like parallel ways then cute them to smaller :)
How to counteract the burning sensation after eating spicy food?
You may try to eat raw ginger as it has a powerful flavour that you can easily forget about the spicy food and burning sensation. It has also powerful anti-inflammatory properties and stimulates digestive juices and the flow of enzymes that help you digest your spicy food. In some parts of the world, ginger juice is applied to the skin to treat burns (so this is what you need right now:)As interesting fact, ginger in sushi is used not only as a flavour-enhancer, but it also used to kill the acquired taste between the portions.For neutralising bad food from your stomach, try to take some activated charcoal which will absorb toxins without overworking your liver.
How to counteract the burning sensation after eating spicy food?
Normal heat beats spicy heat. Put something temperature hot (but not scalding) on your tongue. It will hurt more for one second and then the chilli pain will instantly be gone. Things like a hot piece  of flat bread will work fine.
How do I safely clean a laptop using scuba gear?
Needless to say, this is not a good idea. A SCUBA regulator is life safety equipment. It is designed to supply air to a diver underwater. Simply put, it keeps you alive. Using SCUBA equipment you intend to dive with in this fashion is highly inadvisable.But let's ignore any personal safety concerns for right now. Could you do this, as you propose, without damaging the laptop in the process? Probably not. Your typical can of compressed air produces pinpoint blasts of air. A regulator second stage, on the other hand, is anything but pinpoint. It has a wide mouth to maximize flow rate. You could probably do it, but it wouldn't be very effective. It'd be only a little more effective than using your own lung power.But the second stage regulator isn't the only way you can use a SCUBA regulator to deliver pressurized air. You also have the low pressure inflator line. XS Scuba manufactures a combination tire inflator/air nozzle that connects to a standard quick-disconnect hose. (You can find the catalog listing here). Let's say you were using that little gadget. Would you be able to safely clean your laptop then? Probably, but even this isn't ideal. From experience, a device like this shoots air considerably faster than a typical can of compressed air. You could regulate it to some degree by only opening the valve partway, though, so this could be a way to do it. You can also manually open the Schrader valve in the low pressure hose with a small screwdriver or something similar.I am not even going to discuss methods that involve removing components of your regulator setup. If you are not a technician, do not take your regulator apart. Remember the part where you're working with life safety equipment? If you don't know what you're doing, don't take things apart.
How to cleanly cut cake into even slices
A very good method for cutting anything from cake to bread to cheese is to use dental floss. You can run the floss through the cake and it will allow you to get a precision cut. This is very quick and leaves clean cuts. It is also very easy to get even slices. I do not own this. From InstructablesYou can also use other thin wires such as:Fishing lineString Sewing thread
How to tie a tie?
There is a "ninja" knot-tying skill demonstrated by CrazyRussianHacker user on his video.Here are the simple steps:Put the tie on the table with thick side to your right and the thin side to your left.Twist both endings to make a loop.(tricky part) Grab the loop from your left (thin side), twist it and put it under the right loop Now grab the shorter side and put it through both loops way down next to thick side. Grab the main looped part and pull it on both sides. Adjust it based on your needs.Done.It needs some practise, but once you get use to it, you'll be amazed with the results. If few years old kids can do it, you can do it either! 
What can I use to hang my headphones off my desk?
Are you against putting holes in the edge of your desk? Two finishing/trim nails could work. Hammer them in close together (horizontally spaced) so the cable just fits between the nail heads. Most (micro) USB connectors shouldn't be able to slip through, and the cable will just dangle there. I recommend finishing nails because they have thin heads, but any nails that you can put close together (while keeping a small space between the heads) should work.The headphones simply hang from the nails themselves. If they are prone to slipping off, you could angle the nails a bit upward to create more of a "hook". If you're not sure what finishing nails look like:
How to fix a dented ping pong ball?
similar to @Duncans answer, you can pass a lighter flame over the ball a few times.  it will heat up the air inside and pop out the dent.  be careful not to hold the lighter on the ball for too long or else it will melt the plastic.  Also, it should be noted that this method and @Duncan's will not work if the ball is dented to the point that the plastic has cracked and allows air to pass between the inside and the outside.  I'd also suggest just to use a new ball but in a pinch this will workSource:  beer pong in college
How do I make a wobbly keyboard key stable again?
I"ve had to do this more times than I would like to remember.  It's very difficult to explain but I did find this as well as a video.  See the bottom.  Good luck to you!From Laptop-keys.comHow to fix laptop keyboard keys for the Dell Latitude D610If your Dell laptop key is broken or missing, you have come to the right place for all resources to fix or repair your laptop keyboard key. Rather than spending hundereds of dollars on a new keyboard, you will find that replacement laptop keys is cheaper and easier to do. Here, we will give a quick tutorial on how to replace the laptop key on your Dell Latitude D610. This is a supplimental guide in addition to the video installation instructions above on you to replace your Dell Latitude D610 keyboard key: Now, to install your new Dell Latitude D610 latop key, begin by orientating the retainer clip in the proper direction of the keyboard. Typically, the small plastic feet on the plastic hinge will be spaced appropriately for you to determine which direction the plastic parts go in relation to the metal hooks on the keyboard base. Observe the laptop key retainer clips carefully and notice that the smoother side will always face up, additionally, the plastic feet on the laptop keyboard key retainer clip will always face downward to allow the hinge to fit into the metal hooks. Once the retainer clip is situated correctly, lock it into the metal hooks on the keyboard base, it is always easier approaching it from one direction and hooking in the plastic clip than another. If one direction does not work, try the other. Now the laptop key retainer clip will be securely attached and ready to accept the plastic key top. If the laptop key is the type with the metal supporting bars, those will need to be inserted into the matching metal hooks as the laptop key cap slides over the plastic retainer clip and before it is pressed on. Once the keyboard key is positioned squarely over the retaining clip, press down gently until you hear a distinct click on all 4 corners. This indicates that the key cap has been secured to the retainer clip correctly. Pull up on all four corners gently to ensure that this happened correctly. That's it! You have successfully completed a repair on an individual key for the Dell Latitude D610 laptop key.Here's a video from youtubehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-cl=84411374&v=i2t40LRgb9A&x-yt-ts=1421828030
How to avoid butt-dials on phones where the keypad is always exposed?
Get, or make, a case that covers the buttons. Cardboard or cereal box and duct tape should work well, I would make it thick so that button presses can't make it through. Use colored duct tape if you want a more refined look. 
How to avoid butt-dials on phones where the keypad is always exposed?
This may seem obvious, but possibly place it in your FRONT pocket, rather than your rear?Perhaps the looser pocket in the front will eliminate the pressure on the keys?Outside of that, the user manual indicates these steps for locking the phone (different from your method described with the back button):(Screen shot above is from page 91 of this document)

How to heat your room efficiently?
In my university dorms the students were forbidden to use electrical heaters ostensibly for safety reasons. The dorms did have hot-water heaters but they were barely sufficient. We tried using old computers, vacuum-tube televisions, etc. but the device which really warmed the room best was a complete surprise.By leaving the refrigerator door open and moving it to the center of the room, the room would heat up comfortably and would stay warm. No other method of heating the room even came close.For completeness of this answer, if you live in a damp environment then a dehumidifier provides >100% electrical efficiency in heating its surroundings.

How to keep water from boiling over?
The most common life hack is to put a wooden spoon across a boiling pot of water to keep it from boiling over. Set it and forget it!Few tips:it depends what are you boiling (e.g. pasta, soup) as it won't work with only plain water pot,it really depends on the spoon and how much wood surface area you'll give to the water (the more, the better),it can make a difference to put the spoon on it earlier,if you deliberately turn the heat all the way up just to test it, a single spoon could not help here.Why does it work?The theory behind how does it works is that the wooden spoon breaks a surface tension of the bubbles and it's also not a very good conductor of heat, so it helps to cool the bubbles off when they reach the surface.In other words, when the foam bubbles up it will eventually meet the spoon. The foam is thermodynamically unstable, which means when the bubbles reach the spoon they will burst, breaking the layer of foam and sending all of the bubbles collapsing down again. [gizmodo]Alternatively just use the bigger pot with higher walls to climb.Here are few videos demonstrating a wooden spoon method:Use a Wooden Spoon to Keep Water from Boiling Over - Jazzy Gourmet Cooking StudioHow to Stop Water from Boiling Over TrickHow to Use a Wooden Spoon to Stop Pots from Boiling OverKitchen Tips "Wooden Spoon" Stop Water From Boiling Over

How to heat your room efficiently?
Something similar to your tea candles solution would be toilet paper roll, rubbing alcohol and an empty paint can (as explained here). I actually saw this method in a video some time ago, but can't find it anymore.Steps to take, to make above mentioned things into a heater and even a stove:remove the cardboard tube from the toilet paper roll1.1 you can either cut the cardboard with a scissor or peel the cardboard where it's stuck together, like this young man explains, and then pull it out.squeeze the toilet paper into an empty paint can (you can also use two toilet paper rolls, if your paint can is big)fill the paint can to about 4/5 with rubbing alcohollight up the toilet paperThe toilet paper functions as a wick, so all the rubbing alcohol will be burnt. Also the paint can will stay cool in the lower half, so you're still able to move it around.Stove:To turn your heater into a stove, simply place three bigger paint cans (or any other heat-proof objects) around your heater. Now you can put a Pot on top and you're ready to go!
How to locate pinhole cameras planted in a room?
According to Instructables it's easy. You should use the same method as for locating field spiders! Huh?Get a tube.Find a tube that's good for looking through. A cardboard tube from a roll of toilet paper or paper towels is best.Get a flashlight.All you need is a flashlight or something that you can use to focus a beam of light in a dark room. Attaching a couple of directional LEDs to the outside of the cardboard tube can work also if you don't have a flashlight.Look through it.With one hand, hold up the toilet paper tube to your eye. With your other hand, hold up the flashlight at about eye level and point it away from you. With one eye, look through the tube and scan the room. If there are any small points of light bouncing back, inspect it further. It might be a camera.

Easy way to remove the sticky pages of a book caused by being wet?
According to wikiHow, there are the following 4 methods:Method 1: Slightly dampRemove as much liquid as possible from the book by taking it out of the puddle and carefully shaking off the liquid.Blot the affected pages, preferably with a towel (cloth, not a paper towel).Assess how much of the book has gotten wet. If a certain portion is still dry, insert something between the wet portion and the dry portion to prevent the liquid soaking the whole thing while you prepare for the next step.Plug in your iron. Turn it to a very gentle setting (silk, for example) and wait for it to heat up. Turn off the steam.Place your book on your ironing board and carefully single out a wet page. Be careful not to tear it.Take a piece of absorbent paper like a paper towel (or a piece of toilet paper)and place it on your wet book page.Place your warm iron on the tissue and move it carefully from side to side. If you can't do it without creating wrinkles in the tissue, press it down, then lift it up, set it down a little to the left or right of your original spot, and continue.Check the page under the tissue to see how dry it is. Repeat the former step until you achieve your desired dryness.Continue with this method until you have dried all affected pages of your book. Use new pieces of absorbent paper for every page, as needed.Method 2: Soaked - If your book falls into some water and it's floating.Check carefully the position of the book while it floats and attempt to catch it gently. Place your hands inside the water beneath the book and lift it as not to rip up the frail paper.If the book is completely soaked, trying the method above will rip the paper. If even the cover is wet you should put down the book on a warm and clean surface. Good options are a boat's deck in the sun, a balcony, a car's hood or concrete floor, if you watch it so that no one else picks it up.Try to access the extent of the damage by trying to flip the pages of the book. If you can see the next page's writing through the first don't pull them apart.Flip the book every so often, to ensure it dries throughout.When the pages are tough enough to read as a regular book but it still feels moist, you may try the first method used above for smaller amounts of liquids.Method 3: Using a hairdryer. This works well for both for damp and soaked books.Carefully smooth out the pages.Dry on the high heat setting 10 centimeter (3.9 in) away from page on slow dry.Method 4: Making rabbit ears.This method helps air circulation and prevents pages from sticking together.Fold each wet page corner, 2–3 centimeter (0.8–1.2 in) toward the center of the page, without pressing on the loop that formed.You can skip a page every now and then.Repeat for both "open" corners or just one corner, depends on the level of dampness.Leave to dry.
How to get rid of smell from kitchen trash?
According to this article titled "how to get rid of trash can smell" it is not an easy task. Recommended to get rid of the odour listed in order of effectivenessCleaning up the trash can with soap and water, using a hose outside,leaving the can in the sun to dry. Sunshine will kill themicroorganisms that cause that trashy smell.Use Charcoal The article suggests some chunks of charcoal in a small area will absorb the smell. Baking soda also a good absorbent of smell in a small area.The article gives some suggestions for masking the scent at the source, which might be answers to the OP request for something quick and EZ.Trash Can Smell MaskingIf you can't beat them, hide them; that's the whole idea behind  perfumes and some such products, isn't it? The methods below basically  mask the smell with another more powerful odor rather than remove the  smell, so you should be sure you are going to be happy with the  result.Vanilla Essence: Pour several drops of vanilla essence on a couple of cotton wools. Toss the cotton wools inside the confined spaces  nearest your trash can. Leave them for several days and you will  notice that the area smells nice, or at least smells nicer.Lemon or Lime Peels: Just put some lemon or lime peels into an uncovered container and leave them inside the confined area for a  couple of days. The citrus smell will naturally replace the bad trash  can smell.Mint Extract: If you favor neither the smell of citrus nor vanilla, you can perhaps use mint extract instead. Pour several drops of mint  extract on a couple of cotton wools. Toss the cotton wools inside the  confined space and leave them for a couple of days.Coffee: Ground coffee has a nice, crisp natural aroma. Just put about a cup of ground coffee in a flat, uncovered container. Place the  container inside the confined space for several days. If the bad smell  is extremely horrible, put more ground coffee. The area will smell of  fresh coffee for many days.Tea: If you don't like coffee, you can use tea bags instead. Just place 2-3 tea bags inside the confined space. The tea leaves in the  bags will not only absorb the trash can smell but will also release  the natural aroma of tea.Orange peels: Get an orange and poke it with a sharp object like a needle or fork to form small holes. Place each of the cloves inside  these small holes until most of the orange surfaces are covered. It  may look like a hedgehog with the cloves jutting out of the orange  fruit. Leave it in the confined area for a couple of days. The area  will smell nice with the said combinations.Pandan Leaf: It is easy to get pandan leaf in tropical countries as it is widely used in Southeast Asian cooking to add aroma to dishes.  Its pleasant aroma also acts as natural air freshener. Just take a few  strips of the pandan leaves and tie them into knots. Place the leaves  inside the confined space and leave them until the leaves are withered  or dried up. Replace the leaves regularly until the trash can smell  goes away.

In lighted situations: Wrap electrical tape around the base of the earbud and the wire, using a different color for each side. I would suggest red for right just for the mnemonic device. Taping is good practice, anyway, unless your wires are fabric-wrapped.In dark situations: Put a drop of high-temperature glue - super glue is probably OK - on the outside stem or shell of one of the earbuds and let it dry completely. You'll be able to feel the bump with your fingertip.
How to keep water from boiling over?
Most of the time when you need boiling water you don't need to keep it at a rolling boil. I've found that the best way to keep things from boiling over is to reduce the heat slightly, so while the water is still boiling it's not quite so vigorous.That, or you can try using a larger pot when cooking.
How to heat your room efficiently?
In greenhouses it is common to use black water-filled containers to absorb heat from the sun in the daytime and re-radiate it at night. If you are after a solar solution and have the sunlight it might be possible.  Alternatively - is your hot water fixed-price/included?
How to keep water from boiling over?
I agree with not keeping the water at a rolling boil, if it doesn't need to be, and if you get into a really big pinch, and the recipe can take it, throw in some salt. The salt increases the water's boiling point and will stop the water from boiling. 
How to keep water from boiling over?
Here is a method that involves butter that may help the problem:Rub a bit of butter around the top of the pot. You will need about 1/2 tsp, more shouldn't hurt the food.

How to get hair out of a brush
According to Anithamallya’s blog and madefrompinterest article, few interesting comments and adapted instructions, you should follow these steps:You need toothpicks, scissors anything small and flat that can get through the bristles to the base of the comb to get all the hair out.Taking some scissors, cut the hair in the brush lengthwise down every 2nd or 3rd row making sure you are  cutting in between the bristles.Taking the tip of the scissors, slide the scissors lengthwise underneath the hair and lift.  The hair should lift right up.  Continue until  all the hair has been removed.Optionally use the hose attachment on the vacuum cleaner and I vacuum the rest of the hair off the brush.When most of the bulky hair has been removed, set your brush in a sink that has some warm water mixed with a small amount of shampoo or dishwashing liquid.Alternatively  use white vinegar along with shampoo and baking soda. Wet brush, sprinkle with baking soda, and pour about 1/4 teaspoon, 1 teaspoon of white vinegar over baking soda. Leave it for 15 minutes. Or if you don't have white vinegar, put baking soda or ammonia in a tall glass, add a brush and combs, then add boiling water and let it sit. Taking a spare toothbrush, scrub/brush vigorously up and down each row of your hair brush and also all around the top.Set on paper towel to dry.
How can I keep my phone from falling over when watching videos?
In this answer I am going to assume you have a iPhone, smartphone or other gigantic looking phone that would fit into this mechanism. Actually many phones may fit into it, but the designs I saw are mostly for larger phones. Picture taken from primermagazine.com.Use a Mini DV case. If you turn the case the wrong way then the phone can sit either sideways or straight up without falling out. These can be decorated or you can make them into a dock for the phone.  Picture taken from instructables.com.Use Binder clips. You will need a larger clip and smaller clip, by taking the smaller clip and bending it upwards as much as the larger plastic or metal portion will go without breaking it and then inserting the smaller clips long metal arm like extensions in the mouth of the larger clip up to its metal or plastic body.  Additional InfoWhen in doubt use a paper clip. This method seems sort of fragile so I declined to add it in a conventional answer. Use Legos. While this link shows only a simple design, you can do wonders with Legos.And like the other answer suggests use a card. Or business card, perhaps?For additional ideas see the following links:makeuseof.comgeeknaut.comlifehacker.com- This one uses iPhone packaging, Binder Clips and tape to make a awesome case.

How to heat your room efficiently?
I have a 1500 square foot cabin with Vaulted ceilings and a loft. The Fireplace is helpful, but when the fire goes out, it gets cold and fast.    The thing that has helped me most is realizing 2 things: Anything can be a heat source. I have a million candles, most of them picked up cheap, then re-melted and put into metal bowls. Of course safety is paramount, so they are strategically placed and sit on River Rock. Fire-Metal-rock all seem to retain a lot of heat, and Yes, I did a lot of experimenting with Reflector Pans as well, cheap covered dish stuff from the grocery. I rarely have to turn on a light as well. That Being Said, Most Importantly, I have a 3 1/2 ft crawl space under the house. After I put thick plastic black trash bags cut to cover the ground, I put in insulation against the floor with a staple gun. I should have used landscaping plastic instead of Duct Tape and trash bags, but there is a 100% change regarding the Hardwood floor. No more house shoes or thick socks. I like the alcohol/paint can idea as well. I do wonder if Paint Cans are thick enough. Worth a try. Sounds like a bunch of dudes with dude answers, we all have a little pyro in us.
Reduce the laptop weight falls on shoulder when carring
What might help you is:Adding cushions to your backpack or shoulder bag straps. This can be done by getting softer straps or sewing softer materials into the strap, also making the strap broader helps. The broader the strap the more the weight is displaced, there are usually devices for this already on the strap.Get a waist belt. A waist belt for your back pack helps it support the weight instead of just lying directly on your shoulders.Usually a shoulder bag has more than one handle, it has a longer shoulder strap and a shorter hand strap, by using both of them you lessen the weight directly on you shoulder. Also, switch sides that hold the bag frequently and avoid narrow straps, try broader padded ones. You may want to invest in a new back pack that is made to hold a appreciable amount of weight. This way the backpack is stronger and more comrfortable.  Fitting you backpack.hartchirocenter.com The backpack should fit so the bulk of the weight is transferred from  the shoulders to the hips and lower back. Shoulder straps that are too  loose can cause the backpack to dangle uncomfortably, and cause  misalignment and pain.Choose a backpack with a lumbar support. The lumbar cushion will  redistribute weight to the lower extremities, creating a fulcrum that  facilitates an upright standing position and good posture that is  essential for proper spinal health.
Prevent cables and wires from twisting
The simple answer is to untangle them and be careful when adding and removing cables. When you first plug everything in, make sure the cables aren't crossed. Move from left to right or top to bottom.If that isn't sufficient or is too much of a pain to remember there are a few additional things that you can do to keep things straight. For cables that you routinely add and remove, consider using one of the methods here to keep the plugs from falling: How can I keep cables from falling off of desks when unplugged?Coil and secure cables that are longer than needed. You can use short lengths of velcro as removable cable ties.  Double sided velcro (hook on one side, loop on the other) can be found in most fabric stores, sold in spools or by the yard. Consider securing cables to the underside of your desk.You can use thumbtacks or screws and lengths of velcro to secure cables to the underside of your desk like this:Or you can make a similar arrangement using binder clips:
How to start fire with wet fire wood after it has been raining or snowing
Water usually only penetrates the outer layers of dead wood, so your best bet is to use a knife or hatchet to strip away the damp outer layer.Gather some kindling, dead wood that is about as wide as your finger or less.Pine will usually make a great fire starter, the sap/resin is flammable after it is heated.Use a sharp knife/hatchet to strip away as much bark and wet wood as possible.If you can use a hatchet to split larger pieces of wood into kindling, this will expose the drier inner layers.Start a small fire using the stripped kindling.Use the small fire to heat and dry the larger pieces. It will put off a lot of steam/smoke, but the smoke should subside after a few minutes.It will take a bit more time and effort to get it going, but once you have a nice bed of coals established you should be able to keep the fire going even if it starts to rain again.It is probably worth mentioning that there are some solid fire-starters that can be safely carried in your pack.Magnesium Bars.Use a knife to shave off a little pile of magnesium and you can start it with a spark. Magnesium burns at a pretty impressive temperature, but it doesn't help too much with damp wood because it tends to burn pretty fast.Paraffin wax.This is my favorite. It burns hot and slow, it also repels water so you don't need to worry about getting it wet. Many brands of cheap paper cups are coated it a thin layer of wax and make excellent fire starters.
How to reduce the air humidity in a room?
Use a dehumidifier.  These work very well in damp basements and should serve the same in a kitchen.You could also consider using the dryer for your clothes or choosing a less humid room in which to dry them.One final option would be to turn the heat up a bit.  Warm air can hold more water, such that it should reduce the amount of dew on the windows; it may also warm up the windows and decrease amount of condensation.

You can lay out some rice on a plate. This will reduce your humidity.
How to start fire with wet fire wood after it has been raining or snowing
Dryer lint is also highly flammable and is great to keep to help light your kindling. In scouts we would make fire starter kits with dryer lint in a bag to keep it dry and also cardboard rolled up inside a tuna can and then covered in paraffin wax. These should hopefully burn long enough to light the wet wood. On a side note, I've also seen people carry road flares to light fires with. If a flare won't light a log, probably nothing will.

Pest Control - Natural Method of Ant Control - Howto
We sucessfully banned ants from our home by using baking powder.Unlike us ants will explode from bubbles produced in their intestines when eating baking soda. But this will take enough time for them to carry soda fragments to their mates and their breed which will then effectively kill those as well.The place we put quite huge piles of baking soda (2-3 spoons) was where their trails came out of the wall. We repeated the procedure for 2 times until no more ants were visible.Years later we still don't have any more ants which makes us believe that traces of soda they carried away still serves as an effective biological ant-blocker, provided there is no moist in the regions they carried it to.
Remove staples from a hard board
You could try:Using pliers(or a similar device) and a pair of wire cutters. By cutting the staple in half, you can pull up either side easily. You can use the pliers to just pull the staples up. This is easier on staples that are not close to the board. Pulling directly upwards is key. Using a screwdriver to loosen the staples helps in either method. You can simply take a flat head screwdriver and put it under the staple and then using it like a lever pull upwards. Once the staple is a little bit up, you can do either method that is named above. 
Pest Control - Natural Method of Ant Control - Howto
You could try:Diatomaceous Earth- The particles basically get inside of their bodies and cut them up.  Sprinkling this stuff down wherever the ants are sited works and wherever they go.I have heard that borax works as well.Essential oils- Using a strong oil like peppermint, Tea Tree oil, etc around where the ants are sited works. It suffocates the ants(It may suffocate them, all I know is that it kills them) and works on other bugs. 
Remove staples from a hard board
Depending on the type of stapler you have, it might have a staple remover 'wedge' at the back of it which I have found to be very useful in removing staples from almost anything.  This image shows sort of what I am talking about (not the best image but the best I could find at short notice) you just slide the little piece of metal underneath the staple (might require some jimmying) and then use the stapler as a sort of lever and lift the staple out from the board.I have also used a few different things in place of this when it hasn't been available:  ScissorsA pen (not a crappy Biro that will just snap but a decent strength one)A knife / fork / spoonScrew driver (flat head works best)Basically anything strong and flat that would fit underneath the staple and you would be able to use as a lever to remove the staple  You can buy special tools similar yet separate to the one shown above:Hope this helps.

Ants apparently won't cross a line of chalk / powder. If you use a standard block of chalk for a black board you can draw a nice solid line on the ground and it will stop them completely in their tracks.  You have to make sure that there isn't any gaps in the chalk line as they will find it and go through it but so long as your line is solid they'll be kept at bay.  You can also use a powder in the place of the chalk which will have the same effect (baking powder tends to work well)Another option is you can apply double sided sticky tape, or you can get special tape designed for stopping ants and other critters and this will literally stop them in there tracks and they will be stuck there until you decide to do what you will with them - gives you the nice sense of being God in the world of ants.On a side note - if spiders are also a problem, if you know where they come in (cracks in the wall or doors) if you place a nice pile of conkers in the way they'll be deterred from coming in. Works and can look like some decorations if you're into that natural decor type stuff.
How to reduce the air humidity in a room?
Ensure you cover your pots with lids when cooking, whenever possible. This can dramatically reduce the amount of steam that escapes into the house. Also, ventilation is crucial. Modern houses tend to be very well insulated and one of the consequences is higher humidity. Try to at least:Open kitchen windows/doors to clear steam after cooking (some will escape, even if you use lids)Open bathroom windows after baths or showersConsider leaving a window ajar if you dry washing.In general, consider opening more windows around the house. The downside is you'll need to have your heating on more often to combat the lowered temperature.Final note: if you get mould, make sure you spray it with mould killer. Simple water/soap will just spread it about.
How do I avoid paint crusting around the top of the paint can?
One solution I've heard is to stretch a rubber band length-ways around the paint can so that it crosses the top of the can (like a diameter). One can remove excess using the rubber band and it will drip downwards into the can without messing up the edges.I'm yet to put this in practice though, so happy to hear other solutions and comments as to whether this actually works.

Fastest way to boil water?
Use electric kettle (it takes only 1-2 minutes to boil the water).If it's still too long, use the microwave for around 30 seconds to 1 minute (on high power). But be careful as water boiled in a microwave oven can suddenly "explode" (including your mug). And for safety please remember to choose the right a microwave-safe container (such as glass, ceramic, paper plates, wax/parchment paper) as microwaving in metal container (including aluminum) can produce sparks which can damage the microwave or even start fires.For microwave method, we can read the following steps at wikiHow:Pour the water into a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Place a clean, microwave-safe object in the water (a non-metallic object such as a wooden spoon, a chopstick, or a popsicle stick).This prevents a dangerous problem called "super-heating" by giving the water something to form bubbles on. It occurs when water in a microwave heats water past its boiling point but the water is unable to form bubbles because there are no nucleation sites, causing a small explosion of boiling water (read more: Boil on Troubled Waters).Put the water in the microwave. Heat in fairly short (no more than 1.5 minute).If sterilizing the water, keep it boiling.Check How to Boil Water in the Microwave for further details and safety tips.
How do I avoid paint crusting around the top of the paint can?
You can use masking tape over the edge of the pain tin - still using the edge of the tin for  wiping the paint on but once you're done you will be able to remove the masking tape and discard it and you'll still have a nice clean paint tin rim.  Masking tape is something a lot of people have in their home and is available in a wide variety of stores so wouldn't be too hard to obtain.It's much like painting skirting boards - people use masking tape to keep paint from running onto other surfaces that you don't want painting and at the end you can just pull it off and you'll have a nice neat edge to your painting!
How to boil an egg using an electric kettle without a mess?
I saw a method on instructables that involved tilting the kettle to help the eggs avoid hitting the heating element which would cause a nasty mess - however I don't think that one is a good solution as it could vastly depend on what kettle you are using.  I've given the link up top just in case anyone is interested in this method and would like to give it a go but it go me thinking about another idea which would allow the eggs to avoid the heating element at the bottom no matter the position / size.What you will need:One (or more) egg(s)One electric kettleOne tangerine / satsuma / clementine / orange netting (or any other netting that would be a suitable substitute.A piece of string or a small stick (a couple of strands of spaghetti might do the trick)  Now the idea here is we are going to put the egg into the netting and try and suspend it from the top of the kettle, allowing it to bathe in the boiling water while staying clear of the elements at the bottom of the kettle.  The string method I would wrap the egg up like a Hershey's Kiss and tie the string around the top of the netting and then tie it to the handle (better if the handle is over the top of the kettle) or even just get it to the right height and shut the lid and the egg netting should remain suspended in there until you think it is time to release it.  The spaghetti / stick method would involve leaving the lid open, it will be kind of like making a hammock for the egg. Push the spaghetti though one side of the netting (probably need to bunch up the ends a little) and then placing the egg in the middle of the netting allowing it to rest there (much like a hammock) and you can place the spaghetti across the open kettle allowing the 'hammock' to be suspended in the water and once again, avoid the heating element at the bottom.Note that using spaghetti may not in practice work. This is because the steam coming from the kettle might cook the spaghetti and make it weak and saggy which is why something else thin and stick like may work in place, or use many spaghetti strands to delay the cooking time.Something else that I have just thought of after looking around my desk is you could use a mesh pencil pot of something similar to act as a cage which would protect the eggs from the kettle's elements but may present a hazard of itself as it might shake around a lot which could crack the egg. Just a thought.
How do I remove USB's plastic fragments from the USB port?
I know that you have already accepted an answer, but I wanted to add something that might prove useful for other users who might not have tweezers or such things.Blu Tack. - That's all I really have to say on the situation, get a nice big bit of Blu Tack and press it on the area you want to remove the broken bits from (push fairly hard in order to get it really in there) and then just pull off the afflicted area and it should, depending how wedged the bits are, bring out all the bits.I find Blu Tack so useful for picking up small items and cleaning the odd dusty area - it wouldn't cause any damage to the USB port as there aren't any hard or pointy elements to it that could potentially damage the port. The only possible problem it could present is that you would get Blu Tack stuck in the  port as well as the existing mess. BUT GUESS WHAT: Blu Tack will be able to get that stubborn Blue Tack out - a few quick presses and releases of the Blu Tack should see you Tack free in no time!Hope this helps anyone in the future!
How can I keep my desktop computer's cables neat?
Cable Ties. - This is what they are designed for really. Got lots of cable that you need to keep together neatly and tuck them all out of the way? If you have lots of wires and cables going to the same place (i.e. the back of a PC) you can just grab them all together and stick a cable tie around them (you could even use string which would have the same affect) and then you can easily move the cluster of cables out of the way in one chunk rather than having hundreds of different things trailing around the place.Tie knots in long cables - If you have some cables dangling around the floor or on your desk that are really long and wind all over the place - think about tying them in a knot to firstly reduce the length of the long wires and secondly help in keeping them untangled from each other. Follow this link for a cable knot that prevents tangles.Instead of knotting you could simply fold and then tie int he middle with string, tape, or cable ties.Use labels - You can use many different things for labels for organizing which cable belongs to what. You could use adhesive labels, bread tags (as mentioned in the other answers), masking tape, string and a piece of paper, also colored tape like electrical tape. My personal favorite would be the color coding - you could make a key that would remind you which wire belongs to which color and then you won't have to worry about writing really small or ink rubbing off.Use old credit / membership cards - Much like the bread tag and clip binders, cut some holes in an old credit card or membership card (would be easier to use a hole punch) and then cut a slit to the edge of the card so you can get the cables in, you can then have multiple wires parallel to each other and you could even write one the card what each cable is, below is a picture that gave me this idea which is from MakeUseOf.I hope one or some of these are of assistance, slightly better than my first answers as well I hope!
How do I stop my cables from getting tangled inside my box?
A nice method from kenorb, however I personally never keep my toilet roll tubes laying about the place and never think to save them for anything in particular - poor planning on my part I know...A method I have tried before when moving electronic goods around (i.e. when moving out to University or something) I have simply put the individual cables in a nice loop and sellotape around the middle - keeps them from running free around the place and helps to prevent tangling. Much like how the cables come in the packet when you first get them - must be done for a reason right?The cable in the middle is what I am trying to describe...I also used large sticky labels which I could wrap around some of the thinner wires (charging cables and such) and I could then write what electronic item they went to, which made unpacking and reassembling much easier. Using this idea string with tags attached would also be a neat method but you might just get the string caught up instead of the wires so something to think about!

How do I avoid paint crusting around the top of the paint can?
There is a commercial solution to your problem; look for "paint can pour spout" on Amazon.The idea here is that you put the plastic lid on top of the open paint can, and it gives you :a pour spout you can use to decant the paint into another containera hole you can put the brush in and wipe it on the side of the plastic lid, not the metal paint can.Once the paint dries it's easy to peel off the plastic lid.I have one and it works great. 
How do I avoid paint crusting around the top of the paint can?
I used to paint for a summer job and the way we were trained was to never wipe the brush on the top edge.  Just dip the tip, and don't wipe off the excess (there shouldn't be excess); did this just yesterday at home and still works.  When the can is not full you can tap the tip against the inside of the can such that the lip is never paint covered.Another thing to do is shake the paint can to mix it.  Don't use a stir stick as it makes a huge mess (and can get paint on the lip).In short, address the problem at the root - don't get paint on the lip of the can.

How to stop rim of water bottle becoming smelly?
Don't let it touch your mouth while drinking.Wash it with vinegar to help further remove the smell from bacteria. This will also, to an extent, help prevent bacteria from building up again as quickly.Don't leave it somewhere warm, such as near a furnace vent. Bacteria grow best in warm, dark, and damp places, which also leads me to...If you don't wash it at night, open it to allow it to dry as well as possible. Dryer equals less bacteria growth.
How I prevent my computer from collecting dust?
You can use any type of textile from an old pair of tights to professional HEPA filters, as long as the surface is big enough to let a sufficient amount of air through. Therefore you could maybe create a long mesh tube, apply the filter material around it and roll it up in order to get the largest possible surface within the smallest volume.  I think there is no way you can reduce the amount of dust by some chemicals, as they would have to get in direct contact with the dust particles. So smearing some glue onto the fan grid will not have much effect.But you could possibly increase the humidity in your room to reduce the amount of dust flying around. This however would also affect you yourself.A possibly more effective but also dangerous idea of mine would be to build a box with two metal capacitor plates that can be charged with static electricity (you would have to buy some electronic parts and do some soldering). This would draw the dust onto the plates while the air passes by. However, you have to make a case around it that is connected to the ground to shield the outside from the electrostatic field. And you will have to put it in some distance to your machine, connecting them with maybe some kind of paper/textile tube with wires in it to make it keep its shape.However, the easiest way is to buy some prebuilt dust filters. For example, there are filter panels with magnetic or adhesive tape to place directly onto the fan grids.
How can I stabilize my feet in my oversized boots?
Things you could try:Put something in the toe to stop your foot from moving around, things like tissue, Newspaper or clothe work. For clothe use water wicking and odour reducing if possible. Soft objects like sponges work better, as it is more healthier for the foot.Something I have tried is putting something harder in the shoe and then something softer to protect the foot. Tie the shoes tighter if the shoes are to wide. How do you fit into shoes that are too big?Try using some of these inserts to fill out the extra space in a shoe  that is too big. For instance, moleskin pads at the heel can help keep  a foot from slipping out of a pump with a heel that's wider than your  the foot. Gel insoles can raise the foot inside the shoe, reducing the  amount of vertical space in a shoe that is too big. Additionally, the  user may be likely to find that walking and standing are much more  comfortable.You could try to shrink them, but this will not work with the type of shoes you describe, probably:Spraying with water and then letting sundry or using a hair dryer usually works.You can sew elastic bands in the back of the cloth shoes.

How to get hair out of a brush
Kenorb's answer seems very thorough but, if you're OK with the results not being perfect, you can use my method: Scrape it out with a fork. The tines get between the brush bristles easily and, by grabbing it in 3 or 4 places at once, it's much more likely that you can pull out the entire hair instead of breaking it or slipping loose. I strongly recommend that you wash the fork before eating with it.Source: I've done this and it totally works, even on dog brushes.
How to fix a keyboard with a missing leg?
You could break off the other leg so it lays flat. This isn't very ergonomically friendly, however, so I would recommend then adding a long, solid support or two identical supports at each end. The advantage to breaking off the other leg is that now it's easy to get the keyboard level. Trying to make a wedge the same height as the remaining leg is bound to leave you a little wobbly at the end.

How do I avoid paint crusting around the top of the paint can?
I always wipe off the excess on the brush on the side of the can - but when I've finished, I take some kitchen roll/paper and wipe round the edge of the can, removing any paint still lurking, including inside the rim on the top if there is one, before replacing the lid. If its oil based paint, I will follow up the kitchen paper treatment with a disposable cloth lightly moistened in white spirits to clean it off properly. You can use scrunched up newspaper instead of kitchen paper, but it doesn't work so well and is a bit more messy to do.

You can get some reusable adhesive putty (example shown below) and take a small piece for each leg, and press it into place. Then press the keyboard onto your desk. It won't wobble. Because this is reusable, it's easy to move somewhere else if you ever need to. The biggest problem is dust accumulation over time, which mean that you may occasionally need to replace the putty if you don't like how it looks.  
How can I stabilize my feet in my oversized boots?
I always buy my hiking boots either 1/2 to a full size larger than my foot.  The reason I do this is to create a buffer between my foot and the shoe, reduced blistering, more aeration for evaporation and cushion.What I do is use two to three cotton socks or two wool socks.As a hiker carrying relatively heavy packs for long distances and multiple days, I've found over the years that many others do this for the same reasons.Aeration - Assists with evaporation as your foot squishes and compresses the sock while walking it creates more circulation and accelerates evaporation.Cushion - I've had many ankle injuries from motorcycle crashes to climbing accidents.  The extra cushion really helps my situation.Reduced Blistering - Due to less moisture and rubbing, considerably reduced chance of blistering.  If your on day 2 of a 5 day hike and you get a blister.  You have 3 days of suffering and misery ahead of you.  As well, a Dr Scholls insole or boot insert rounds out the package.  It takes up space and provides and excellent cushion which is better for your ankles and knees.Hope this helps.  Best of luck. 
How to open a frozen car door?
Avoiding the condition is helpful although not always possible. This door freezing happens when the outside of you car is warm enough to melt the snow that is falling. It maybe that it was a warm day, or more commonly your car got some sunshine that melted some snow or ice on the car and then it refroze when the water found the cooler spot in the deeper door recess. It is the same process that forms icicles were sun melted ice or snow migrates to a cooler spot. So keeping your car out of the sun on a cool day will help prevent this.Often you will find that just one side of your car suffers, so like you tried the passenger door may not be so iced up. You should also try a back and forth movement on the door to try and break the ice some. Pull the handle, push the door in with your hip, repeat. Also do the same thing around the window frame. Don't push so hard or pull so hard that you damage your car. ( I discovered this remedy when I was late for work)I suggest you avoid any kind of water below 15 degrees or so. Always avoid hot water, glass will break. But if it is not to cold, a cup of water may work.
How to remove snow from a roof
Ladder and shovel is the only way. It is dangerous especially on a pitched roof. Do not attempt to wash it off, especially if you are worried about structural problems, the snow will absorb and freeze a lot of water adding a lot of weight before any snow is removed.Look at your weather forecast, if it is going to be warming up above freezing a lot of the snow will be melting rather quickly. Ice dams can be a problem, but they are not an immediate problem, they just put a lot of wear and tear on your roof over the years. If you are worried about ice dams clean the snow off your over hangs to minimize the problem. Some ice dams around vents can cause leaks, that only leak in the winter, those are a problem that need to be addressed in the summer time after the snow is gone by an expert, I suggest calling a pro or search in the DIY SE for a solution. At any rate your problem is one of weighing the risks of getting up on the slippery roof against the risk of structural failure or injury from snow falling off the roof.If you have enough room around the building you could devise a small plow on a long handle and pull the snow down. This will be easy on new snow fall that is rather light and fluffy, older snow falls that have packed down and become crusty may not be so easy.
How to increase humidity indoors
If it is possible you can place a pan of water on the radiator. A friend of mine did this and also added a little potpourri to the water and it made the room smell nice, as well as added to the humidity. Use and old pan, a lot of water scale tends to build up over the course of a winter season. This  also works well with wood stoves.
How to remove snow from a roof
For a pitched roof, a snow rake should be sufficient. Though Amazon offers one for ~US$50, http://www.amazon.com/Garelick-89421-21-Foot-Aluminum-24-Inch/dp/B0000BYCD5/, you could devise something as effective for less; the picture in the ad should help. Instructables has directions, http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Snow-Ripper-Rip-snow-from-your-roof-in-minut/.Climbing a ladder in snow is risky, and there is increased risk of electrocution from gutter defrosters, lights and other snow-covered wires. It might be necessary for a flat roof, but not for a peaked one (unless you live on Hurricane Ridge or Mount Rainier, which can get 20 m of snow. :-)
How to open a frozen padlock
Use a hair dryer. The warm, dry air from a hair dryer is perfect for melting ice. Depending on how frozen the lock is and the outside temperature, it may take between one and five minutes, if not longer.Then spray the lock with WD-40 to help prevent it from happening again.
How to increase humidity indoors
Maybe it's time to invest in a good humidifier (buy/rent)?Maybe a bit smaller, but you've got the idea:)If you want to pass that one, maybe it's time to wash your clothes and set up a drying rack in your room and lay out damp clothing to dry overnight. You'll save energy by not running the dryer, but adding more moisture to the air, all while adding the fresh scent of laundry to your room. Or you may decorate your room with bowls of water (place a few around your house and the water will evaporate into the dry air). Also don't forget to drink a lot of water.See:How To Add Moisture to the Air Without a HumidifierMakeshift DIY Humidifier
How to open a frozen padlock
To add to the other answer that may not be as accessible due to the length of a Hair Dryer cord, here is what I do:Wrap the lock in your hands and breathe on it. Use your hands to insulate the heat in. This usually opens it, and I usually take it somewhere warm to thaw out and apply the WD-40.Other methods are if the lock is pure metal is to put a fire(cigarette lighter, etc) directly to it. The below link says to use a mug of a hot beverage. But from experience the hot liquid will be steam and if the weather is cold enough, this will turn to ice when it the lock. But if hold it close enough and have some barriers around it to protect against wind then it should work. How do I open a padlock after it has frozen?
How to amplify laptop speakers?
I affected sound output on my laptop by downloading a sound amplifier program. Search Google for "laptop amplifier download". Try several to see which works best. Run downloaded files through https://www.virustotal.com/ before installation to make sure they're safe.My experience was pretty good. Output was probably fifty percent increased, but some of the sounds flattened out indicating the circuit was being over-driven a bit. Such does not cause damage, but volume may need to be reduced slightly to sound better. The one I used was trial-ware, meaning it worked for awhile with an occasional pop-up annoyance, then required payment. I chose to get cheap speakers, wanting better sound quality, and uninstalled the software.You can try setting the laptop on its side in an attempt to direct output where you are sitting, which helps.
How to hard-boil an egg in the microwave safely?
You can immerse the egg in a mug of water so that heat is transferred in more slowly; I've done it when no stove was available. It's not necessarily a time-saver, though.BTW, whole potatoes can also explode unless pierced many times, I have found to my regret. It produces instant mashed potatoes -- all over the oven.
How to open a frozen padlock
If you have a high-proof alcoholic beverage (not sweet; sugar will gum up the works later), that can work as deicer, but dry out the lock afterwards.
How to organize things/books in a packed shelf?
The big problem seems to be the assorted wires, devices, and similar, that you can't stack very easily. I would recommend putting them in a box or boxes, so you can stack other things on top of them, and it's easier to put them somewhere else (under the bed, say), without too much hassle, and without makes things untidy.I would also recommend putting any loose papers in a ring-binder if they can fit vertically on a shelf, or a box file, which can stack, or go vertically. Smaller manuals could also go into box files for protection, and to keep related ones together.Basically, if everything is stackable and easy to move, that should help you use the space more efficiently, and make it easier to rearrange. Also, make sure stacks are level. I don't like the look of the book underneath the black box on top of the shelves, it could make the box unstable if you put anything else on top of the box.Those are the main things I think you could do.
How do I store frozen sausages, so they are easy to separate?
Aside from the obvious - freeze them separately, each in their own bag - you can freeze them with plastic, baking paper or fat-free paper in between them. Don't use plastic that's too thin (like the plastic foil you use to keep the food fresh), or it will just tear off when you try to separate the sausages leaving all bits of plastic in your food. And don't use aluminium foil as well, as it tears way too easy, and you will find yourself peeling the bits, or chewing aluminium (although you could just get the last bits out when the sausage is already in the pan).As moisture will attach a little bit to plastic and meat, the sausages will "stick" to each other anyway, but it will be significantly easier to separate them.If your it is still a bit hard to separate them, drop them on the counter, or help gravity a bit and smash them with force. Not brute force though, your counter or sausage will break. Or neither will break but your sausages will fly around the kitchen.And whatever you do, don't squeeze your to-be-frozen-food too hard together.NB: yes, you do have to get them out of the original packaging...
How do I remove hard-to-remove ink from my hands?
Depending on the type of ink, you might try oil-based hand cleaners such as Goop or acitrus-based solvent, or an alcohol-based solvent, such as isopropyl rubbing alcohol. Though it's very hard on the hands and can damage clothing, dilute bleach works for ink-jet stains.
How do I remove hard-to-remove ink from my hands?
You can try using some removing it using certain alcoholic products such as alcohol wipes, nail polish remover, paint thinner. However stronger product such as the pain thinner is not as recommended. Nail polish remover or the alcohol wipes are the best choice though if you have. 
How to make sure cabin luggage will be within the size restrictions?
One method is to use a board which has about the same size as the front of the suitcase, a spirit level and a tape measure.Put the suitcase next to a vertical wall and make the front touch the wall.Put the board on the other side of suitcase parallel to the wall.Make sure the board is exactly vertical by using the spirit level.Depending on the shape of your suitcase it might also be neccessary to check by tape measure if the left and right edge of the board have the same distance to the wall.Measure the distance between the board and the wall. That's the maximum depth of the suitcase.Repeat for heigth and width, if neccessary.In case you don't have a spirit level available, you can check the verticality also by using the tape measure as in step 4.
How do I store frozen sausages, so they are easy to separate?
If you remove them from their original packaging which makes them quite tightly squashed together and them pull them all apart (no need to cut them individually just so that they're no longer squashed side by side tightly). If then you go ahead and put them in a Tupperware box or even a sandwich bag or something and don't squash the bag again or at least make sure that they aren't squashed together in the box and then put that in the freezer. They will probably still stick together but as they won't be as squashed and tight so they'll be relatively easy  to separate (just some minor pulling apart).To reiterate:Remove the delectable tubes of meat from their original packaging'Unsquish' (patent pending) the sausages and separatePut sausages in a bag or box (I would go for box to offer more anti-squash protection)Make sure they're not squashed too tightly togetherPlace container with sausages in freezer and try to keep from being squashed by other things in the freezerRemove sausages when desired and pull apart - leave any you won't be usingEatJust so there is no confusion, when I say separate the sausages I don't mean cut the string bit that connects them all together I just mean pull them apart from each other so they aren't touching as much, you could just pull them so they're in a straight line so you know that they aren't touching and then put them in the container. (although cutting the connector will probably make removing from the freezer easier).Doesn't require any extra 'tools' and doesn't take long.A fun other method that made myself laugh, because I am that sad, straighten the sausages out in a line and then line the edges of your freezer with them - it'll be a bit like decorating at Christmas but with sausages and instead of a tree, it's a freezer. Ha.
How do I store frozen sausages, so they are easy to separate?
I don't want to elaborate obvious and simple things, so I will just cut to the chase: When you buy them, take them out from original package, separate them, put them on plastic salver or plate and put it in a freezer. After few hours, or tomorrow, you just take sausages and put them in a plastic bag, so they wouldn't take as much space as they would on the plate. I have tried it, works every time. No need to worry about squeezing them, because once they are frozen they are solid as a rock.
How to amplify laptop speakers?
Even more important than volume, when it comes to sound quality, is bandwidth (the range between the lowest and highest frequencies that can be reproduced by an audio system).Even if they have excellent sound cards, built-in speaker subsystems found on laptops –even those of expensive macs– usually have bad performance at the lowest frequencies, because they are too small.And if you put some plastic on top of them, you are not only redirecting the sound towards your position, but in the process also cutting the higher frequencies, or even introducing some distortion due to vibrations. But you are in no way "amplifying" sound.It's simple, lower frequencies require more power than higher frequencies to perform at the same (audible) volume level (that's why sub woofers are much bigger than than satellite speakers on home theaters, for example).You don't need to buy an expensive (>100 USD) set of speakers or home theater; even a cheap set of amplified desktop speakers (~5 USD) will sound a lot better than plastic cup halves vibrating on top of your laptop. But if you can afford a 2.1 set (with a decent sub-woofer, ~30 USD) just don't hesitate, it's an extremely huge difference, and you'll really start to enjoy audio quality.
How to amplify laptop speakers?
Invest in audio speakers (Audio Jack or USB), that's the easiest way.If you don't like wires, try Bluetooth speakers.Alternatively you can use the touch/induction speakers which boosts the volume of any device with an external speaker. Place the device close to an external speaker for instant sound.How does it work? It's grabbing the magnetic field of the speaker using induction, and then running that signal into its own amp and speakers.If you're after hacky hardware solutions, try to make your own induction speakers as it doesn't look so complex.See: How The Mysterious Boost Connection-Less Speaker Works
How to make sure cabin luggage will be within the size restrictions?
Here are few tips:organise your stuff as evenly as you can,put some items between clothes to not waste extra space when they're next to other items,use the extra space between and next to handles underneath the bottom (if present),if you're taking extra shoes, use extra space inside them,place small items inside packets of your clothes,use external hand luggage pockets to store some narrow items,if you're taking any boxes (like gifts), fold the box so the item will take less space,take as many items you can on your person (they're not weighing people)take small heavy items from bag into your trousers/jacket pockets (e.g. cables, chargers),dress yourself using the heaviest clothes you're taking with you (e.g. multiple trousers, sweaters or jackets) as usually clothes take the most space),hang on your person any wearable items (such as cameras) - they're not extra bags,if items are not wearable, use strings and wear them hidden under your jacket,hold in your hands any trouble/big items (such as umbrella, laptop) - they're not bags as well,take an extra backpack on your arms, because:you can put big and heavy staff there as usually they don't check/weight the backpacks,when spreading out your staff between 2 bags, it's better than having one big bag with suspicious/unusual size,most airlines accept small hand-bags (such as backpack), because you can put them under your seat,backpacks are less visible,try Apple bags (with strings), they're almost invisible in the front, so they won't ask you about something they won't see,if you're going with a friend, ask to do the same as above (fill their pockets with extra staff as well),when you're with a friend, go to the check-in desk separately looking after each other's bags, they won't check/weight something they don't see,when going to departure gates or security clearance always choose the way with people who look nice and easy, or check how they treat other passengers before moving forward (statistically usually man-woman, woman-man rule works, so if you're man - go to woman and smile nicely),be self-confident, walk fast, passively follow crowd, not distinguish between persons, don't exchange staff eyes (be for them another millionth boring, ordinary passenger),always keep your risky bags behind you and far from the staff who can think about your bag and stop you,if you see bad timing in the front of you, ask friend to distract staff by asking for gate number so you can bypass staff as fast as you can,when they ask you to measure your bag and it's too big or too heavy, repack or go to the next gate and try again,always remember that at security gates they don't care how big/heavy your bags are, the only risky places are at the check-in desk and departure gates.
How can I amplify the speakers of my iPhone?
You can amplify your mobile speakers by using induction speakers which boosts the volume of any device with an external speaker without any wires.How does it work? It's grabbing the magnetic field of the speaker using induction, and then running that signal into its own amp and speakers.If your purpose is different and you want to make as much noise as you can (e.g. you're a heavy sleeper), then put your phone into a glass/mug.
How to cut onion into small cubes?
Turn the onion so that the tapered side sits to your right and chop off the right and left ends (vertical cut) and peel the onion off by removing the outer skin. Set the onion on one of the flat sides and cut it into thin slices vertically.Cut each slice separately by making a grid (cut it horizontally and vertically). You can use few slices of the same size at the same time (on top of each other). Usually most of the onion will come apart in layers that make nice arches. When all slices are cut, perform extra chopping.Now you've perfect small cubes.Alternatively use the grate and chop it at the end.Related:How to Cut an Onion at wikiHow
How to protect computer from accidentally pressing the power button?
Anyone with a toddler knows of the unexpected mass destruction that can rain down when your two-year-old somehow figures out how to infiltrate your massive security barriers and somehow hit that little black button only moments before you save a weekend's worth of online shopping selections.Never fear; there are some precautions you can take short of moving that tower out of the way of accidental engagements. Cover the ButtonIn the truest sense of a "hack", this idea from IKEA hackers talks about using a refrigerator lock to protect your power button from such risk:Move the ButtonBelieve it or not, it's actually quite easy to move your power button to a new location. Devices like these allow you to simply unplug your existing power switch from your motherboard and move it off to a more-secure location. If you're a bit more industrious, you can take your existing switch and move it yourself.Get a More Secure CaseThis may be a bit more heavy-handed than you are looking for, but there are cases that have front covers which are designed to hide the external workings underneath.Enjoy!
How to protect computer from accidentally pressing the power button?
I have just covered the button with a piece of cardboard (~3" square) and used masking tape to secure the cardboard onto the case. This may leave some residue, but is essentially free.
How do I clean gold and silver ornaments?
Silver tarnish can be removed electrolytically by putting the silver object in an aluminum container (e.g. an aluminum foil pie plate) with water with baking soda dissolved in it. The silver must be in contact with the aluminum and completely covered by the salt water. Warming gently speeds this up. It should be cleaned as you watch in less than a minute!This sets up a "battery" (well, cell is the singular) and short-circuits it, causing the sulfur in tarnish to migrate to the disposable foil pan (which looks mottled gray afterwards). It won't do much for cleaning skin oils and other dirt, though; you'll need a toothbrush and elbow-grease for that.Caution: do not use on niello or lacquered articles, as it will damage the inlay and finish.

How do I clean gold and silver ornaments?
Seltzer water(carbonated water)Put your ornaments into seltzer water for around 5-10 mins and brush them. Ex club soda or cokeHouse hold dish wash soapsSoak the ornaments in warm water for 5 mins and scrub with toothbrush using dish washing soap liquids.Using toothpasteThis is very common method and I've used many times. Just apply tooth paste and leave it for a minute. Then scrub with tooth brush and rinse.Ammonia and VinegarI heard they are also good cleaning agents, But I have never tested and not sure how frequently we can use. You can use it on your own risk. I am sure these will affects the ornaments which has pearls and stones with glues. Mouth freshener ListerineI have tested this also and worked very well. Just put your jewelery into the liquid and scrub with tooth brush after 15 mins. TamarindIndians knows the benefit of tamarind. This is widely used to remove thick and strong tarnish. Just soak the gold in tamarind water for 10 mins and brush it. (off topic, rub some tamarind on brass to make it sparkle like gold.)TIPS:If your ornaments has gemstones (rings, pendants, etc) avoid using warm or hot water or chemicals. This will not affect the metal but loosens the adhesives glued in. Avoid brushing silvers with brushes having hard bristles and long time, It will scratch the silver. P.S: Your method of baking soda and hot water method is not recommended. It involves more work and care. Usually aluminium foil has to be placed under or wrapped. This is being done to move the oxidation formed on the silver to aluminum foil, Else this method will not be effective and may turn the ornaments black. 
How do I store frozen sausages, so they are easy to separate?
I do this with lots of foods that are hard to separate after freezing. I roll them in plastic wrap and then put them all in a baggie in the freezer.-- I place a hotdog on plastic wrap, give it a roll, add another, roll, etc. fold the ends over. Then I place in a baggie in the freezer with the date. I can then easily unroll as many sausages, hot dogs, etc. as needed and put the rest back. There is only 2 of us most of the time and I find we have less waste.

How to make sure cabin luggage will be within the size restrictions?
Please Please Please do NOT be one of those people who have to big of a carry-on. It's very annoying for those who travel frequently to be delayed because of luggage being stuffed in overhead, having to find space, having to check it instead, etc.What we do, is pack everything we would take in that bag, and perhaps a bit more. Then we check to make sure it isn't bulging out anywhere, and is still relatively flat. We then measure again to be sure that it meets the requirements of whatever airline we are flying on. I also carry a big tote bag as my purse that still fits under the seat. That helps a lot.Enjoy your trip!
How do I store frozen sausages, so they are easy to separate?
The best way to store sausages is to place them side-by-side, one layer deep, in a plastic freezer bag. Lay the bag flat in the freezer. When you wish to retrieve one or more sausages from the bag, strike the bag gently on the edge of the freezer or counter. Take what is wanted from the bag and return the rest to the freezer.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
It's a tried method:Take a paper and apply oil to both the sides of the paperTo one corner tie a thread, now tie paper near a tube light or any bulb. Flies are attracted to bright light. Switch off all the lights except one. You will notice the flies stuck to the paper. 
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
We used to get tons of flies while in Iraq. If you wait for one to land and a vertical surface, then take a lighter which is turned up on high. Then light the lighter and it will fry the fly instantly. I'm thinking of patenting the idea, a small lighter with a big flame, and call it Fly Fry, just need a few investors.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
My weapon of choice is a dish towel. Simple, always available (you can use any sufficiently light towel).Grab one corner with your right hand, don't twist it but let it hang. Pass it above and behind your right shoulder and grab the other end with your left hand. When you want to strike, pull firmly on both ends and release your left hand, releasing a fast whipping motion. Whack !Stronger flies won't die from the hit alone, but you have a few seconds to step on them while they're dazed.

How can I boost my wifi range?
wi-fi is just like a 2-way radio, so you need to think in the same way A. if this is your wi-fiwhy do you have your wi-fi in the garage , why not extend the cable and move it to the 3rd floor or somewhere in between ? turn off, remove some plastic from the top of the antenna, and either elongate it ( the antenna) with a thicker copper wire about 1 meter, or with a thinner wire up to your roomB. not your wi-fi, maybe you are rentinguse a thin copper wire, like from a transformer, wrap it around the antenna, all the way up to your room, and then wrap it around the end of a piece of a thicker copper wire even if its a stranger's wi-fi you can do this  and they cant see it , assuming you have access to the wi-fi locationget yourself a thick copper wire, longer this time  ( like 2 millimeters in diameter ) fix it on the desk with the length to be the same as the width of you laptop then stick it out the window about 2 meters in the wi-fi's direction , this will carry your signal thru the walls ( put your laptop on the desk over the wire )ps: of course a more direct , hard linked route carries more signal

How to protect computer from accidentally pressing the power button?
Buy some sugru (either online, Michaels, and now supposedly Lowes) and mold a ridge around the power button so that you have to use a pen or other small instrument to poke down inside the ridge to depress the power button. I did the same thing for my Toyota key remote, because the 'honk the horn' button kept being pressed in my pocket by coins, other keys, etc. It adheres to plastic and metal quite well. Use the rest of the pack for a dozen other purposes.

How should I store super glue to prevent it from drying out?
The component "super glue" is made of is cyanoacrylate which polymerizes in the presence of water. This actually is the opposite of drying out. The humidity of air already brings a sufficient amount of water for cyanoacrylate to polymerize.Therefore the best place to store it is a dry to very dry place:This could be a refrigerator or even a freezer. To avoid condensation on taking it out of the fridge or freezer (freezing will delay or even stop polymerization) we need to pack it in an air-tight container, envelope or bag and let it reach room temperature before we open the package.To further make the stroage environment dry we can add a silicate bag or salt to the storage container (e.g. from the manufacturer's package of an electronic device).Another possibility to prevent humidity to enter the opened package is storing in a vacuum sealed bag (as it may be used for food packaging).When using and before closing we may also take care to not let humidity or air come into the tube to prevent polymerization at the outlet (commented by user 2619).Safety noteCyanoacrylate is very harmful when ingested. When storing in a fridge or a freezer keep it away from food, use an extra box, and most importantly make sure your children keep away from the fridge.
How can I boost my wifi range?
Few tips about improving WiFi reception of your WiFi router:it may sounds obvious, but moving your router is one of the most effective ways of improving the signal you can get around the home,if you live in an apartment or townhouse complex where other wireless routers can be competing in the same airspace, try to find an optimal wireless channel for your router and as far as possible from your neighbour's WiFi router as it is just as important as the proper placement of your router (every base station within range will show its broadcast channel when you scan WiFi network),invest in WiFi booster/repeater and place it halfway (extenders that simply repeat the original signal over a further distance),Put large furniture along the exterior walls of your home. Signals that don't have to travel through large, cumbersome furniture will make reception better.Minimize mirrors. All metallic surfaces reflect WiFi signals, including the thin metal layer found in most mirrors.As electromagnetic waves, and in this case, wireless signals travel, they  interact with objects and the media in which they travel. As they do  this the radio signals can be reflected, refracted or diffracted.  These interactions cause the radio signals to change direction, and to  reach areas which would not be possible if the radio signals travelled  in a direct line.Place your router to maximize effectiveness. Where you place it has a lot to do with how it performs. When placing a router, consider putting it:Near the center of the house, on a top floor. Radio waves best travel down and laterally.Off the floor, ideally on a wall mount or high shelf.Select a channel that nobody else (or the least number) is using.Away from cordless phones and microwaves, which operate on the same 2.4Ghz frequency.

How to shoot a video underwater using your smart phone?
You could use see-through plastic, perhaps bags. Seal with multiple folds. You can test your solution with something similarly shaped but less vulnerable to water. Test in similar conditions, including depth. Once it is working, if you are still concerned, you could make another one, and seal the first one in it.
How to shoot a video underwater using your smart phone?
I've done this before simply by taking two ziplock/sandwich bags, one inside the other. I take both bags, inflate them slightly by blowing into them, seal them tightly, then gently push on them to make sure they seal correctly. I put my phone (in my case my tablet, yes I know) in the first one, suck out as much air as I can get, seal it (very well!), then take the second one, put the first bag inside the second bag, suck all the air out, and seal it tightly. Sucking the air out, in my experience, helps with the seal between the lens and the bag - if there are bubbles, your video will be absolute rubbish and hard to watch. In my experience, a tight seal between the bags and the camera lets me get clear shots.Note that if you drop your phone, it will sink - your phone is heavier than water, and there isn't any air in the bags to provide flotation. 
How to fix a keyboard with a missing leg?
Replace it with a bulldog clip.it is really easy to remove the handles from a blulldog clip, and they come in parts.Take off both legs (if only one was broken before), and replace them with the metal clip handles.Unlike many solutions, you preserve the ability to adjust it.The clips are normally only a few dollars are are available from most news agents and large supermarkets. They come in a large variety of sizes, so you can set the incline you want.See this instructable (Images are sourced from there as well).I've done this to many keyboards, at home and in our hacker-space.It's great, particularly if you are saving a $150 mechanical keyboard.
How to shoot a video underwater using your smart phone?
You can try to put the phone inside a non-lubricated condom. You should search for one which is made of more transparent material. Put the condom over the phone and tie the end, put some glue on the tie and tie it again. You can add another condom for reliability, but it will blur the images more.
How can I make squirrels leave my roof without poisoning them?
We had the same problem some years ago, except it were fat dormice instead of squirrels. Cute tots. And annoying tots.At first, we tried to find the place where they came into the house, and after some time we found that they used to climb a telephone pole across the street, clamber across the telephone cable and enter through a small gap right under the roof.The gap was wide and hard to block completely, so we built a special blockade out of steel sheet and put it directly onto the cable - and it worked great!The last step was to catch the dormice left inside the house, what we did by using a big live trap (constructed for rats) in the attic and apples as bait. This worked so well that we sometimes even caught two fat dormice at the same time.We kept them in a big cage and fed them with apples and vegetables until the last was caught, and then drove them far into the wild where we released them all together. Hopefully, they were able to start a new life far away from human buildings.Poison: Apart from animal welfare, I think poison is still a bad idea, because what if a squirrel dies from it somewhere under your roof? It would start to rot and stink terribly, and likely you won't be able to get it out.
How can I make squirrels leave my roof without poisoning them?
I have a similar problem.  Squirrels scamper across my roof.  I don't mind the noise, but I don't want them to put holes in my roof with their antics.  So let's run through our options together:Plug any holes in your eaves or roof!  Squirrels probably love the warmth coming from your house, it's cold out there in the winter for us & them!  If you eliminate areas where they can get in or get warm, you'll de-incentivize them.Cut back branches that lead to your roof.  Generally, this is how squirrels like to get on your home.  It won't prevent them 100%, but they're also probably using your roof as a nice, flat (for them) roadway, so if there isn't something to get to at each end of the road, they're going to be less likely to use it.Trap them (have-a-heart or otherwise).  The squirrels are probably especially hungry in the winter, so put out some standard squirrel fare squirrel caviar, like peanut butter.Shoot those squirrels: Squirrel sandwich  Apparently they have a little meat on them, how exotic!  Personally, I am leery of eating small rodents, though.
How to get rid of smell from kitchen trash?
I purchase activated carbon (sometimes called activated charcoal) from the chemical wholesaler Sigma Aldritch. In order to place orders from chem/lab suppliers you typically have to register an account with them as a researcher but once you get in it's just like any other storefront.Sprinkle some granules of carbon into each bin in your house and the only trash smell will be today's. The stuff lasts months for those purposes, and works better than most of the other natural solutions I've tried.
Is there an easy way to remove animal feces from the soles of my boots?
Power-wash the solesThe advantage would be that you avoid the manual removal and need for decontamination of the cleaning tools.  Power-washing allows use of detergent, which would help get rid of the funk.You would want a high angle (less powerful) setting so they don't get damaged.  The key is positioning them on a stand that will not get knocked over.  Wood clamps could be used to hold them down.
How can I repair an axe head that has been separated from the Handle?
Wood shrinks when dried. Attach the head loosely and soak the head and handle in water a day or two (if completely immersed, the head should not rust noticeably).  Unless the hatchet was hot enough to burn the handle, the blade should be OK.If there is no wedge, you'll need to add one for safety, see here.
How can I maximize my refrigerator space when storing so many foods?
Firstly for new foods that you've not yet opened - open them. Take them out of their packaging which can be somewhat bulky and unnecessary and put them in something smaller such as a sandwich / freezer bag which you can then fit the foods into smaller gaps in the fridge. This is especially useful with chicken and other meats, you can split them up too so that each 'package' has enough for one meal / snack portion and then you have smaller things which can fit in even smaller places. With left over foods, avoid leaving the meal on a plate or bowl and again, try transferring to a smaller container, maybe a small Tupperware pot or even another sandwich bag - but make sure you tie the top off otherwise you might find yourself having dinner juices in your fridge the next morning.Also a slightly less 'hacky' option for left overs, cook the right amount to avoid having them in the first place. As mentioned previously, if you store your foods in small portions rather than a whole pack you won't need to cook the entire packet and be left with mountains of food afterwards.You say you want your food to last for a month... Most fresh foods do not last for this length of time unless you are storing them in a freezer so I would check to make sure your food isn't going out of date in this month long food storing period.If you do have a freezer available, do the same as above with your meats and leftovers, if you freeze them in small packages they'll last much longer and you won't have to defrost a whole load of the stuff just to use half of it.Recap:Remove bulky packagingStore in smaller portionsAvoid leftovers in the first placeFreeze where possibleI hope this helps!
How to make sure cabin luggage will be within the size restrictions?
The method I went for in the end was to use some old cardboard and make a box of the maximum allowed dimensions for the airline (56cm x 45cm x 25cm) and try and fit my bag in this makeshift baggage checker.All it required was:A few large pieces of cardboard (wood would be better but would be longer and more expensive)A taper measureA sharp knife / scissorsPackaging / sticky tapeFast drying super glue (optional)I measured out  a couple of panels for the front and back of my measurement box so two pieces 56cm x 45cm and also a top panel with the dimensions of 25cm x 45cm. When I cut these pieces out I left a little bit extra on either side to act as a flap that I could stick to the other panels to make it easier to hold together.I only used these three panels as the width of the bag was never really in question as this couldn't bulge and I could confidently measure it to check the size. Also I ran out of cardboard boxes...Once I had these panels I folder the flaps I had made and aligned one of the front panels with the top and applied some glue to the flaps and then taped them too each other and left a short while for them to dry and become strong enough., I repeated this for the other side.After it had dried I got my bag and stood it up and placed the box over it and to my delight it fit fine. having the box also made it really easy to measure the width of the bag as some points would push against the box so it gave easy measurability (100% a real word).At the end of the day there wouldn't have been anything I could have done so I should have just left it til I got to the airport but it was fun and killed some time at work!Picture below of the finished masterpiece:
Is there an easy way to remove animal feces from the soles of my boots?
I would soak the soles of your boot in a highly-concentrated solution of biological washing powder and warm water. You would only need enough water to cover the soles of your boot, nothing deeper. You would probably need two or three scoops of powder.The biological washing powder should literally eat away at the feces and hopefully remove it entirely. I would imagine you would need to soak the boots overnight at the least.I've not tried this myself, but using biological washing powder to unblock toilets is a well known life-hack. I see  no reason you can't apply the same theory to a boot. 
Is there an easy way to remove animal feces from the soles of my boots?
Use a nozzle shower (in a shower stall or in a bathtub) or a bidet shower (if you don't at home, find the toilet in the nearest hotel where they could have it), set it to cold with high pressure and redirect a water stream at a safe angle inside a shower cabin or keep low over the toilet seat. Apply soap when required. In this process you don't need to use any tools to be cleaned and sanitised, only the area which you eventually left dirty, so use the toilet paper to clean as well as to wipe your shoe.
How can I maximize my refrigerator space when storing so many foods?
Few tips of maximising space in your refrigerator:always use its tall door shelf for tall items and drinks only,squash plastic bottles if possible, so more bottles can fit next to it,use smaller plates and bottles when possible (e.g. pour milk into a glass),use plastic containers/boxes (which are stackable) for separate items or instead of plates,use whole vertical spacekeep your plastic containers on top of each other,adjust fridge shelves when possible (e.g. you can move one shelf one step above for more vertical space),these are 5 food you shouldn't keep in your fridge: tomatoes, basil, potatoes, onions, avocados,in general don't keep fresh veggies in the fridge, it's only make them worse,don't keep items in the fridge which weren't in the fridge when bought it (only when opened if package says so),if you have two half filled bottles of some drinks, consider mixing them together into one,use freezer space for items which you can freeze,use fridge egg tray for eggs and use space between eggs for small items (e.g. ginger, garlik, spices),and finally
How to keep track of which earphone is left or right?
Most earphones have a long and short cable. You could remember which way you wear them.I know that my Sennheiser earphones are short on the left side and long on the right side. I always put them on in the same way, the long wire goes behind my neck towards my right ear, whilst the left side can easily be inserted.

How to get rid of smell from kitchen trash?
The smell is mainly caused by bacteria, and they need moisture to live. So;Drain before binning the trash (in a sieve, or drill holes in a plastic box). Just till no more water drips out.Wrap wet stuff in a newspaper.Put newspaper or old egg cartons in the bottom of the bin. This also stops it freezing onto the bottom in winter, if your bin is outside.In summer put your wrapped rubbish in a plastic sack in the freezer, just put it in the bin on collection day.
How to kill the stink in an unplugged refrigerator?
If your refrigerator is going to be unplugged, then leave the door open! It doesn't have to be open all the way. Wedge it open with something (hang the power cable over the front). Put a notice on it if other people are likely to close it.

How to boil milk without a pot?
Microwave is your best bet. If it exploded last time, it might have been the container. First, get a new container and test that it's microwave safe. Add your milk and a few coffee grounds to create a non-uniform volume so it won't get superheated. Nuke until boiling.If you don't want to go the microwave route, I can think of an alternative but it takes a while and won't technically boil the milk but it will get it pretty close. Put your milk in a container and place that inside a larger container (like a cup inside a big measuring bowl). Boil water through your favorite means and pour it into the large container. Stir a bit and wait for the heat transfer. Repeat with fresh boiling water until the milk is hot enough. I use this to heat frozen breast milk - not to boiling, of course - and it works but it's tedious. Microwave is still the way to go for a daily routine.
What is the best winter clothing strategy for keeping warm?
Rule #1) Stay dry. Your outermost layer should block water but also be breathable so your sweat can escape. Your innermost layer should wick away water. Wool or polyester work well for that.Rule #2) Keep out the wind. Your outermost layer should also block wind. Try to keep it tight where different layers meet. For instance, an elastic waist in a jacket helps keep the wind from billowing up underneath and circumventing the outer layer. Before you go out, stretch your arms around to make sure your wrists are waist aren't exposed.Rule #3) Keep in the heat. Have a collar that blocks heat escape like an elastic band or scarf. Your middle layer should be insulating like wool, fleece, or even down.Rule #4) Be mindful of changing conditions. If you're building up sweat, take off a layer or loosen it so you get better ventilation. If you start to feel cold somewhere, change something. Stand up if your butt gets cold. Pull your hands inside your sleeves or even all the way to your torso if you're losing feeling in your fingers. Go change your socks if your toes get cold.

Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
Yet another method; for completeness since I didn't see it in the other answers. Blow air gently on the fly. Then it's easier to swat it by hand.Just use your lungs and mouth to make a gentle wind strong enough to make the fly grab hard to the surface to avoid getting swept away by the wind. The same gripping mechansim they use to sit upside down works for holding tight to a surface in a windy day. But the back side (for the fly) is a delayed take-off since it has to loose the grip to get away.
How should I store super glue to prevent it from drying out?
The simplest way to store it is using a screw top jar (like a jam or jelly jar) and some silica Gel. That's the bagged stuff that comes with electronics and so on. Designed to suck all of the moisture out of the air.I keep my super glues for modelling for at least 12 months this way.Hope this helps you out.
How to only make one trip when carrying groceries
Cheap aluminum carabiners are what I use; they're available in different sizes for about $1 or less (you don't need the expensive ones for climbing). Not only can they grab eight or  more plastic bags to carry them, but they keep the bags from spilling their contents in the trunk. For individual items, keep some bags in the car.
How to only make one trip when carrying groceries
I've lived on the third floor of apartment building before with no elevator, so making one trip was a priority because who wants to climb those stairs over again or go outside in the cold/heat again. Some things I would do to hopefully make this happen are :never say paper when they ask paper or plastic ask to double bag them all or double bag them all yourself (avoid potential broken bag causing another trip to retrieve what fell)bag the milk cartons, orange juice cartons, 2 liter sodas, etc (bag everything)don't overbuydon't buy 12 pack/ 24 pack boxes of soda/whatever (if you must have soda, buy a 2 liter, and gallon jug for water)This above procedure has worked really well for me in the past. This procedure's success will be dependent on how may bags you have, how heavy they all are, and your arm length and strength. I've surprised my self a few times in just how many bags I carried up in one trip. There's been times where I could only lift the bags like 2 inches above the ground, or where I've had to let them rest on the ground for a while and then get moving again. But remember, pain is gain. Now lets say you don't take the advice above and buy a couple 24 packs of soda and a couple 24 packs of water bottles. There isn't really much of a lifehack short of building your own conveyor belt system from your car to the kitchen. If you have say, a sloped cement/patio leading into your home where you can enter without any steps, then you could possibly use a wheelbarrow or similar and pile up everything on that and make one trip inside the house. But then you're stuck with the wheelbarrow inside your home and would have to make another trip to bring it back out. So other than that, you could use a big plastic bin, but it'll likely be too heavy for one person, but two people could probably lift it.

How to only make one trip when carrying groceries
I've used a medium-large sized backpack to lug groceries in the absence of available transportation.  A large backpack can easily fit in a weeks worth of groceries safely.A bonus is the environmental friendless of not needing any bags (and cost saving if you live in a place that charges extra for grocery bags).Below is an image of a smallish pack that illustrates the point.backpack http://assets.outdoorgearlab.com/photos/8/46/206162_13595_XL.jpg
What is the best winter clothing strategy for keeping warm?
Keep your head covered, it's where most heat escapes. Also high risk areas like ears, fingers, and toes. I layer moisture wick long underwear, then a thicker liner like fleece or the "old style" long johns. I also think your core is important, so on top I'll wear a vest. From then on, it's all about conditions. Wet or not, but I usually wear tough canvas pants and a fleece, hood, and knit cap over the ears. Add gortex if it's wet, and get good gloves and boots. I use the $1.00 jersey cloth gloves under water resistant mittens and army surplus boots that have always kept,my feet warm.Yes, there are electric socks and gloves you could use. Or the Hot Packs, which sometimes I put behind my head. They even used to make "pocket warmers", but I guess that someone bursting into flames ended That.(Too bad, I'd love a couple) However, when it is really cold, you already are in 10 pounds of bulky clothes, so I don't want batteries or stuff in my pockets.
Is there an easy way to remove animal feces from the soles of my boots?
I can't speak of this as a fact, but someone told me a long time ago that you can use a hair drier to dry the feces, and then use a small stick or a toothpick to remove the feces once they are completely dried out.  I did a quick search in Google, and found this - apparently you can get rid of the feces by putting your shoe in the freezer, and then removing the crap out of it with a pencil (!).  It doesn't say anywhere that you have to discard the pencil, but I would highly recommend that :)
How to shred papers/letters without using a shredder machine
I suggest you try putting your letters in a blender.Sounds ridiculous but it should work.
How to shred papers/letters without using a shredder machine
My first answer here isn't so much a hack as it is using something that is on the market to achieve what you want.Have you ever heard of paper shredding scissors? Basically they are a pair of scissors with multiple (~5) blades and you can use these to quickly shred your paper.This is what I am talking about:These can be found on Amazon here.You could also try burning the documents, just get a metal bucket or something non-flammable to put the bits of paper in and then take it outside and set it on fire - if you smoke it would make a nice outside heater during the winter but could be a bit of a hazard so is something to think about.Another method: Soak them in water. This method may take a while however but you will be able to dispose of large quantities of documents in any one go - adding things like vinegar or salt to the warm water solution would help to speed up the process.There are also independent paper disposal companies that you could look into if you want to pass the job off onto someone else. Your local area or city might do a document destruction day which you can hop along to and destroy all your documents for free but you would have research into this.Recap:Shredding scissorsFireWater or chemical solutionIndependent companies / destruction dayMy personal favourite would be the water one, you could also use bleach which would do more damage and I would personally give it a good mix with a long stick or something to really break up the paper. Even if the paper doesn't tear apart, most of the writing should become illegible so it wouldn't even matter!
How can I prevent spiders coming into my house?
I used to have spiders coming into my home, admittedly they were not poisonous as they were mere house spiders, however I am sure this technique will work for you as it did for me!ConkersIf you happen to have some old conkers lying around or somewhere you can go and pick some up, place a pile of them in front of any cracks or corners that you think spiders might be coming in from and it will deter them from entering.I used to get about 5 a day running across my carpets but since I've placed these small conker piles in corners and other places I haven't seen one since! I was a little skeptical at first as I am sure that you will probably be but it really did work and there is plenty of supporting information around the web that you can go and have a look at!You may need to replace them for fresh conkers occasionally but that shouldn't be too much of a problem.One thing I just read is that apparently spiders do not like the smell of citrus so you can rub / squeeze some lemon around any entry points and this should keep them at bay. 
How to shred papers/letters without using a shredder machine
Soak the papers with ordinary water and immediately crumple and squeeze them to compact lumps. Nobody is ever going to read those again!This method doesn't take a lot of time and does not involve chemicals, in fact you don't even need a bucket. Use warm water for comfort, if available.I call this the "papier maché method", although the glue is left out. Papier maché modelling would be a cute way of hiding your discarded sensitive documents in plain sight.
How to restore a rulers edge?
You can do this by affixing a piece of sandpaper to a flat board. Using the board as a guide, sand it smooth. The board will prevent you from sanding it unevenly which would ruin the ruler. You should start with sandpaper around 200 grit and work your way up to 500 or so for a smooth finish.

Breathe on your finger tips (not blow; breathe. like breathing on a cold window to fog it up.) before using them to pull at the plastic bag.

How to separate plastic grocery bags?
Same answer, different version - stick the tip of your tongue out, touch it between index finger and thumb, then separate the bags. Works every time, so long as you're not too worried about what bacteria or virus particles might be present on your fingers at the time... I don't do this any more, I always re-use the more expensive, bag for life, plastic bags, always got one folded up in a pocket or somewhere, which are bigger and stronger. And never stick together!
How to separate plastic grocery bags?
I actually used to work in a supermarket where I would face this problem almost every single day and there were a few different methods that I and other people used to help separate the darned bags:The old classic - lick the tip of your fingers which gives them more grip on the bag when you swipe you finger across it hoping for purchase on the material, it should easily allow the bag to pull away from itself / other bags without too much of a fussPossible downside - people don't like saliva on their bags but if it is only for yourself then I am sure this won't be much of a problemPull the handles - this method works really well for a large amount of bags at a time but also works for small quantities. If to grab the bag, one handle in each hand, and then just pull apart (adjust strength of pull for strength of the bag to avoid damaging) and this will cause parts of the bag (usually at the bottom of the handles) to rise up giving you something to actually pull on and making it easier to separate. Chain reaction - Although this won't solve the problem of opening a single bag, if you have many bags stuck together, once you get the first one to pull away it should also cause the next bag to open and then you can just keep pulling and separating to your hearts content and is strangely satisfying getting a huge bag combo!Although you have said it doesn't work, the rubbing method has always been a favourite with most people and works depending on how you do it, there are two methods:With both handsIf you hold a single bag between both hands and rub together vigorously it usually causes enough friction to pull them apart. Thumb and FingerUsually works best at the bottom of the handles, but I have always had poor success with this method so I guess it might be all down to practice and technique!
How to boil milk without a pot?
My favourite method, in absence of microwave, is to place your mug directly onto electric oven stove.For example to make a coffee, add instant coffee and pour into your mug boiled water (e.g. kettle) to warm your mug (1/3, 2/3 or optional), pour the milk (other rest), place the mug on the stove and set the heat to minimum power (otherwise your mug could break of heat) and relax. It's a bit slower method, but having your whole mug hot, your coffee stay warm for longer.See example:Or if you don't have electric oven, buy a alcohol stove (such as Zelph Starlyte Stove).Or create your own. Here are the instructions:Super Cat Alcohol StoveFind or buy some small cheap food in aluminium can, e.g. cat food.Empty the container (by giving to your neighbour's cat if you don't have) and make some small holes as below.Add some fuel or alcohol (e.g. spiritus) and set on fire (on some safe ground).Source: Super Cat Alcohol Stove at Frontage RoadsSee also:Zelph Starlyte alcohol stove at backpackinglight forum
How to make shoes shine?
In my experience, brushes are better for "maintenance shining", where you just want a quick touch-up. For a high shine, I've always found a rag to be more effective.You can use just about any soft, lint-free cloth, but my favorite was old t-shirts. Polish with a back-and-forth motion of the cloth at high speed.In addition, once you have it mostly done, using a bit of water helps give it a nice glossy coat. Normally I'd just dampen the cloth/rag a bit and keep the same polishing motion as before.This is how I was taught to do it upon joining the military, and I haven't found a more reliable way since.Of course, if you just want a "cheater" shine, use a bit of oil (cooking oil is fine) instead of water. Just a touch, though. This will add an impressive shine, but it won't last long. After a few hours, it will start collecting dust and look terrible until reshined. It's useful if you only wear these shoes once in a great while, for short periods.
How can I prevent spiders coming into my house?
To discourage or kill anything with an exoskeleton that would predictably walk across a horizontal surface, I would recommend trying Diatomaceous Earth. I've never used it on spiders, but it appears that others have and may have solutions for permanently affixing it on horizontal surfaces, etc.
How to make shoes shine?
Weirdly enough, I was given this advice a week or so ago at the grocery store. The old man ringing me up told me that shining your shoes with bananas was the best way to do it. I believe it was using the peel to shine the shoe, then wipe off the residue. Haven't tried it but he swore by the method. If you give it a try, leave a comment with the results. 
How to get rid of bandicoot around house
I had to see what a bandicoot is. Thinking about it, what I would try is an electric fence/wire set low to the ground. You would need to clear an area around the wire so grass and weeds don't touch it. The wire would only have to be present a few days, then removed, allowing stakes holding the wire to be temporary rather than permanent. These are small animals, so be humane and use low voltage, but if it does not work, try a little more voltage.
How to separate plastic grocery bags?
Take the bag with your both hands and blow at the place where you want to open it. The air will penetrate inside the bag and will open it. Downside of this method is that you need to catch the bag with two hands, and sometimes when blowing you may produce strange squeaking  sound.
How can I prevent spiders coming into my house?
Placing lavender in a small cups or bowls near doors, windows etc. should solve your problem. I am not sure about spiders, but lavender is known to repel all kinds of insects, plus it is natural, and smells really nice.
How to restore a rulers edge?
Since I did a lot drawing by hand on college, I realized one thing regarding plastic rulers: generally speaking they are poor quality ( staedtler is not), and the fact that manufacturer when "carves" numbers indicating length uses heat does not help at all, since this procedure causes even new rulers to be bumpy (especially long ones >80cm).So if you are using rulers for something important like college work etc. I strongly recommend that you buy a new one, because everything you try cannot form edge on the plastic which has no bumps.

How to remove epoxy on clothes
Hardener is water soluble. Soap and water will remove it. Probably scrape it first if there's a lot.
How do I save my lenses of my spectacles from scratches
The best way to keep from scratching is to pay attention how the glasses are laid down. They should not be laid on the lenses of course, but they should also not be laid so they flip over onto the lenses. They should not be laid so they fall on the floor. Paying attention is not as easy as it sounds and can be learned. When cleaning use only soap, warm water, and fingers. Blot with a soft cloth and do not wipe. If glasses become smudged, try and leave the smudge if not too bad until soap and water are available. Glass lenses are easier to care for, but plastic lenses require the care described, especially.
How to clean Blu Tack?
It isn't reasonably possible.It may be possible to melt it down, burn the impurities, and remold the glue. But here's what you need to consider:Would it work? Maybe, maybe not.Is it safe? Again, maybe, maybe not. Assuming you don't burn yourself, the chemicals may be toxic once melted. (Edit: It omits CO when exposed to high temperatures)Even if it works and is safe, is it worth my time? Probably not.
Easy way to remove brand stickers in recyclable materials?
Method 1: BoilI've soaked some wine bottles in boiling water for 30 minutes and the labels just fell off.  Some I had to scrub off the residual glue with a scouring sponge, or scrape with a plastic putty knife.  Edit: Some plastics warp when boiled.Method 2: Citrus OilI don't remember where I bought this, and the company details are sketchy* but here's what I was able to google:PB Blaster from The Blaster Group in Australia.* I say sketchy because my bottle looks almost identical to the picture above except it's called "DSR" instead of PB and it says it's made by B'LASTER/B.C.C.I. in Cleveland Ohio, US.  I'm unsure if one copied the other or someone moved.Anyway, there seems to be a citrus-oil component which really loosens some tough labels well.  And the smell is agreeable.  Edit: if the above brand is hard to find, google citrus adhesive remover
Boiled water to clean leather
If you live in a hard water area, there is some merit to boiling the water first. Boiling removes lime, which deposits inside the kettle as limescale; presumably water straight from the tap, still full of lime, may cause 'salt' marks to appear on the leather.
How to fix a dented ping pong ball?
If you can reduce the pressure outside the ball without heating the ball, the ball may suffer less damage. You could put the ball in a container and suck. This will be more effective with a small container. You could also try using the suck end of a vacuum cleaner (if suck ends still exist - haven't seen one for a while), or take the ball to high altitude, or use a plunger, or make (or redeploy) some kind of piston. A vacuum chamber might do the trick. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_chamber
How to stop lizards entering through windows
The easiest way would be to make a lizard door. Failing that, you could could seal all gaps. In my opinion though the best way to deal with the problem would be to work on your tolerance of lizards. I did this (spiders, snakes and lizards) through spending time in lizard country. Once I got over their presence I then had to deal with lizard excrement raining from the ceiling onto my bed and everything else.
How to remove screws with stripped heads?
How about trying to epoxy or super glue a tool to the screw? Or glue something to what's left of the screw so that you can grip it with pliers or a wrench?This can be precise work, so you might want to mask off areas you don't want to get adhesive on. You could use what ever you are going to glue to the screw as a punch through the masking tape to create the mask.
How to remove screws with stripped heads?
The correct screwdriver should be used, first of all. Often times the correct screwdriver will grab the screw when it appears stripped. A sharp screwdriver should also be used, not having rounded edges. A correct screwdriver generally involves using a phillips instead of a reed-and-prince which has a sharper point, and a #2 screwdriver instead of a #1. Very seldom is a #1 screw found on a computer. Screws may be small, but are still #2. If a #2 even begins to fit the screw head, it is a #2 screw. The same cannot be said for #1.In the Air Force I learned the correct way to remove a screw. Many seemingly stripped screws can be removed this way. As mentioned, use the correct screwdriver. Second, apply downward force. Third, bump the screwdriver and do not twist. Usually a slight grab can be felt, but the screwdriver rotates off of it. That slight grab can be exploited. By using a sharp screwdriver and bumping it, going back and fourth, that slight grab will wear into a shoulder large enough to wind the screw with. It takes a certain feel to do this which is not hard to acquire.I want to follow up by saying how to prevent stripping a screw. Go ahead and twist most of the way in. When it gets to the last and starts becoming tight, stop twisting and start bumping. Use small bumps and never large moves.
How to boil milk without a pot?
Try powdered milk. Boil the water in the microwave in a cup, then add the powdered milk afterward. Usually, powdered milk has a poor taste only when drinking it straight. When used as an ingredient or mixing there is usually no poor taste.

How to avoid shortage of toilet paper?
Most people put a spare roll or two in an easily accessible place. What you might do is, always take a roll from that place when needed, and replace the roll there. You should always have paper available that way. This satisfies your question "how to avoid shortage ....".
How to only make one trip when carrying groceries
You could use luggage, e.g. a large suitcase or trunk that has wheels, and load the groceries into the luggage while in the boot of the car.
How to prevent soda from fizzing upon opening
The best way to go is always wait a few minutes before opening the can.  But if you can't wait because you are in a desert about to die from dehydration, then what always had worked for me is to gently hit the bottom of the can against a table, or even with the palm of your hand.  For this to work, the can should always be pointing up, and the hit must come straight upwards. I have used this technique with soda cans and champagne bottles - it works really great with champagne bottles, actually.  You can open the bottle without spilling a single drop out of it, really useful when you are indoors and afraid to ruin the carpet  =)
How to remove a urine smell from a bathroom?
Go to your local animal care facility and purchase any enzymatic based urine cleaner for dogs or cats. This works well on human urine stains too.
How to separate plastic grocery bags?
One Method I saw recently was to have a small try (could be a jar lid or a gum tin) with a wet paper towel inside. You merely have to dab at it with you finger tips and you are good to open the bags. In a super market this would be a much better option then licking you dirty fingers.
How to prevent outline marks on trousers?
I no longer carry anything in any my pockets except one credit card, a driver license, and keys on a small ring if absolutely necessary. I made this change some time ago due to reasons expressed in the OP. I had a pocket knife, change, many keys, and a fat wallet. It's just what a person is accustomed to and these things are not missed. Also it saves pockets from coming apart inside. When I carry a phone I use a clip put on the front of my pants rather than the side.
How to only make one trip when carrying groceries
Get some reusable bags. I have the ones below and they are fantastic. They have nice big handles. I do not have to worry about them ripping. Plus they are better for the environment! Two ore three of these can fit a weeks+ worth of grocery's. 
How to prevent outline marks on trousers?
You can carry your objects in a bag: your cellphone, wallet, keys and other things you used to carry in your pocket. There are many bags for woman or for man, you can look very modern carring such a bag or backpack. There are different sizes and you can choose if you want to carry many things or just keys, a cellphone and some money. There are bags for important documents which you can hide under your shirt. And I have seen a belt with zippers on the inner side for hiding small objects.Otherwise you can put these objects in your jacket not in your trousers.You can hang a key on your neck tied with a textile band like a necklace.Put some money in your bra. Some girls keep there a mp3 player while walking.
How to remove a urine smell from a bathroom?
First, if it's urine that is causing the stench, the urine smell may be neutralized by using a product called 20 Mule Team Borax. It can remove stains and fight the enzymes that cause that unpleasant smell. It won't be a waste of money because Borax has tons of other household uses too! I use Borax for issues similiar to the one you're having now, plus it works great as a laundry booster too! Check it out. Good Luck!!
How to improvise snowshoes?
If you tie pine branches (like from a Christmas tree) to the front of your boots with string through your boot eyelets, you don't have to worry about the twisting to the side if you are walking forwards and you get a nice large surface area to tread with.http://www.outdoorlife.com/blogs/survivalist/2014/01/step-step-make-emergency-snowshoesEdit for detail:Step OneStart by cutting two pine boughs with ample foliage to about 3 feet (1 m) long.Step TwoTie a string near the base of the branch, where you cut it. Then flip the branch over and tie an overhand knot on the opposite side.Step ThreePlace the branch so that its top (the side that faces upward when the branch is on the tree) is face down in the snow, with the foliage bending upward. Step on it, tie the string to your shoe, and thread the line through the shoelace eyelets.Step FourOnce you're strapped in, walk normally across the snow. Your boot will naturally come up from the branch about 30 degrees when you walk, which will keep you from sinking into the snow.
How to remove lice
Over the counter treatments are the only way to go here. Go to your local drug store and get them. Before over the counter things were available the most common treatment was to shave the affected area.Also you need to do some heavy duty spring cleaning or you risk the lice easily coming back. You need to wash all your clothes, and all your bedding, preferable in hot water. Lice can live in your clothes and in your bedding for awhile and if not removed will migrate back to your head. This is true for all types of lice on all parts of your body.
How to remove lice
Ah yes. My family has had to deal with this quite a few times over the last few years.The first step is to thoroughly soak your head in rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol). Now, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap - you may need someone to help you. Keep your head wrapped for about an hour. Rinse your hair thoroughly and then comb - to the scalp - with a nit comb or any other extremely fine-toothed comb.You may want to treat again once or twice a week for two weeks just to be sure that you have them out (see Life Cycle of a Louse). Also, wash your hair frequently and use slippery/greasy conditioner to help the nits, eggs and adult lice to slide off of your hair.Here is a link to several other natural remedies (some of which you mentioned you've already tried) as well as how to get the bugs out of furniture. 
How to remove lice
My daughter got lice several times in elementary school. After a ton of research we settled on this clinically proven, nontoxic (though labor-intensive) treatment involving only Cetaphil cleanser, a comb and a hair dryer:http://nuvoforheadlice.com/test/There is a lot of misinformation out there on the 'net (such as in some of the other answers here!) and even in the information packets handed out by schools and doctors. Here's a small list of the most critical pieces of information we learned: No matter what treatment you used, you must perform it twice: Once to kill the existing adult lice, and again exactly 7 days later to kill the newly hatched juvenile lice. It takes a louse 10 days to become sexually mature, so no new nits will have been laid after the first treatment. Nuvo treatment recommends a third time to kill any lice that may have hatched after the second treatment.You do not need to "treat the home!" This is the most stress-inducing inaccuracy out there. Lice can't survive off of the human head, so they choose to stay on the head, and they're quite good at it! So you will not get lice from a carpet, a stuffed animal, a blanket etc. Don't bag up all your stuff or wash it at high heat. Complete waste of time and worry. Caveat: Sometimes juvenile lice ("instars") will attach to combs/brushes, or fall onto a pillowcase. So wash these items after each treatment (before going to bed or using them). You don't need to "kill the eggs" or remove all the nits. No treatment out there successfully kills all the nits. They all work by disrupting the life cycle. So attempting to remove the nits is a huge waste of time, and is stressful and unlikely to be successful.
What kind of stone may be used for whiskey rocks?
Searching a bit resulted in the following answer:Whiskey rocks are made of solid (or milled) soapstone (source).Though, there seem to be more kinds of whiskey rocks. This site shows different ways to cool your whiskey with a chart, which shows which way cools for the longest time. Cubes, rings or balls of steel seem to work the best. Cleaned properly, I don't think they will affect the flavor of your beverage.If you have the tools to work on steel I would recommend this rather than making your own whiskey rock.
How to avoid shortage of toilet paper?
Simple, but less hacky: use less toilet paper.The following video is more a joke than an actual answer, but it shows, that there are people who use only one piece of toilet paper - even after big business.It's German, but I guess you will understand him based on his gestures. :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BP-QKqgFSg
How to remove lice
The issue we had with effective anti-lice treatments of our kid's heads was that their contents are either highly toxic (Lindane) or highly allergenic (Pyrethroid) if tested and approved as a medical product. In addition more and more lice are becoming resistant to these drugs.Other non-pharmaceutical remedies were not proven to be efficient, at least they were not tested in large studies as needed for official approvements as a drug.Nevertheless we succeeded to entirely get rid of lice several times by using a shampoo preparation available from our local drug store containing a mix of coconut oil and the silicone oil dimeticone. We had to follow the instructions closely, i.e. two applications of the shampoo each followed by 30 minutes tight enclosure of the shampooed hair in a plastic shower cap before rinsing. This had to be repeated after a week to also get rid of new lice that may have hatched from remnant vital nits.We used a similar preparation for washing the bed linens and clothes too in order to also get rid of lice or nits there (but this was only for us to feel comfortable, we did not see any nits or lice outside the heads of our kids).The containing oils are supposed to suffocate both, the insects, and their nits.The shampoo will not remove the dead nits still tightly attached to the hair. We could impossibly comb the long curly hair of our girl using a nit-comb, it hurt too much. In addition how long we tried to remove nits with the comb they would still remain attached to the hair in large numbers. But still, after the shampoo treatments had been repeated after a week the remaining nits obviously were dead as we did not observe any further vital lice and the dead nits disappeared gradually over some weeks.

I have tried everything as well, and these lice are difficult to remove.My friend suggested me to use nitty gritty comb. Google it, and you wouldn't regret it.
How can I make my shoes less slippery?
Depending on your shoes, they can often be transformed with leather patches, or entirely new super grip soles that are designed specifically for the application you have in mind. Your local, family-run, cleaning, key-cutting, shoe repair shop should be able to recommend something and help you with that.Support local.
How to remove lice
Best thing I found when my daughter was small was an electronic comb. Far more pleasant than putting poison on her head and because it is used with dry hair it works with kids who hate having their hair washed. I read that experts say these are no more effective than a plain nit comb but that wasn't our experience. It may be just the fact it makes a noise when zapping a louse but in this situation every little helps.
How to hard-boil an egg in the microwave safely?
Here are few ideas:use a microwave safe bowl or cup with just enough water to cover the eggs and boil the water without eggs, then turn the heat off and put the eggs in for 12-15 minutes (soft or hard) using medium power,Consider adding 1/4 teaspoon of vinegar and salt, and cover the dish.wrap each egg in a piece of aluminium foil (make sure that whole shell is covered) and put it into water - foil prevents the microwaves from penetrating the shell causing exploding eggs and water in the foil should prevent the arcing.Warning: Be careful, as too high temperature for too long can even blow open the door of your microwave, so proceed with caution.Source: Boil an egg in the microwave at Cooking SEFurther read:Microwave ovens should warn of exploding eggs at New ScientistWhat's the right way to hard boil eggs? at Cooking SEMicrowaving scrambled eggs at Cooking SETowards the perfect soft boiled egg by Martin LerschHow to Cook an Egg in the Microwave at Better Homes

How to make non-drinkable seawater drinkable?
Quite a simple method that would get rid of any salt in the water is to simply boil the water and collect the condensed water vapor in a separate cup / container.Things you would need:Saucepan with a lidA clean glass / Pyrex cup or jugSea / salt waterA stove or fireSteps to 'de-saltify' the water:Place the cup in the middle of the saucepan (or wherever the highest point on the lid of the pan is) you will need to have a small enough glass that will fit in the pan with the lid on!Pour in your seawater - try not to go to close to the rim of the pan to avoid spillage, and also avoid making it close to the height of you glass as this might cause sea water to enter which will contaminate the new fresh waterPlace the pan / cup / water combo onto a stove or a sturdy grill above a fire (hot enough to boil water) and apply heatPlace the lid onto the pan and wait!How it works:The heat from the flames will cause the seawater to boil and thus evaporate, salt in the water is too heavy to evaporate with the water so is left behind.The water vapor then rises up in the pan until it reaches the lid where it tries to escape and heads to the highest point of the pan.Here it will be unable to escape and will condense as the lid will be cool enough to bring the vapor below boiling temperature and the condensed water will fall into the glass below leaving you salt-free water!I managed to find a site that explains it in a different way that might be more clear and comes with some fun videos if that gets your blood pumping, here: WikiHowNote: You will have to try and keep the lid down as the pressure might cause it to bounce around and allow some of the steam to escape!!!  Note 2: This will not disinfect the water if you are actually getting it straight from the sea there will be lots of bacteria in the water which won't be eradicated by this simple process - hence the super expensive purification process in your examples!!!
How to make non-drinkable seawater drinkable?
One of the simpler systems involves gravity fed filtration, often with sand and/or coal as the filter medium. Using a three container construction, you put salt water in the top container. It drips into the middle container that holds your filtration media (sand, coal, etc.). The last container catches the filtered water. (You can simplify the system to a two container system by including the filtration media at the bottom of the top most container.)Some downsides to this process:It doesn't get everything.It is slow.It requires changing your filtration media frequently.You have to drip the water at a rate fast enough to allow gravity to pull it down, but not so slowly that the water evaporates.
What are more efficient alternatives to walking?
Each day going to work I have a journey that involves a mix of walking and taking trains, and there is one thing that I have noticed that appears to be on the rise in popularity and to me it does seem like a much better alternative to walking or cycling.Scooters for the commuters (made up that name, but it has a nice ring to it).They are neat looking, fold-able push scooters, not like those ones you see now-a-days at skate parks that the kids are riding, but one more suitable for the urban terrain.  They have large robust wheels and will help you get from A to B in no time at all, quicker, easier, and more fun than walking!I haven't yet invested in one because I commute with other people. But these things do look fun and I might look into getting one in the future.Here is a link to where you can buy some: www.amazon.co.uk - some of them look childish, but amazon doesn't have great refining options so look around!

If you already have coffee and a cup, you're done.  Pour coffee into cup, let sit for a while (optional), and drink.Not to need any of that extra fufu (i.e. cream/sugar) in the first place is the ultimate life hack.  Result = drink coffee anywhere regardless of the availability of "condiments".
How to stop headphones bouncing around when walking?
Today was the day that everything changed.I found a solution to this issue and it will never trouble me again.I wear a jacket with a front zip and poppers to cover said zip. If I simply place the headphones along the zip (so long as it is done up) and the cover them with the popper flap, they remain both protected and out of the way with no bouncing around! Pictures to follow:  Step one.Take hold of flailing headphones. Step two.Un-popper jacket and place headphones along zip line. Step three.Do up the popper flap to conceal and constrain the headphones.This method would also work if you were feeding the headphones underneath your clothes as you could just feed it straight up along this zip line and that would work just as well.
How to make non-drinkable seawater drinkable?
This isn't really a hack - but if you really want to do home desalination then there are some practical solutions.Ocean-going boats have desalination pumps for providing their fresh water. They refer to them as a "watermaker". A quick look on ebay yielded one for c.3000USD.There's a hand-operated version that they put in life-raft. Not cheap:http://www.nitro-pak.com/katadyn-survivor-06-desalination-watermaker...but again on ebay for about 100USD.There a thing called a "solar distiller" that I think they also use in liferaft. Can't find a price at the moment but they are very basic so should be dirt-cheap.EDIT: The only way to save on the huge energy requirements of desalination is to use solar power. Aside from the small inflatable solar distillers that I mention above, I also remember seeing a very hacky thing done on TV many years ago. The guy dug a pit in the ground about 20cm deep and lined it with black plastic. He the erected what I can only describe as a "tent" of clear plastic over the pit but in such an arrangement that a plastic gutter ran along the bottom edge of the sloping sides into a collector. The water evaporates due to energy absorbed by the black liner and leaves ALL contaminants in the pit. It condenses on the slopes and runs into the gutters and thence into your collector. Voila - fresh drinking water from any contaminated source you can find - for free.The downside is that you have to regularly flush-out the bottom of the pit. I'm sure a bit of ingenuity could eliminate that step by making it automatically flush itself on a regular basis. For example, I've envisaged a long, shallow sloping bed with a poly-tunnel  roof over. Dirty water continually trickles in at the top and evaporates, the residual water continues down the slope and out to waste.
How to stop headphones bouncing around when walking?
Another solution would be placing the in ear headphones over your ears.Imagine the following picture with the grey clip being your cable joining together under your chin. This way the two headphones also don't get tangled and you already know which is right and left. When you're ready to listen to music again, you just reach up to your ears and plug the headphones back in.
How to cut paper without scissors?
Fold and then run your finger along the edge to totally flatten it out and then use a kitchen knife (ideally), just the same as a letter opener. Keep the paper taught to avoid slipping or ripping. Nice clean cutYou can also use a ruler to do the same thing put the paper on a flat surface, fold it over and then slider the ruler in. Keep it taught as above and there you go!

How to cut paper without scissors?
Disclaimer: Most of the answers/techniques I have seen here so far actually only work on flat surfaces. Except licking the crease method (provided you can perform a straight fold mid-air) works mid-air. I use this almost daily, but forgot to mention it, because it's became a routine to meI can just add some tips to the fold and rip method you already know: Thanks to agweber for pointing out: By fold I always mean to tighten the crease, by running the edge between your pointer finger and thumbnail or (on flat surfaces) running your thumbnail over the crease, after defining the crease.fold the paper at the desired spot multiple times in both directions (at least 3 times each [depending on thickness of paper]; you will get the feel of it)unfold it and start pulling on both sides of the crease(the crease will start to bend up, picture below) in a slightly downways direction (left: SW, right: SE)You still can't rip a whole piece of paper without rearranging your hands when ripping, but I feel like you can separate a bigger section, before it starts to veer.(don't mind the arrows)Try this with an unimportant piece of paper and you will feel when you need to move your hands down to start ripping the next section.Fold, lick and ripAs mentioned above, this is the only method that works mid-air. Downside of this is, that you don't get very smooth edges and you may lose some paper in the crease area.For a related explanation you can search for a video explaining how to roll a cigarette/joint backwards. There the sticking out part is not used and the paper is pretty thin but the tearing is very similar.Fold (at least) once at the desired spot and flatten the crease.lick the crease (or damp with water) slightly. Be careful not to lick to much / press your tongue to hard. Really just the crease should be wet, not the area next to it.Before it dries again, unfold it and gently rip the two parts apart. Hold one side with one hand and with the other hand pull the other side away (I prefer pulling it towards me or away from me, not in the direction the paper is). Section for section. You can try doing it on the whole document but keep in mind that (depending on thickness of the paper) the paper is weak and will start to veer easily.Optional (while edge is still wet): Burn off the grains that stick out of the edge on both parts. Be careful not to burn the paper - you don't have to hold the edge directly into the flame, a distance of 1cm or less is enough. I recommend a lighter on low flame, matchsticks or a candle.
How to cut paper without scissors?
when you do the fold and rip method, just lay something straight and flat along the crease, like a book or a ruler and then push down on the object to keep the paper secured and then rip pulling the paper over the object.  having the object there will keep your tear from veering off track

Mixing coffee without a spoon
When it is clear that it is only me drinking this coffee I use this trick: I take a first sip and, while still having the cup in drinking position, I "blow" the coffee back into the cup so that the created turbulences sirres up the sugar at the bottom. I always wondered if this is considered inhygenious by someone, but it works for me.
Mixing coffee without a spoon
Some coffee shops provide spaghetti pasta for such a use.You can also pour the dry ingredients slowly into the water stream, but you need steady hands and good timing so as not to end up with dry ingredients left once the cup is full of water.
How to cut paper without scissors?
You can use something pointy, like a needle or a thumbtack. Make sure to use at an angle.Otherwise when doing the fold and rip method licking the crease (when folded) helps the rip not to veer off course.
Mixing coffee without a spoon
Maybe this is a variation on other answers, but one option is to make sure the cup is significantly bigger than the amount of coffee you are drinking to allow room to safely 'swirl' the coffee and ingredients together. If there's a lid, you can get away with a little less room. If it's one of the lids that has a closable sippy hole, you may even get away with actual shaking the coffee (though obviously ensure that the lid is held on tightly as you do)
How to cut paper without scissors?
The fold-and-rip method works or doesn't work based on the type of paper you are working with. Paper that is made on rolls (most office paper, newsprint, paper towel, etc) has a 'grain'. The pulp fibers all align in a certain direction (typically with office paper, the long direction). It's quite easy to fold-and-tear this type of paper along this axis. It's rather difficult along the other axis.Some ways to make this easier:Do a double fold (fold one way, then the other, to try and break the fibers along the fold)Once folded, find a solid straight edge to lay on one side of the fold, and then tear the other side in an upward motion along the straight edgePrior to tearing, moisten the fold to help loosen the fibers.At the end of the day, though, you'll still find that you can't do this successfully 100% of the time. The paper's grain just makes that difficult. The other way to make paper is via matts/screens. In this scenario, there is no grain as the pulp fibers align themselves all in random directions. Paper made on matts tends to be artist's papers such as watercolor paper, thick cotton rag, printmaking paper, etc. These papers are actually incredibly easy to tear along a straight line with just a straight edge. No need for fold at all. Other ways to cut paper if you have a good straight edge to use:run a knife along the straight edgerun a 'roller cutter' along the straight edge (typically used to cut fabric)open up your scissors and use one side as a knife blade along the straight edge.
What are more efficient alternatives to walking?
A longboard! It's the perfect mix between portability and speed. It looks like a skateboard, but the main goal is to "cruise" as smooth and fast as possible instead of performing tricks. They come in different size and shapes. In your case, I would suggest one with a low wheel-base for great stability since you aren't planning to do extreme things with it. A longboard seems difficult to ride, but the learning curve is really fast. Once you master the skills of long boarding, your life as a commuter will be more enjoyable!
Mixing coffee without a spoon
This may not strictly answer your question, but two possible suggestions with one main point: Avoid the situation!1) Always carry a stirrer of some sort with you. Try a small measuring spoon -- often the smaller measurements aren't too long and since they're often held on one ring or chain as part of a set, you can use attach it to your key ring (assuming you have a tissue or something to wipe it with)2) Use a self-stirring mug (search google or ebay) rather than the provided Styrofoam ones, though I realize this may not be feasible if you're traveling and can't carry the mug.
Taking out folded paper hand towels from a dispenser using wet hands
Get the paper towel on your way into the washroom and stuff it half way into your pocket. This also gives you a chance to find out early whether there are any paper towels to begin with, so you can go look for toilet paper in a stall.
How to cut paper without scissors?
Wet wool. Honestly. Wet a length of wool or yarn or string, you get the idea; and run your fingers across it to whip away extra moisture: you want it wet but not dripping. Lay it on the paper where you want the cut (the wool is the line you'd cut along with scissors), and put a bit of force on it (pulling down with the loose ends or fold the paper over so the wool is in the crease). The paper will be weakened enough to just (slowly, to be safe) pull the sheet free from the rest of the paper. This works on paper, card (but not cardboard), so it should be good for a huge amount of purposes (including, for what its worth, taking a page neatly out of a notebook or even a book like a novel)
How can I confirm if meat is cooked without a thermometer?
The Finger Test to Check the Doneness of Meat, by Elise on Simply RecipesRaw:Open the palm of your hand. Relax the hand. Take the index finger of  your other hand and push on the fleshy area between the thumb and the  base of the palm. Make sure your hand is relaxed. This is what raw  meat feels like. (Check this out the next time you have a raw steak to  cook.)Welldone: Now gently press the tip of your pinky and your thumb together. Again  feel the fleshy area below the thumb. It should feel quite firm. This  is what well done meat feels like when you press on it. (Check this  out the next time you overcook a piece of meat.)Medium: Press the tip of your ring finger and your thumb together. The flesh  beneath the thumb should give a little more. This is what meat cooked  to a medium doneness feels like.Medium Rare: Gently press the tip of your middle finger to the tip of your thumb.  This is medium rare.RarePress the tip of your index finger to the tip of your thumb. The  fleshy area below the thumb should give quite a bit. This is what meat  cooked to rare feels like. Open up your palm again and compare raw to  rare.Sources: simplyrecipes.comIllustration (unknown origin).Sources: simplyrecipes.com
How can I confirm if meat is cooked without a thermometer?
This depends on the meat you are cooking. Chicken should be completely white, no pink. Beef only needs to cook surfaces exposed to air, so burgers should be cooked through to make sure they are safe, and steaks only need the outsides cooked. Beef turns brown when cooked. Pork should have no pink and should not bleed when cut. Shrimp turns orange when cooked. I think crab does too, but I'm not 100% on that. As for most other seafood, I wouldn't try without a thermometer. Same with turkey. Just not worth taking a risk getting sick because you want to use a "hack" and get by without one. Even the red bump thermometers aren't trustworthy. 
How can I confirm if meat is cooked without a thermometer?
Edit: The question is how to tell if meat is done without a thermometer. A person can look at the meat to tell, by how drawn up it is. Nothing else but eyeballs are required. Without past experience, watch the meat as it cooks. When it ceases drawing up and no red fluid comes out when poked, it is done.I can look at the meat and tell if it's done by how drawn up it is. Very seldom am I wrong. Beyond that, the outside color indicates whether it's going from medium to well.

How can I organize Micro SD Cards?
You could get a piece of cardboard and cut Mirco SD sized holes into it and then write what each one is above or below its respective hole.  You'd need to put a backing on the card so  that the SD cards don't just fall straight through if you try and pick the board up - try something like another sheet of cardboard or even paper, if you're looking for a more protective solution, do the same with Styrofoam or something similar (however Styrofoam is prone to static build up and could lead to the SD Card being damaged or destroyed).You could also put the cut out into a small plastic cover (something like a normal SD card or an old Game Boy game case) which would then keep them all sorted and all in one place!Here's a link to instructables where I was able to find something similar to what I am describing.If that doesn't do it for you then you could invest in something like a small fishing box with lots of small compartments and have one compartment for each SD Card - might be a bit over the top for such small devices but it is up to you! 
How to cut paper without scissors?
The simplest way? Lick the paper.Fold it so that the crease will lie where you want the cut to occur. Then, lick the edge of the crease. Fold it back over on itself, so the crease is on the other side of the paper now, but in the same place. Lick the edge of the crease again. Rip carefully.Don't want to use spit? Run a finger under the tap or something. (Why do so many of the other answers require tools?? If the asker doesn't have scissors, why would they have a ruler or roller cutter?)
How to cut paper without scissors?
The only way to cut paper with clean straight edges is using a cutting ruler and a sharp cutting knife.  This will beat all scissors in precision. All tear and cut solutions will inevitably lead to more or less visible paper fibers at the cutting edge, and in addition the foldings process will make the rims always stand up a bit.But alas, once you don't have a pair of scissors at hand you likely also won't have a cutting ruler or a cutting knife.This is when our imagination will give us all the hacks needed:Make something a cutting rulerAnything with a stiff straight edge may serve as a ruler for this single purpose.Use a board or a latchTake the edge of a plastic box  Use a picture frame  Find a glass pane  Use an old tile  Take a thick cardboard  Look out for a metal pipe with a square profiletake a hardcover bookuse a CD or DVD caseof course there will be many more items you may find when looking aroundMake something your cutting knifeThe most important thing a cutting knife needs to have is a sharp, very sharp blade.Razor blades  Surgeon's skalpels may even beat a cutting knife in sharpness   Steak cutlery when freshly sharpened  Some kitchen knifes when newly sharpened may also cut paper  Swiss army knifes or other pocket knifes come with blades sharp enough  Broken glass may have very sharp ends (but take care to cut the paper, not your fingers!)When in an outdoor survival camp you may even use a sharp-edged rock (flintstones are great) but you may not really need to cut paper there.How to cutWhen cutting the paper it is vital to hold the ruler firm in place. It easily slips especially after we felt we need more pressure from a not too sharp blade. Cut several times the same line with little rather than one time with too much of pressure applied to the blade. Cut on a firm but not hard surface. There are special cutting mats to protect your desk from scratches but you could also use a newspaper or a journal.Safety note: be very careful when using a cutting ruler. Be constantly aware that the cutting knife wants to jump over the guiding edge of the ruler and attack your hand. This becomes more likely as you decrease the angle between the blade edge and the paper surface, that is, when you "drag" the blade along instead of holding it near vertical.

What are more efficient alternatives to walking?
This may sound strange and childish, but I had a 1 mile walk to the subway everyday over bumpy tree root lifted sidewalk filled with other pedestrians, baby strollers etc. The street was busy and the space between parked cars and moving cars was a dedicated bike lane with a large number of bikers who yelled at skateboarders.  I was always frustrated I could not increase the length of time getting to the subway without generating a sweat in my clothes.One day I saw a grown man skipping...like a kid in a playground... simply skipping to the subway. It is less then jogging, so it doesn't generate as much sweat and even with nice shoes you can do it.  Skipping doesn't require smooth sidewalks or a speed that can match or keep up with bikers.  It can also avoid other pedestrians, baby strollers etc.  The only issue is its skipping and not the most manly mode of transportation.I could never bring myself to do it, but its an alternative that's faster and pretty adaptable to environments. 
How to clean dried blood and bone from the car grill
Dried blood can not easily be removed by general purpose soaps as it consists of rather firmly denaturized proteins designed for tightening wounds.Glass cleanerOne known chemical dissolvent also capable of dissolving dried blood is ammonia, which is an ingredient of houshold glass cleaners. This makes it easily and widely available. Glass cleaners do come in a spray bottle to make application on a car grill easier. Nevertheless Ammonia only helps to soften the dried blood when soaked with it. We need some mechanical shrubbing in addition, best with a soft sponge or brush to not damage the chrome and varnish. Depending on the amount of blood it may also be sufficient to just spray water from a hose.After the blood was removed we will likely get a much easier removal of other materials such a bone, hair or other body remnants, as they will be firmly attached by blood clots that act like glue here.Meat tenderizersIn case we do not succeed with glass cleaner we can also add enzymes to ease dissolving the blood proteins. Such enzymes are found in laundry agents but we may get a much higher concentration of enzymes if we applied them directly. Powerful enzymes such as bromelain or papain are used in meat tenderizers. Therefore we can apply meat tenderizing powder on tenacious blood stains after soaking them.
How to steep but separate leaves in a teapot without a mesh strainer?
you can make your own tea bags by using a square of cheese cloth or muslin folded over a few times, place the loose tea in it, use butcher's twine to tie the bag up and there you go! you can even untie the twine and re-use the cloth for other bags.  What's good about this hack is that you can make tea bags of any size depending on how large you cut the cloth. so you can make single serving ones for just a cup or you can make larger ones for when you want an entire pot of tea.If you don't have cheese cloth/muslin I suppose you could use another fabric but you really want something thin so that the water can seep in and mix with the tea and also to let flavor out of the bag and into the tea.

AppleFor this trick, you need an apple!Just kidding, any acid-like vegetable/fruit is fine:)In order for a fruit or vegetable be a battery, it needs to be able to conduct electricity (acids make H+ ions/charged particles, when put in a solution like water). These type of acid particles are the same as in electric current. So in other words, more acidic, then better (or more sour it taste, it more acidic). As you can guess, a lemon would make a better battery than banana, however less power than a potato!To use lemons, for 1.5V you may need around 3-5 lemons connected in series. You can use a copper penny/nail and a galvanized/zinc nail into each side to create +/- terminals).

How to generate electricity for free?
If you're like me, then you probably have at least one or two spare electric motors lying around the house. If not, check again: fans, remote-controlled cars, vacuum cleaners, electric lawnmowers, dishwashers, and even electric shavers are all examples of household devices that contain electric motors. (Basically, if it has moving parts, you're probably good to go!)Why do I bring up the subject of electric motors? Simple!Any electric motor can also be used as an electric generator.DISCLAIMER: high-end "brushless" electric motors require special circuitry for use as generators, as do "A/C" motors. Make sure you know what kind of motor you're dealing with before you start, and ALWAYS do your research! Otherwise, you might end up damaging your electronics (or yourself!) instead of charging them. Also, ALWAYS make sure to test your rig before you connect anything to it--you might find yourself generating 110V A/C when you expected to find 5V D/C, or vice versa!If you have any spare electric motors lying around (or are willing to sacrifice an old appliance to get one), then it's just a matter of finding some way to keep the motor spinning, and voila! Free electricity.Here's few ideas to get you started:Try adding a handle and cranking the motor-generator's shaft manually, or (when you get tired of that) attaching it to a bicycle and pedaling. If you have a decorative windmill in your yard (or can rig one up), that's plenty to turn an appropriately-sized motor-generator. Assuming that you get plenty of wind where you live (this works great in farm country), a setup like this can be scaled all the way from AA-battery charging up to constant 12V power supply.If you live in an apartment and water service is included in your rent, then look up DIY water turbines; it's easier than you'd think (albeit not particularly eco-friendly)!If you have natural flowing water (stream, river) nearby, consider rigging up an old-school water wheel. They can push a lot of torque at a consistent(ly slow) speed, so even some geared motors might be within your reach; appropriately matched to an output, you could potentially get a solid 12-14V D/C out of one of these.If you have one of those novelty hand-crank or shake-to-charge flashlights lying around, they've already done all the work for you; simply tap into the wires that feed its internal battery, and you can extract the power it generates for other purposes.And while I'm at it, here are a few more best practices to help you make the most of your DIY generator:I highly recommend connecting an appropriately-selected rechargeable battery to the output; as long as you put a diode in line with the wires to make sure that the power flows into the battery instead of out of it (once again, do your research), you can store the electricity you generate for later use!Another option is to add a capacitor in line with the output (note: only works with D/C generators); it will help to smooth out the electricity you produce, so it will play nicer with others.If you're willing to sink an upfront investment into this project, then you can never go wrong with a full-on voltage regulator; these circuits can take any given input voltage (within a certain range), and coerce it to a specific output voltage. If you're planning on directly charging/powering any real electronics with this setup, then one of these is a must!Another fun project (which should only be tackled after you've got a powerful generator pumping a regulated voltage into one or more large 12V batteries) is to invert your D/C power supply so that you can drive 120/240V A/C appliances; this add-on requires that everything up to this point is solid and dependable, but you'll definitely be left with something worth bragging about!There's enough information to get you going, but as always, do your research! You might be surprised to find how deep this rabbit hole goes. XD
How to vacuum room with minimal amount of effort?
Don't try to do it too fast. If you swipe too fast it won't pick up all the dust and you have to do that part of the floor again.Also don't let the dustbag get too full or you will lose suction.Clean/replace the filters, to keep suction high.Declare part of your house "no-go", live in the kitchen, less use of an area means less cleaning.
How to make an ice pack that doesn't leak
If you sport a lot you should invest in a gel-pack or two. They're not expensive. The benefit of gel-packs is that they don't freeze. A frozen block of ice only has a small contact area. The gel-pack has gel which isn't frozen so you can get a much larger contact area by wrapping it around.If you want to go cheaper you could look at cooling elements you use for a coolbox. They're very cheap but blocks of ice.And the very very cheap way is using icecube-bags you get in the supermarket.Keep normal precautions though, never let it touch the skin directly, just like with ice.

How should I deal with boxes for appliances?
Arrange them in a large cube and use strips of duct tape or packaging tape to keep them together. Using plastic wrap around the cube is even better, but make sure you have enough!
Eradicate a cockroach infestation
Mix a bag of flower, a box of sugar, and a box of borax together in a large bowl.  Cover the infected area, probably your kitchen, and all nearby flat areas including the floor with the powder and do not touch the powder for at least 10 days. Also set out lots of glue traps against walls and in corners.You will begin to notice that roaches are crawling around in the powder and then dying.  They are eating the sugar and simultaneously being poisoned by the borax.  The flour helps it to stick to them.  Just let them lay there, do not sweep them up for at least ten days.  After ten days you should notice that the glue traps are filled with roaches of all sizes and there are countless baby to medium roaches dead in the powder.Sweep up the powder and then immediately get a few cans of caulk and caulk every single crack that you can find in your entire house. This will take a long time but it must be done or else they will just re infest.  After the caulk has dried spray all seams between walls and the floor with raid daily for at least two weeks.At this point you should notice significantly less if not no roaches.  As long as you keep your house clean, i.e. do dishes immediately after using them, wipe up bathroom if it is wet after a shower, dont leave out food ever, etc. then you should be good.I apologize for the gratuitous bolded text but this is incredibly important, I have waged all out war with roaches for extended periods of time.  I have won some and lost some but I have slowly crafted this method and it has never failed me. I know it is an inconvenience especially the powder and not touching it because it basically means that area is off limit.  I would suggest to cover the entire kitchen and either eat out for two weeks or have a very thin path to the microwave or fridge that you can use to travel.  A few notes:Roaches love water. They love it. Never leave anything wetRoaches are tiny.  They can get through basically any crackRoaches swarm.  They are notorious for being incredibly persistent because they reproduce and swarm so quickly  Roaches are widespread. It is likely that if you are infested then so are your neighbors I would suggest talking to them to learn more about the situationRoaches must die.  If you ever to see one after this process, it must immediately be killed, preferably with raid in case any other roaches are aroundGood luck bud
How can I make squirrels leave my roof without poisoning them?
When I had problems with squirrels in my garden, I was told that using coyote urine worked as a squirrel repellent; litter critters are scared of big things like that, and leaving a scent is a good way to make them think that there's something scary that recently came to the neighborhood, and they'll leave.It may need to be refreshed from time to time, I think it's a week or two....try it, and see how long it takes for them squirrels to come back.You can find it on Amazon, for much cheaper than I was honestly expecting.Good luck! :)

How to generate electricity for free?
Yes and no.Any form of electricity generation can be used for free, if the source of power is free.So, if you get free gas, a gas generator can be used "for free". If you have free wind or sun, then you can get "free" wind power or solar power.If you can stick an inductance coil near a power line, you can leech power "for free", at least until you get caught and fined.If you stick a dynamo on your bicycle, you can generate power "for free" for as long as you pedal. If you live near a stream, or get free water, you can put one wheel in the water, and generate power "for free".There are a plethora of methods of providing small amounts of electricity to remote villages for lighting.The big problems with all this are:You're basically converting one form of energy into another, whether it's thermal, kinetic, or whatever. So, you need that form of free energy to convert from.As others have mentioned, there's often an initial outlay to harness/convert the energy.There's often a significant maintenance cost.Once you have the energy, you need to get it to the devices that can use it. Which means laying wires. More cost.Once you have it at the device (whether a mains device, or a battery) you then need to convert it to AC or DC, and step the voltage up or down and clean it to remove spikes and brown-outs and regulate it and smooth it and...There's also the cost of batteries or some other method to store any power you do not use immediately.You need to keep it safe for everyone who might come near it.If you have enough surplus that you want to sell it back to the grid, that's a WHOLE 'nother can of worms!

Also there is Peltier element (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect) which can be used to convert free "heat" to electricity.Peltier element allows to convert temperature difference to the voltage and vise versa. You can use any source of heat to produce electricity in that way (fire, sun, hands lots of them). See the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzTn9GtSpEU

If you have a chimney you'll also probably have one of those fan on top. They tend to spin quite fast.You could combine that with a dynamo or better a DC electric motor (dynamo are usually offer more resistance and could stop the fan) to generate power from the wind. Where I'm from is not particularly windy, but the fan is ALWAYS spinning, I guess because of the air flux induced by the chimney.Then you'll want to plug your home-made-windmill to a battery, so you can use the generated electricity when needed.Be sure to put a diode in the circuit or you'll end up with the battery powering the motor ;)
How to cut paper without scissors?
You can use thread or string or copper wire or any thin wire.first fold the paper and then place the thread between folded paper, fix the one end of thread and pull the other end smoothly will cut the paper.I use to teach this method to small kids to cut paper straightly without getting ingured by knife or scissors.ThanksRajnikant Sharma
How can I charge my smartphone faster?
There really is no "fast" way to charge your phone. Via a computer, USB3.0 charges faster.You could buy a power bank. You can just leave it charging at home, and then take it later and use that to charge your phone. There are also some "on the go" chargers where you can put AA batteries in and use that to charge your phone.You could turn off the phone, while it is charging, so it doesn't consume power. Or turn it into airplane mode+turn off all not needed applications.Other than that, there is no safe way to recharge your phone "fast". You could also buy a phone that has changeable battery itself.
How to store loose CDs and other discs without scratching them?
I've been in the same situation and I've done three things :1. Single CD cases2.Plastic packet-type case3. External Hard Disk I use the single CD cases to store the games . Although it is not a suitable method for storing every single CD you've got , it can be used to store the important ones (ie. Console games,Premium software etc).I'm not sure what they are generally called as, but they're for single CDs or two(front&back) , cheap, prevents scratches and durable. I'll leave a description of it, since I don't know what it is called:Plastic packet with some kind of plastic fiber inside it to prevent CDs from getting scratched. It has two storage areas on either side. If you've a bunch of CD (less important but still useful) , the HDD is feasible, but of course, its time consuming to copy the files from the CD to the HDD.IMO the disk wallet is highly efficient compared to my amateurish suggestions :P 
How to store loose CDs and other discs without scratching them?
I use a CD "spindle" - you get them when you buy bulk blank CDs and DVDs.It tidies them up and keeps them relatively scratch free.   However, whilst it keeps them tidy it just transfers the problem down the line when you want to retrieve the CD from the stack... you have to be quite careful not to scratch them... probably best for archive CDs that you won't use very often.

They are not designed to be fixed, unfortunately. Often tiny bits of plastic break off that hold the key in place - even then the missing "key" might still work by tapping the rubber thing underneath.  When that fails its time to visit ebay for a replacement.  
How can I charge my smartphone faster?
There are numerous things you need to know about charging your phone in order to charge it any faster.Ampere is unit of current intensity. So higher amperage means more energy in the same time. It does not damage the battery if you charge with lower (or higher) amperage than recommended by the wall adapter, if it's lower it simply charges slower.USB 2.0 has a maximum of 0.5 ampereUSB 3.0 has a maximum of 0.9 ampere (only when transmitting data at SuperSpeed rates) or 1.5 amperea wall outlet definitely has enough ampere for all current types of smartphones or tablets, so it's down to the wall adapterSo check the wall adapter that came with your phone so you know which power source is fast enough for maximum charging speed. It should state how much ampere (SI unit symbol: A, often shortened to amps) the output got. Most common smartphones "need" (for fastest charging) 1.0 ampere, newer smartphones "need" 1.5 ampere and tablets even "need" 2.0 ampere.Turning your smartphone completely off increases charging speed to a maximum.as an alternative you can:use flight mode (already increases speed significantly)turn off wireless connections manually (Wi-Fi, mobile data connection, GPS, etc.)limit mobile data connection to GSM(these tips are also handy if you simply want to make your battery last longer)closing apps reduces power consumption as wellIf your smartphone drains the battery faster than before it could be a sign of the battery itself dying. This just happens; batteries have a limited lifetime but discussing how to increase battery life is a different topic.Sources:AmpereUSBExperience and research

How should I deal with boxes for appliances?
Unless you have kept all of the packaging with the boxes, such as styrofoam inserts and other such pieces to keep your stuff completely immobile, there is no good reason to keep the boxes. Go to your local grocery store and ask for boxes. If you go to a big store like Walmart at night and talk with a stocker, they get rid of hundreds of boxes a night and are usually totally willing to give them to you. 
How can I charge my smartphone faster?
I don't know why @doug-watkins answer is being downvoted. Many newer phones allow for higher Ampier charging, but still ship with 1 amp chargers.http://9to5mac.com/2014/09/22/iphone-6-and-6-plus-faster-charging/Additionally, most car chargers and PCs can charge on USB ports, but these are much slower, and not as smart as the wall chargers you can buy.If you have a newer phone, look up it's charging spec, and then check your charger. If your charger says Output: 5V @ 1A, but your phone supports 2A charger, you could literally charge your phone almost twice as fast with a better charger. I never use my PC to charge if I can help it. It's slower, and can, from what I understand, damage the battery because of it.Do some research before downvoting someone. Doug's answer is one of the better ones.

One more thought to add - depending on the particulars of the situation, canned (compressed) air can be used to blow out obstructions (food, hair, dust, whatever).  If the problem was caused by a now-dried spill of some sort, you can usually clean it out by using a q-tip moistened with a small amount of 70% rubbing alcohol.
Avoiding static electricity
Cold (winter) air has less water (moisture) in it. So, if you wanted to reduce static in your home, you could use a humidifier in the winter.Water in the air is what steals away extra electrons that hang out on us, so that's why it matters. To see the effect in real life, and how powerful it is, take a balloon and rub it against your hair or fleece. The rubber on the balloon will steal some electrons from you or the fleece. Now, turn on your water to a slow continuous stream, and hold the balloon next to it. You should see the water bend, trying to get to the balloon.http://lifehacker.com/5851341/how-can-i-avoid-static-shocks-in-the-winter
How can I charge my smartphone faster?
Short-circuit the USB data pins on the phone side, that's what the most powerful chargers do to tell the phone that it can draw the max amount of current without needing any digital negotiation (otherwise it would negotiate with the OS and only get 500mA).From Wikipedia :on a dedicated charging port, the D+ and D− pins are shorted with a resistance not exceeding 200 ohms ... A dedicated charge port may have a rated current between 500 and 1,500 mAI've built my adapter myself using two USB connectors (male and female) soldered by their power pins and the data pins bridged on the female (phone side) connector (the male/PC side data pins aren't connected) with a bit of heat-shrink insulation to protect it and hide the horrible soldering.Although this is against the USB standard, I have yet to discover any issue with it; all my devices work just fine and didn't go up in flames and in theory that shouldn't happen as there is over-current protection on the ports that will just shut down the computer if too much current is drawn. I'm saying in theory, just be wary of crap chinese gadgets with USB ports, as these ports have no such protections and may very well catch fire.
How can I charge my smartphone faster?
All USB devices are designed to work at 5V of voltage. Standard USB 1.0 and 2.0 current intensity is 0.5A but there are chargers which allow up to 1A current intensity and are still safe for the devices. With this higher intensity charging will be faster.If your charging is extremely slow it might be a problem with the cable too. You can try to replace it and see if that helps.
How can I charge my smartphone faster?
Something else to take into consideration, not really mentioned in any of the other posts, but does affect how fast the phone charges: Even if you had a charger capable of delivering as much current the device was wanting to draw, there is still a limit on charging speed that boils down to how Li-Ion cells charge.Most cells are happy (And by happy, I mean not-catching-on-fire) to be charged at somewhere between .5 and 1C, where C is the capacity of the battery with the units mangled. For example, my phone has a 2600mAh battery. Ideal charging rate would be somewhere between 1.3 and 2.6 amps. However, Li-Ions are also very temperature sensitive, which can lead to the not-happy fire scenario mentioned before, so most charge controllers also limit current when temperatures get too high. In most cell phones, I imagine the charge rate falls more towards the .5C range of things due to temperature constraints.Now, on top of all that, that's not all. The .5-1C charging is only good for about 70% of a Li-Ion charge cycle. Li-Ions also do not like going much above their rated voltage (somewhere around 1% or less, I think), and the voltage on the cell will rise as it charges, eventually reaching 4.2V. Once that point is hit, the charge controller will hold the voltage, and decrease the current, which is shown on the dotted vertical line on this picture.This is the reason why it always seems to take forever for your phone to charge for that last bit (I'm not exactly sure what drives the recharge rate in the constant voltage section of charge. I'm sure fun electrochemical stuff).So, the takeaway from this is your device will only charge so fast, regardless of how much current you can supply it.Source: http://www.ti.com/lit/an/snva557/snva557.pdf
Avoiding static electricity
I'd like to add to Magna's answer above by suggesting multiple humidifiers.  We live in a two story house with a wood stove.  The main living space has two ultrasonics and the bedroom has one. The woodstove, as a source of "free" heat for shoving more water into the air, has its own oldefashoined pot of water on top.  That manages to keep two cats and two people from sticking to each other.
Plucking a chicken without a machine
The automatic chicken pluckers you referenced are generally used in conjunction with scalding. I'm not sure how well they'll work without scalding, but I knew a friend who got by with the following set up:Scald (maybe optional?)Use a homemade plucker hacked together from a corded drill, a 4" PVC pipe, and 4 of the rubber fingers used in the automatic pluckers.The homemade plucker was assembled by drilling 4 holes at 90° each around the circumference of a short length of 4" diameter PVC. The rubber fingers were inserted in these holes, to form an "x". Then it was attached a cap to one end with a bolt inserted through the center and chucked up the bolt in the drill. Then the drill can be zip tied to a table or bench, and the trigger can be zip-tied down to keep it running.Be warned, it will send feathers flying EVERYWHERE!You can see a souped up version of what he used in this picture:(Image Source)

How to store loose CDs and other discs without scratching them?
I always use standard A4 printing paper. Very cheap and available almost anywhere.Put each disk on a piece of paper, right at the centre. Then fold the long edges, next fold the short edges, like shown in the picture. (Make it a reasonably tight fit, so the disk won't slide around inside this envelope, because paper is slightly abrassive, theoretically.)That's all. No tape required, the disk won't slip out of the envelope easily.
How to get rid of bandicoot around house
I'm not sure which state you live in but in NSW it's illegal to kill or trap bandicoots. There are a few things you can try to deter them-You can try using chicken manure or something with a strong ammonia smell- they don't like the smell of ammoniaYou can use large floodlights. They'll stay away from well lit areas as they don't like lightFailing that you could always try some fine wire fencing. Hope that helps.
Is there a non-mechanical solution to unclogging a sink drain?
Our kitchen sink clogged once after I used the disposal on potato peels. I ended up using the stopper, the plug used to fill the sink, like a plunger. So I would bet an actual toilet plunger would also work. I would recommend having one you only use on the sink though, don't want to be putting a dirty toilet plunger in your sink. 
Easy way to remove brand stickers in recyclable materials?
According to Stretcher, you can use the peanut butter itself!Smear the sticker with peanut butter. Let sit for a few hours. Then wipe the peanut butter and sticker off with a paper towel. For stubborn stickers, use a butter knife to gently scrape the rest away.Peanut butter works on all kinds of surfaces. I've even used it on my children's clothes when they've been washed and dried with stickers on them.
Is there a non-mechanical solution to unclogging a sink drain?
I learned this one at university (there were some bad kitchen habits there!).  Roll your sleeves up and half-fill the sink (warm water is best) - it wont drain quickly by definition. With palms face down, place one hand over the other, and both over the plug hole.Pump like CPR half a dozen times... then watch the water drain away :-)You are effectively using your bare hands as a plunger. My son's uni sink had been semi-blocked all autumn term... he was gobsmacked when I unclogged it in 30 seconds at Xmas.  Once you get a result you'll never forget this trick.  
How can I charge my smartphone faster?
Lots of nice answers here, some uninformed answers as well, but I think that most of them miss the actual point. Background:First thing that needs to be understood is that device called "charger" is nothing more than a dumb power supply. It has no intelligence beyond the SMPS controller, which tries to maintain output voltage as current requirements change.The charger itself is inside of the telephone itself and its operation can not be easily affected by the user.As others have mentioned, it's actually important to know how fast the phone can charge, that is to say what is actually the maximum current that the charger will take. The charger will monitor the actual battery state and it's up to it to do the "smart" part.Power supply: For fastest charging, the power supply needs to be able to provide as much current as the charger needs to charge the battery, plus all the current the phone itself needs to operate. That's why we have answer saying that turning phone off will speed up charging, since this way we minimize the power used by the telephone itself. It would be nice if we have some percents more than phone's maximum consumption, just to be safe.Next step, and the one most important, is getting the charger actually to tell the telephone how much current it can produce.As I previously mentioned, chargers are dumb, so there's nothing to actually talk to, and USB is basically being abused to carry high current. We do have some standards for charging over USB, but they were all bolted on the basic USB 2.0 standard as afterthoughts.Then we have the "smart" telephone/tablet manufacturers that are unsatisfied with standard options and want to have more choice. That's where most of the difficulty comes from. We already have one answer mentioning the Charging port specification and it is there where the main issue is. The pre-standard ways of negotiating higher currents are still there and are still making problems. Apples iDevices still use their resistor dividers to set the maximum charging current and those specifications can change over time (compare previous link with this). Furthermore, other manufacturers are pushing their own standards. Here is a picture for Samsung for example.So we need not only a high current charger, but we need a high current charger that will be recognized by the phone. Unfortunately, with exception of using the newest and greatest OEM chargers, there's little that can guarantee that a a power supply will be correctly detected by the phone. Some power supplies may mention how are they wired on the inside, so that may make the decision a bit easier for the end user. Otherwise, all that's left is looking for reviews and experimentation.Cable:Finally, there's the part of getting current from the power supply to the telephone.    One big problem with USB micro cables is that they tend to be thin! This can be a considerable problem for charging phones. A USB 2.0 cable will have on the inside at least 4 wires, and to pack those wires in a thin cable, the wires themselves need to be very thin. Then we have a problem of resistance of those wires. Quite often, it can be neglected, but in case of USB power supplies and micro cables, we are reaching the point where cable itself may be dissipating non-negligible amount of power and is affecting the output voltage at the device connector. In general, if we have telephone whose charger allows fast charging and we have power supply that can provide enough current, cable may end up being the limiting factor. Phone's charger is not perfect and it needs a bit of head-room to charge. Also chargers will often lower charge current, if they detect that the power supply voltage is sagging. Some experiment results published here tell us that iDevices will ramp down charge current based on voltage. So let's take a look at some numbers and cable marking. Here's a handy calculator for voltage drops. Let's assume that our charger will provide 5 V and can supply at least 2 A without any voltage droop. I'll also post results for calbe lengths of 3 and 6 feet. Traditionally, the thinnest USB cables will use a 28 AWG twisted pair for data and two 28 AWG wires for power. Let's take a look at some results with that cable.At 3 feet length, we have output voltage at the end of the cable of 4.22 V. With this, we're already out of USB specification. If we take 6 feet, that gives us voltage of 3.44 V at the output of the cable. Our device definitely won't be able to charge at high current using that cable!I we move a bit up and use a cable that has 24 AWG power conductors, we'll have output voltage of 4.69 V at the end of the cable, which is just good enough, but some devices will ramp down their charge current with that. If we go to six feet, we'll have output voltage of 4.38 V, which is outside of standard.If we move again up a bit to 20 AWG for power conductors, we'll have output voltage of 4.88 V at 3 feet length and this should be OK for charging, but iDevices will still ramp down their current. At six feet, output voltage will be 4.76 V, which is still OK. I've heard that there are also USB cables that use 18 AWG wires for power conductors, so let's take at some results with that: 3 feet gives us output voltage of 4.923 V, which is quite good and at 6 feet, we have 4.85 V at the end of our cable. This is also explanation why some "chargers" have nominal output voltage of 5.1 V, even though the standard calls for nominal output voltage of 5 V. With 5.1 V, our 3 feet 20AWG cable will have 4.98 V at its output, while our 24 AWG cable will have 4.79 V at its output.There are even special charging USB cables. Their magic is very simple: They are short and may use thick conductors, minimizing losses in the cable itself.Bonus: How to interpret USB calbe markings: Some cables may have inscription on them such as 28AWG/1P+24AWG/2C. First value is about the data conductors. We have one twisted pair of 28 AWG conductors for data. On USB 3.0 cable, we may see something like 28AWG/3P.  Second value is for the power conductors. We have two (non-twisted) wires of 24 AWG. The higher the second value is, better is the cable for charging. TL;DR: Determine maximum charge current for your phone, get charger that can provide that much or more and is wired for fast-charging your phone brand and get a short, thick USB cable for connecting phone to the charger.
How do I apply cold solid spreads (butter/cheese) evenly on breads/sandwiches in a short time?
I thought about this and came up with a solution. The problem is, the surface being applied to is not sufficiently rigid. Lay a plastic bag such as a ziplock bag out flat, then spread onto that. It will be necessary to mash a bit. Hold the plastic above the bread and flick the cold spread off onto the bread. It may come off in one piece, several pieces, or be crumbly. My visualization was being in a car with an ice chest containing food spread, and leaning over into the back seat while patient children waited for neat, perfect sandwiches.You can also spread onto a board or other hard flat surface, then hang that over the bread.Since the plastic bag is more flexible you may be able to push off from the opposite side and it will stick to the bread.You can also roll the plastic out from under the spread, leaving it on the bread. That's how I would do it, as I think about it more.
Is there a non-mechanical solution to unclogging a sink drain?
You can buy "Sink and Drain Unblocker" in 1 litre bottles for £1 in the UK. You normally use 500ml to unblock or 250ml for a "prophylactic" dose every couple of weeks. I've used the stuff and it does the job just fine.I also like to use dishwasher tablets to keep plugholes clean, for instance just drop one in the shower tray (away from where you stand) and let the water dissolve it into the plughole. I appreciate this may not work so well in a sink - but possibly the overflow could be used...?

How to fix stuck laptop keys?
Key mechanisms need to be dry with no oily substance and certainly no sticky stuff. Clean the keyboard. Especially clean beneath the keys that are sticking. If there are no broken pieces of plastic you should be able to make them work.After cleaning, tap the keys over and over until they unstick.If when pulling the key off, if you see a coiled spring, stretch the spring slightly, just a little bit, then replace the key. That usually does the trick. Do not stretch the spring very much.Pull the keys off and clean the mechanism and plastic underneath with a q-tip and alcohol.

How do I effectively remove dog hair from my car seat?
Soak the palm of your hand. Wipe the pet hair off in a downward motion. The hair will ball up and stick to your damp hand. This works because the hair becomes wet, therefore heavier. This results in it being unable to stick to your pants (or whatever surface you're dealing with) in response to static electricityBarely dampen a clean, regular kitchen sponge. Use a sponge mop if you're removing pet hair from a low-pile carpet, in which case the floor should be thoroughly vacuumed first. Rub the fabric, upholstery, or carpet with the sponge. The fur should roll up into clumps that you can pick off by hand.orPut on a latex glove. Rub the surface with it on. The pet hair should stick to your glove. This also works with rubber gloves or cloth gardening gloves with a rubber coating on the palm. A rubber bristle push broom can work in the same way on floors. Dampen the glove or rubber section of the glove for increased effectiveness.orInflate a balloon. Rub it across the surface that has pet hair on it. The static on the balloon's surface will attract the hair (and works on yours, too!), which you can collect and then re-use the balloon to get more hair.

How can I avoid getting static shocks in the winter?
You have a humidity problem, inside. If you have a hot air furnace supplying heat through your house, ask an HVAC company to quote you on adding a humidifier (several hundred dollars). If it's a boiler with baseboard...buy individual room humidifiers. Higher humidity makes the air more conductive and will allow the objects in the room to equalize their electrons on their own before you do! As far as being outside, yeah the other answers are the best.

How should I deal with boxes for appliances?
If it is possible to open the upper part of the box and the bottom without damaging the box, then you can fold the box and make it flat. When you need the box unfold and close the bottom and the upper part. The styrofoam you can put in some of the other boxes. This way you will not reduce the volume of all the boxes but only a part of them. The overall result will be decreased volume of some of the boxes.You can get rid of the styrofoam for some of the appliances which are more durable and for which is possible the protect them using "bubble wrap" and old newspapers.

Peanut butter is the best because they can't remove it from the trap: they have to crawl up there and WHAM they're gone.Needless to say, position the trap along the wall or wherever else they usually scurry.Another idea is, if you see the thing, use a shop-vac to suck it up.

I recommend spray foam insulation. Put plastic over the appliance so the foam will not stick. Set the appliance in the box. Spray the foam around the appliance. It's only necessary to fill the corners and maybe do a spot midway. Foam insulation is very sturdy, cheap, available, and emulates original packing.Do a Google search for "spray foam insulation for packing" to read more.

How do I apply cold solid spreads (butter/cheese) evenly on breads/sandwiches in a short time?
Cut a small piece of butter with your knife. Hold the knife with the butter on top for a few seconds above a lighter (or a candle, if you happen to have one on the table). The butter immediately will start to melt on its bottom side, so take care it won't fall down.Put the piece of butter on the bread and wait a few more seconds until the heat has distributed throughout the piece of butter. In the meantime, you can prepare another piece of butter in the same way. Then spread the butter with the knife.

I don't know how this wasn't mentioned before, but you can use 'anti-stress material', or 'bubble wrap' (whichever you prefer to call).It has 'pockets' of air with different sizes and resistence.It's easily obtainable and quite cheap (0.80€ per m2, in Portugal).After you are done moving what you want, you can releave the huge stress with it!Luckly, Wikipedia has an article about this.You just need to be sure to get enough to loop it 3-4 times.If you want to use the original box, you can!Just loop it fewer times and you are set!If you want, you can ignore the box completely and give it to the kids or the pets to play with.
Is there a non-mechanical solution to unclogging a sink drain?
For really tough clogs I suggest the use of a water bladder that goes on the end of your hose. Might be overkill for a typical clog in a bathroom drain, but if the clog is deep, hard to get to, past the p-trap a water bladder can do the trick. They are available in most hardware stores and online for about ten bucks.Included Image shows the principle behind how they work.

Which is the best lure to use on a mousetrap?
I've had pepperoni work best for me. Cheese and peanut butter were not touched even after leaving them out for days. Then we tried pepperoni and caught it within hours, during the day. I think that the common thread I am seeing between my experience and others answering here is the smellyness of the food. If it has a high amount of odor, it can be smelled, and thus attract mice, from farther away.

I am a fan of oatmeal and peanut-butter. a single oat flake glued to the trap with peanut-butter has never failed to get the mouse during the cold months. It usually works year round in urban areas, but is less effective in rural areas where there is crops during the growing season. On a farm I recommend a cat.
effective catfish bait that stays on the hook without aidel
You can take heavy-duty sewing thread and wrap around the bait several times. Wrap going down, wrap coming back, then tie off. Slide the hook into that and it will stay a long time.Better yet, get a bunch of nylon mesh tubing used for crafts. Cut off pieces an inch in length, stuff the bait into that, then place on the hook.http://www.cosplaysupplies.com/store.php?p=MJ-25402501-01
How to quickly clean car windows from road salt?
On clear days it is important to go to a car wash and wash fender wells. Otherwise salt will eat into the body. Road salt is corrosive. While there, wash the windows, too. Short of that, the window cleaners at the filling station have a scrubber on one side and a squeegee on the other. These work real well. Follow up with the paper towels provided.
How can I avoid getting static shocks in the winter?
There actually are gadgets for this. You can apply an anti-static car strip to your (duh) car, but there also are keychains that can discharge you. Best tips to prevent it are to add a safety pin on the inside of your clothing, use moisturizer before you put your clothes on, use a silicon-based styling product for your hair (hope you're not bald) and hairspray, be it on your hair or on your sweater. Do keep a distance when spraying. Hair spray is to style and fix your ... static ... hair, but it can also remove the static from your clothes.
How to quickly clean car windows from road salt?
Winter is freezing cold but there's snow!This leads to a hack that quite often helped me to clean those parts of my car that are not exposed to the windscreen wiper's washing fluid.I often just use a snow ball to remove salt and dirt from the side windows and the spotlights.PixabayThis works best in case it is not too cold outside or if the car was already heated.We could also use warm water or a windows cleaner to wash off the salt, but it may not be available or it freeze the minute we had applied it if the car was not heated up. There also is quite a risk that the water will flow into the door handle, the key lock or other parts that may get stuck on freezing.
How to draw geometric shapes without instruments or objects?
You haven't said what you're doing the drawing for, but I'm amazed you're even trying to draw these freehand - whenever I do a design drawing, there's no way I can freehand any of that stuff, especially to scale! Circles, straight lines and squares aren't too difficult though - I used to rummage in the kitchen equipment drawer and usually found something the right shape and size to draw round, (pastry cutters, tops off bottles, etc) and for larger circles, might use a saucer or a plate, depending on size. Squares, well anything box shaped of the right size, but parabolas and ellipses, that's another matter altogether - they should be mathematically accurate for one thing. I'm afraid in the end I had to resort to buying the right equipment.
How to draw geometric shapes without instruments or objects?
Always try to draw shapes and such things on squared or geometry paper as you can use the squares to keep sides of the shapes the same - you can break it down into quarters and draw one quarter and try and match the others to that one and it should come out pretty neat.
How do I apply cold solid spreads (butter/cheese) evenly on breads/sandwiches in a short time?
Heat up your knife before trying to spread If you try and spread the cold, hard butter  with a normal temperature knife you will encounter the issue that you are having.However, if you put your knife under a hot tap or even boiling water (steam from a kettle for a few moments should work too) will allow the knife to glide through the butter - firstly making it easier to separate from the block / tub of butter, and secondly will have slightly heated and melted the butter making it easy for you to spread onto your bread as you would normally.(fun fact time: this is also a good method when trying to scoop ice cream out of the tub - heat up the spoon before hand, work a treat)Some people I know actually leave their butter out in a butter pot type thing which eliminates the issue of you having cold and hard butter as it will out of the fridge so wouldn't cool down! This is something that you could think about if it interests you!

Heat water in two buckets using one immersion rod
Obviously You want two buckets to get hot At once due to simultaneous usage of hot water during the same period of time. The Best method would be To fill Both buckets and leave the rod in one of the buckets. Once it heats up and is ready for usage quickly just change the rod to hang in the other bucket and use the hot water whilst the other person waits. Or If you really are desperate buying a second rod is a must. It would cost you a little more money but would make life a whole lot easier. Unfortunately connecting metal wiring and trying to get the rod connected to another bucket is too risky and you may get electricuted. Do not try Funny stuff when handling water and electricity.

Which is the best lure to use on a mousetrap?
While I was in a rough time (I was living in an abandoned house), I've noticed something.This might seem idiot, but it may work very well.It did for me, the mice ate the food all the time!We had a closet and we tied it to the bar. The mice would do everything to try to get up there.Basically, put stuff with sauce. No, really!You grab a piece of bread and put some delicious sauce in it.Avoid artificial stuff. If you fry some meat, run a piece of bread in the frying pan and stick it in the trap!This worked great! (Left me without food a few times)Also, as mentioned in some answers, the placement is very important.But make sure that they feel the smell of the sauce.

How do I separate multiple 5-gallon buckets efficiently?
Tie a brick or other large weight to the outermost bucket with a strong cord. The cord should be looped around the body of the bucket so the weight hangs off to one side, and beneath. Hang the innermost bucket up by the handle. Wait several minutes and the stack of buckets will separate. Do this repeatedly until all are separated.If this doesn't work, tie another weight to the other side, again looping the cord around the body. Increase the amount of weight hanging from each side. The stack will separate.
How to cook without using electricity or gas?
As Doug said, solar cookers can be effective and energy-saving.Solar ovensHere are instructions from wikiHow how to build these.Method 1: Lightweight Solar OvenPlace a cardboard box inside a larger cardboard box and fill the gap with shredded newspaper, which will act as an insulator.Line the inside of the smaller box with black construction paper, to absorb heat.Cover each piece of cardboard with reflective material such as foil (secure it with rubber cement or tape).Attach each reflector to the top of one side of the box (use glue or staple).Prop each reflector up at around a 45 degree angle.Position the oven in full sun, place food in the smaller box, and wait for it to cook. sourceMethod 2: Heavy Duty Solar OvenCut a large metal drum in half vertically with a jigsaw (e.g. oil drum).Clean the inside of the half-drum thoroughly with a de-greasing soap (use a scrub brush).Size and cut three pieces of sheet metal to contour to the insides of the half-drum. You need one large rectangle for the curved interior and two half-circles for the end pieces.Attach the sheet metal to the inside of the drum.Paint the inside of the oven with a reflective paint rated for barbecues.Create a continuous metal lip around three of the four top edges of the oven. This will hold the glass top (which you will slide in and out through the fourth, open side) in place.Flip the half-drum over and apply spray-on insulation to the outside walls.Attach a base to the bottom of the oven (ex. a piece of wood, a square aluminium frame with wheels, etc.).Drill drainage holes in the bottom of the oven. This will allow liquefied steam that drips down the sides to escape the oven.Slide a custom-sized sheet of tempered glass into the metal lip.Insert a magnetic thermometer.Place a thin aluminium grill along the bottom (optional).Test your oven’s heat capacity on a sunny day. Though you can reasonably expect a max heat of between 250 and 350oF (90 and 175oC) depends on the size, materials, insulation and weather. Method 3: Solar Veggie SteamerUse 2 cardboard boxes with 1 inch (2.5 cm) different dimensions, 5 cardboard panels, one vastly larger than the rest, Styrofoam, transparent wrap, aluminium foil, black craft foam, black Tupperware (with lid), water, your favourite veggie, glue, and 5 sturdy sticks.Place the large box onto the large cardboard panel, glue in place. Place the smaller box inside the larger box, glue in place. Trim off any difference in height.Line the empty space in between the 2 boxes with Styrofoam (don't use glue). Line the inside of the small box with 2 or 3 layers of the black craft foam, then glue together. Completely line 4 cardboard panels with the foil and glue the foil to the cardboard. Try to avoid creasing the foil.Glue the panels at a 45 degree angle to the box.Cut a rectangular hole just large enough to slip the Tupperware through on one side of the cooker.Take the transparent wrap and stretch it over the entire mouth of the solar cooker.
How do I separate multiple 5-gallon buckets efficiently?
If the buckets have handles, try turning them upside down and stepping on the handle of the inside bucket. Grab the collar of the exterior bucket, twist, and pull. This is basically the "pull really hard" method but using your weight to hold one down makes it much easier.If you have a friend handy, you can each grasp a bucket while twisting / pulling. This is another variation of the "pull really hard" method but it requires friends and who has time for those?If you don't have handles or friends, you can try the inverse of the "cold water bath" by pouring hot water in the interior bucket and rotating it to get as much coverage as possible. If they're heavy-gauge plastic, this method may require really hot water or just plain not work. You could also try to get some soap down between the buckets but now we're to the point of creating a lot of cleanup once they're apart.You already know that it's all about breaking the vacuum. I've used wooden shims, flat head screwdrivers, and metal yardsticks in the past but that was with pickle buckets and they're pretty lightweight.If you have no handles or friends or hot water or soap or screwdrivers, then I say give up and go get ice cream.

Looking for a solution to store and carry my knife
I improvised my own case for my knife.1. Wrap it in a towel:2. Put the towel-wrapped knife in a pencil case, and close it:This seems to work, even though the knife is a little too loose in the case, in my opinion, though it doesn't seem to have an affect on the sharpness of the knife, since it's protected by the towel. I suppose I could stuff the case with more towels, or paper, but I don't think that's necessary.Bonus: if you use Japanese water stones to sharpen your knife, as I do, the case can double as a water container when you arrive at your destination, so you could soak those stones in it (as I do).While this won't help me so much for my special case, I noticed that a friend of mine improvised his own "case" for his kitchen knife, out of paper towel and aluminum foil:

How to remove ink from paper?
I am an artist, and I use black India ink on watercolour paper.  India ink is permanent and waterproof.I learned that I could use a sharp exacto knife and gently scrape the ink away.  It will rough up the paper a little, so you have to be gentle.However, I use quality India ink and quality paper.  The combination was that the ink would coat the surface of the paper, not seep down into it like when you use ink on plain old notebook paper.When I am in a situation where I can't actually remove the ink, I use opaque white gouache to cover it.  Gouache is better than white-out because you can paint over it, and it is also much thinner, so you can paint it onto fine lines instead of daubing it on with the typical white-out sponge. If you are trying to erase ink from a typical ball-point pen, there is a such thing as an "ink eraser" - which is usually a silvery gray colour.  It has a certain texture with some grit.  This works well for ball-point pen ink on notebook paper.  It can be a bit smudgy though.

If you happen to have any spare leather or thick material lying around you could try this method:Trace around the knife onto a piece of paperDraw the same shape around the knife outline - just bigger (the size you'd want a sheath to be)Get your material and place the paper over it and cut around your shape using a sharp knife like a scalpel or a Stanley Knife - do this twice so you have two cutoutsOn the inside of the leather / material, draw a sort of border (the area that you made bigger than the knife)Apply a strong glue suitable for the material you are using and compress using a stack of books or a vice if available and allow to dry and strengthen - alternatively you could stitch the material in order to keep it together.Add any decorations or a loop on the back so you can attach it to your belt, or you can just keep it in the sheath in a bag.Obviously I understand that a lot of people might not have leather just lying around to be cut up but you can use other materials in place - such as denim (as in dmcdivitt's answer) or even wood (probably need to be thin in order for you to be able to slip the knife into it)!

When removing a stain from white cotton linens does not work, what's the most effective way to remove all color from the stain?
Dyeing the sheet another colour won't work - the stains will still show because they won't be the same colour as the rest of the sheet. Its likely a bit late for anything to work now because you've probably damaged the fibres irrevocably with all that bleach, but I can't praise Vanish oxygen stain remover enough, though this isn't really appropriate because its not actually a hack, more for future reference. All I can tell you is, having spilt red wine on a plain white linen tablecloth (used only at Christmas) I soaked it in a bucket with the right amount of Vanish Oxgyen (powder) for whites for six hours, and was really surprised to see that not only had the red wine gone, but so had the 5 or 6 Christmas pudding stains from the previous 3 years.Burn marks will never be invisible, whatever you use, the only answer is to cut them out and patch the sheet. I'd just buy a new sheet if I were you...

How to improvise a mesh tea strainer or filter?
After looking at a tea strainer on Google something immediately came to my mind, however it will involve perhaps demolishing a sieve.If you happen to have an old sieve that you are willing to modify somewhat then that's great - carry on reading.Step one:Remove the old metal mesh from your old strainer, some wire cutters would work on a stronger metal but scissors may work or you may even be able to push the metal out.Step two:Remove the metal mesh from your sieve and cut out a square / circle or whatever of the material the same or a similar size to the piece that you have just removed from the old strainer.Step three:Insert newly made mesh into the old casing and seal it down with some glue - leave to dry for a day to make sure that it is fully cured and won't get into your beverage.Step four:You should now have a makeshift tea strainer thing - probably won't be as fine a mesh than the original but should suffice for most tea leaves.Note, if you do not want to use the old casing you can probably makeshift your own out of paper clips or metal wire and shaping them into whatever shape you want it and then making a cage like thing with the sieve mesh.Another method I found when looking for a different solution to your problem is to use some tin foil. I'll summarize the contents of the link I have attached:Cut a foot square of tin foilFold in half twice so it is now a quarter of the original sizePour tea leaves into the centerBring corners together above the leaves and twist them together making a sort of stick - you'll end up with what looks like a tin foil ball on the end of a tin foil stickWhen you are ready to brew your tea, poke some small holes in the tin foil ball with a cocktail stick or similar and then brew in the normal way for the normal amount of time!Here is what it should sort of look like:Good luck.

you can easy amend/alter a wooden box like this one hereon the ground fit in a felt or a foam material.in the lid of the box stick on with wood-glue, 2-3 small wood-cames or a wood-bar, that fixes this nice knife down in the box.  this wood-boxes you can find easily on amazon or in your local hardware-stores.if the box comes without a lock you can easy make your own or you take a strong rubber-band.  before you fit in the felt or foam at the bottom, you may must also underlay a wood-bar (in the lenght of the blade) to prevent bending the knife.this may now sounds like lot of work, but with a saw, glue, a knife and some small wood-bars, you can make an easy and nice little knife-storage-box.
When removing a stain from white cotton linens does not work, what's the most effective way to remove all color from the stain?
For any permanent-set stain that could be described as being a "warm" color (red, orange, yellow, brown), your next-to-final resort (after heavy-duty cleaners like the aforementioned oxygen bleach) to bring the fabric closer to its original color might be bluing. Essentially, the concept is to use a diluted permanent blue dye to offset the current color of the stain; this will make the stain appear lighter in color, possibly even light enough to pass for the original color of the rest of the fabric. Bluing is normally used in extremely-diluted form to offset the natural off-white color of bulk "white" fabrics to make them appear whiter, so proper application directly to a stain will take some work:Grab some good rubber gloves, and get yourself a bottle of bluing.Dilute a single drop of bluing with cold water in a small disposable cup (start with a barely-blue mix, and try again with a stronger mix if that doesn't do the trick; it's easy to overshoot, so take it a step at a time).Go at it with a cotton swab, small paint brush, or other high-precision applicator.Make sure not to overshoot past the edges of the stain, or you'll end up creating a halo of blue around it!(Note: It may be possible to use some sort of thickening agent like baking soda or corn starch to make the solution easier to apply, but I've yet to attempt such a thing.)Once you've worked the bluing into the stain, let it set a few minutes (exact duration isn't critical; longer sit times will increase the effect to some extent, but don't let it dry or soak into the surrounding unstained fabric).Carefully hold the stain directly under a faucet, and run warm water directly through the affected area until you are good and certain that there's no bluing left to mess up the surrounding fabric. For good measure, consider lightly scrubbing the area with a dab of detergent afterward.Let it dry (preferably by hanging), then survey your handiwork. Depending on the original color of the stain, your end result can be expected to take on a lighter, possibly grayish hue, but it should be noticeably closer than what you started from. The decision of whether or not to try again with a stronger concentration depends on the color of the remaining stain. If you would still describe it as a "warm" color (red, yellow, etc), then you're okay to try again; if you would now describe the stain as a "cool" color (or a completely neutral gray, for that matter), however, then there's nothing left to be gained by this method. (On a similar note, permanent-set stains in "cool" colors like blue and green may possibly be offset with diluted permanent dye in a "warm" color like red; that's an unusual problem to have, however, so you'd probably end up spending more on specialized supplies than you would on a new sheet. I've also never attempted this reverse-psychology bit myself, so attempt at your own risk!)If all else fails, then your absolute final resort is indeed good ol' white fabric paint (or regular white paint, or white silicone caulk, or any of a number of other substances infamous for causing permanent white stains). These substances will all cover the fabric fibers entirely, masking the stain at the cost of changing the fabric's texture. If you're okay with that, then have at it!
Heat water in two buckets using one immersion rod
Assuming that you want to do both buckets at once because you wish to avoid having to swap the heating rod between the two buckets:The simplest way is to use a larger container that can hold at least as much water as both of the smaller buckets combined. That way, the water itself will serve the purpose of circulating the heat, and your two smaller buckets are at the ready for whenever you need them. If the larger bucket has a spout at the bottom (or some other simple way of getting the heated water out), then you can keep both smaller buckets at the ready and fill them when you need them.
How to rid toxic all purpose cleaner?
I did some reading on this. Wikipedia says the following which I checked elsewhere:2-Butoxyethanol usually decomposes in the presence of air within a few days by reacting with oxygen radicals.[12] It has not been identified as a major environmental contaminant, nor is it known to bio-accumulate.[13] 2-Butoxyethanol biodegrades in soils and water, with a half life of 1–4 weeks in aquatic environments.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-ButoxyethanolThe product "Simple Green" is considered to have low toxicity, which means there isn't much to worry about. Only with extreme concentration is there a concern.From what I read, allow the shelf to air out over a few days if you have concerns.
How to re-form a bent paper clip?
You can never fully return the paper clip to it's original state:There will be slight irregularities in the straight portions requiring special equipment to smooth out.Curves will not be in exactly the same place again and special equipment would be required to come close.Wire thickness has become irregular and cannot be restored.The metal is weakened due to additional bending.Having pliers would help you come close, but how close? Such is subjective. Maybe you can make a workable paper clip again, but the question asks how to restore to the original shape, with a picture, which is impossible without special equipment.

How to remove laptop security cable without damaging the the laptop
You only really have three options here, and the choice boils down to how much you value your time and money.Method 1: The Easy Way OutTravel as far as necessary to find a real locksmith, and pay them to take care of it.(Alternatively, mail the entire computer to the locksmith, and hope it gets there and back in one piece.)Bonus: the locksmith can also make you a new key, so that you can reuse the cable lock.Cost: high.Time: low.Method 2: Pick the LockDue to their construction, tubular locks are quite well protected against any improvised method of lock picking. For example: even if you rigged up some method of picking an 8-pin tubular lock one pin at a time by hand (using a rolled strip of metal cut from a soda can, perhaps), you'd quickly find that the pins spring back with more force than can be counteracted by friction alone; you'd need to actively hold all 8 pins in place at the same time in order to get it to turn. Additionally, since any of the pins can just as easily pop into their neighbor's slot, you may end up having to solve the entire lock all over again another 1-3 times (depending on how far it must be rotated before it releases). Long story short: some models may have specific weaknesses that can be exploited, but in general, you'll need to buy yourself a purpose-made lock pick. After you have a lock pick on hand, the process is pretty straightforward!Bonus: with the use of a lock pick, measurements of each pin can easily be taken. This information can then be used to create a permanent key, and the cable lock can be reused.Cost: moderate.Time: moderate.Method 3: Destroy the LockDepending on the make/model of the cable lock and the make/model of the computer in question, this method may or may not be practical for your application. The gist of it is to cut apart the body of the lock, exposing the two-piece core: these are the two-peg outer core and the T-shaped inner core that rotate relative to each other to engage/disengage the lock. Once the outer lock mechanism is completely cut away, you should be able to rotate these two pieces by hand, releasing the computer from its grip.Cost: low (assuming you already have the necessary supplies).Time: high.Tools needed (alternatives given where appropriate):  Rotary tool with diamond-grit cut-off wheel to cut the lock open (some lock components will be hardened tool steel; you can try using other cutting tools like a hole saw or jumbo bolt cutter, but they may not, you know, cut it.)  (optional) Painter's tape to protect computer surface from the adhesives used by the following other tapesDuct tape to seal all computer openings, cracks (metallic dust will fry a computer very quickly if you let it; packing tape might also do the trick)Foil tape to protect immediate surrounding surface of computer from sparks (painter's tape will burn, and duct tape will melt; regular metallic foil might work, if you use a couple of layers and secure it well enough)Big ol' pair of pliers (pipe wrench, vice grips, what-have-you) to hold the lock steady without putting your hands in harm's wayGood solid pair of safety glasses--or even better, a full face shield (your eyeballs don't like flying specks of red-hot steel any more than your computer does)(optional) Good pair of work gloves (must be heat-resistant; rubber and artificial fabrics are prone to melting to your skin, which would be worse than not wearing any gloves at all)Shop vacuum and damp rag/paper towel to clean up metallic dust before removing tape afterwards (damp rag is highly recommended; vacuum is optional)Notes about technique:Back up the computer's contents first. This will probably void your warranty.If teardown instructions are available for the computer, look them through; if it's possible to remove all of the sensitive electronics from the portion of the case where the lock is attached, it may be worth doing so.Be thorough about protecting the computer with the tape. Even the tiniest of openings could let in a computer-killing flake of dust!Clear a good-sized workspace on a flame-resistant surface (no veneers or other "pretty" surfaces, although a solid wood work bench would be fine) with plenty of ventilation.Take it easy. Cutting hardened steel too aggressively can result in damage to your cutting tool, the computer, and yourself if you're not careful.Position the cutting wheel such that sparks are directed away from the computer (and away from yourself, for that matter). The foil will help, but not that much!Take it in stages. If the lock heats up too much from the friction of the cutting wheel, it could damage the computer.
How to cook without using electricity or gas?
Google the "Woodgas" camping stove - it burns pretty much any dry woody leafy fuel pretty smokelessly, but has to be outdoors. It works with a small battery-assisted fan. Allegedly designed to help third-world countries by minimising smoke pollution. I have one and it is very effective and leaves minimal ash.  However the fuel load is fixed (although the stove comes in various sizes/loads).  Mine works for 10-15 minutes and its done. Stop and reload.  Great for fry ups while camping.  Works when there is no sun too !

How to remove laptop security cable without damaging the the laptop
I recommend cutting the cable next to the lock mechanism. This will allow use of the laptop and moving it. When time and circumstance permit, remove the lock mechanism. Taking it to a repair shop would be a good idea and not cost much.Locks do not prevent theft, but make theft more difficult. Someone can't just pick it up and walk off.
Heat water in two buckets using one immersion rod
It might work just under very specific conditions, but here it goes:  you will need two buckets, one smaller than the other, and the smaller one has to be made of a conducting material (any non-painted metal would do, I guess).  Put the smaller bucket inside the bigger one, and fill both with water.  The smaller one will be filled like always, but the bigger one will be filled just in the sides, as it will contain the smaller one inside.  Put the immersion rod in the smaller bucket, and turn it on.Once the water inside the smaller bucket is heated, it will start heating the water in the bigger bucket, as heat will be conducted through the metal. Some heat might get lost during the procedure, mostly due to the metal used I guess. 
How to clean eyeglasses if no cleaning cloth or cleaning spray is available?
When I don't have any cleaning cloth with me I use my T-shirt and I blow softly with open mouth on the glasses to achieve soft condensation on the glass surface. This is needed as you should never rub you glasses on dry surface because you can scratch them.The condensation that is formed on the glass surface is not saliva it is almost clear water and this method works well.The T-shirt of course should be clean and not sweaty and I use only 100% cotton T-shirts. Microfiber probably work well as cleaning cloth is made of this material, but I guess microfiber T-shirts are not very popular. If you have been working on a dirty place with lots of dust then do not use this method.I wear glasses all day for almost 6 years and clean them 3-4 times a day and never have damaged them using this method.
Find out if an egg is boiled or not without cracking it
Shake it in your hand. If you hear it sloshing around inside, it's not boiled.For the future, you may also wish to store your eggs in a vault, where pranksters can not access them.
Find out if an egg is boiled or not without cracking it
As a non cooked egg is fluid inside we can make use of the rotational energy stored there. Put an egg on your desk and rotate it fast (like a gyro). Then apruptly stop it with a finger, then release it again.Case egg was cooked:The egg will immediately stop spinningCase egg was raw: The fluid inside will continue rotation, hence making the egg start rotating again.
Find out if an egg is boiled or not without cracking it
Option 1) Put the egg in water. A raw egg will have a tiny stream of air bubbles.Option 2) Shine a strong flashlight through it. A raw egg will show light all the way through.Option 3) Spin it on its end. The sloshy innards of a raw egg will cause it to wobble and a cooked egg will spin smoothly.
How to open a privacy lock doorknob without the key?
As you mentioned, a small flat screwdriver works best. However, you can use basically anything that's thin, stiff, and non-round. I used to do this all the time to my brother to piss him off (ah, youth).Some of the things I've used:The metal clip from a cheap penA paperclip with the very tip bent to a 90 degree angle (to simulate a screwdriver)A safety pin (bent like above). Works a bit better, due to stiffer metal.The end of an old tangled up Slinky (bent straight)A metal coat hanger with the tip hammered flatCreativity goes a long way here.
Find out if an egg is boiled or not without cracking it
What's with all those complicated answers? There's a very easy way to check, one that I always use when I don't know if an egg is boiled or not:Simply put the egg on a flat surface and spin it fast. If it's boiled, it will continue spinning, otherwise it will stop in 1-2 seconds.EDIT: As Peteris suggested in his comment, basically a boiled egg will behave as a solid object. So, try to spin your egg 5 full rotations in one push. If you can't make it, it's not boiled.

How do I prevent my shirt sleeves from twisting in the washer?
The solution is in the dryer, not the washer. When putting shirts in the dryer pay attention and stretch the garments out. There is less control in the washer. How they go in the dryer has more significance.Shirts are either permanent press, or require ironing. Either way, do not remove 100% of the moisture in the dryer. Only remove 70%. If slightly damp, clothes will air dry the rest of the way even if folded. For permanent press clothes, leaving a slight dampness will allow wrinkles to fall out when placed on a hanger, or pressed out if folded and placed with other clothes. If ironing clothes, the dampness will help when ironing.
How do I remove burned-on gunk from an enamel stove-top without using harmful chemicals?
Use a green plastic scouring pad. These are very effective. You can rub very hard without the fear of scratching or discoloring the surface. Use plastic tools, push hard repeatedly, and attempt to chip away. Spray degreaser on the area, let it soak, then try again later. 
How to clean a baseball cap?
The cap has no oil stain, which is good. I recommend power washing with a hose. Because fabric on the bill of the cap is not flexible, the dirt cannot be worked out, and rubbing the bill of the cap may set the dirt. Power washing with hot water will flush the dirt out. Add soap and rinse the soap through the stiff parts of the cap, then rinse again to get the remainder of soap out. If there is no oil or grease component, all should come out.

The flat end of a cheap teaspoon. Not all types work though, more expensive teaspoons often have fancier handles that won't work.It's stronger then most other methods using paperclips or other improvised things and you don't have to hammer anything flat.If you don't care about the spoon you can bend it in the middle for extra leverage.
How do I prevent/fix holes in the front pockets of my jeans?
RepairFront pockets of trousers are usually made of soft fabric that will be much less resistant to mechanical strain.There are two instances the pockets get holes:1. The fabric becomes worn outWe then have to either sew in a patch, hoping it will hold for another few months. There are also patches to apply with an iron but they usually won't last too long to my experience.Replace the whole pocket with a new one (preferably with a better fabric quality). This will involve quite some knowledge in sewing, hence I let somebody else do that for me.2. The seam gets looseThis can mostly be fixed easily by just stitching it on againPreventionThe obvious thing to prevent this from happening is to keep all sharp edged things out of our pockets. This is true for coins, keys, lighters, swiss army knifes or other stuff real men love to carry close to their legs.Now being a real man, I can't think of a life without all these items im my pockets. Therefore I came to the conclusion I need to put my keys into a special bag or pouch. This could be anything from a small self-made linen pouchto a commercially available leather bag with a zipper.These are not really cool fashion items as we know them from our daddies or grand-daddies (they might know why):With some search effort we may howver even find a design that may be acceptable for us:  Images from a random search at Amazon

How to clean a baseball cap?
The first thing to do is not wet it - let it dry out completely, take a stiff brush (something like a vegetable washing brush or a stiff nail brush), go outside with the cap and scrub at the mud till you've got most of it off. Provided its only mud, most will come off - my cap's black, so that's all I need to do, although if it still looks a bit 'grey', I rub it over with a damp cloth afterwards. If yours isn't black, you may then need to do something 'wet' as suggested in another answer.
How can I store my Christmas lights so that they don't get tangled?
Seeing as how I usually have some new cardboard boxes lying around when it's time to take down the lights, I tear off chunks and wrap my lights around them, similar to what's shown below. Typically, I'll cut notches along two sides so the cord sits in the notches and won't slide around. That lets each coil be closer to the next as I'm sure they won't tangle. It's cheap, lightweight, effective, and easy to unwrap next year.
How to rehang a door by myself?
There are plenty of advice available on Internet (for instance, examples here and here).In addition to the tips mentioned there, I would just add a few:If there is another person available to help, that would be excellent.Use anchors in the screw holes, if the screw holes are not damaged.If possible, use slightly longer screws. For example, use 1.25 inches, if 1 inch screws were used previously.You need to use caution not to use a screw which will pass through the door frame, or damage it or the wall.Place small wooden pieces underneath the door so it would can be leveled easily with the hinges. Holding the door may not result in best results.Good Luck.
How to rehang a door by myself?
Take three pieces of 1x4 about a foot long and ripped one piece a little larger than the width/depth of the door (about 1 1/2in).  Then nailed them together to form a U shape with the ripped piece at the bottom of the U.This setup gives some support to keep the door vertical while attaching to the frame.
How to secure a TV in a car while moving?
If you have space to lay it down, do that. This is probably only possible if you can fold the seats forward so the TV is laying both in the cabin and the trunk. Cushion it with soft things underneath and and on top in case something rattles around and lands on top.If you can't do that, stand it up in the backseat. Cushion it with pillows and large blankets or comforters on both sides. Use the seat belts to hold it in. Most seat belts are built so that the retractor locks if you pull the belt all the way out. It's designed to help install child car seats but it'll be useful here. Pull the belts all the way out and let it back in a bit. If you can't tug it out again, then it's locked. Wrap them around your cushioned TV and buckle them in. Let the belt all the way back it, making sure it stays locked. You can even tug it a little tighter - pulling away from the buckle and helping it retract a bit more - for a snug fit.The belt will unlock again once it gets retracted enough so it's possible that'll happen here. Add some more cushions to force the belt out more and try again. You should end up with a snug, cushioned fit.
How can I store my Christmas lights so that they don't get tangled?
I wrap them round a magazine (top to bottom), fold the magazine in half (left to right) then put each string in a carrier bag. Since doing this I never get tangles.But I'm not really posting about Christmas lights - I'm posting about this:My usual method is the same one that works well for extension cords... I hold one end in my hand and then start looping the cord from my handle to elbow. Once I'm done with the entire cord, I slide it off my elbow and I've got a the cord wrapped in a circle.You should almost never wrap a cable around something as it twists the cable and will weaken it over time.A few things you can do to avoid this include:Coil the cable in a figure of eight. The twists will cancel themselves out.Fold the cable in half, then in half again. Once it gets to a reasonable length, tie a loose knot in it, or secure it in some other way. Note that most of the time when you buy devices with cables, they provide the cable folded then secured with a bit of insulated metal wrapped around it - this is because it causes the cable very little stress.Use the under/over method. This involves coiling the cable in alternating directions - this means that twists in the cable are cancelled out and not aggregated (like the figure of eight method).Wind the cable around something. Note I'm distinguishing between this and wrapping. You'll notice that when you get extension cables (esp. mains extension cables) which are long, they come with a spool which rotates. This doesn't twist the wire at all and keeps stress low, prolonging its life.Sorry my post is mostly about a part of your question you perhaps didn't want a comment on, but I thought you might be interested.Some interesting links:Naxos Blog: Make your headphones last forever: suggests the figure of eight, and the folding methods.How to wrap cables and avoid a tangled mess: very well written article which suggests the under/over method.Youtube: How to Wrap a Video Cable Properly!: explains the over/under technique.
How to hold a microphone on a stand that is too small?
An actual solution from this Lifehacker ArticleThis uses only a wire hanger"Just take a metal hanger, bend it in half a little, then bend the hook down and adjust as necessary. It's pretty stable, being what it is."To attach this to a stand that you already have, you can cut off some of the wire and then attach the rest of it to the stand with glue or tape.My made up solutionDisclaimer: I've never had this problem, this is something I made upFirst get a piece of construction, or some other type of sturdy paper that can bend. Shape the construction paper into a cone and then put the microphone in. Allow a hole big enough for the back of the microphone to fit through. Then use scissors to cut off most of the construction paper, but not too much because you don't want the microphone to fall out. Then just use glue or tape to attach the paper in the holder if you can (just the back of the paper) or on top of the holder. Not sure how well this will work because I've never tried it before.

How to secure a TV in a car while moving?
Use the passenger seat belts with cushions.Make sure there are no loose items that can fly into the TV.
How to secure a TV in a car while moving?
If it is a tube-type TV, lay the TV screen-down on the back seat to protect the screen. Any seat belt buckles should be pushed out of the way. Pull a seat belt and shoulder harness around the TV. If unable to do that, place the TV at the front of the seat so it rests against the forward seat back.If it's a wide screen TV, protect the screen. If the TV will lay screen-down on the seat and not contact any seat belts, do that, but seat belts cannot simply be moved out of the way. They will rub on the screen surface and damage it. If the TV cannot be laid screen-down, but will lay screen-up do that, but insure nothing will fall on the screen. If the TV is too big to lay on the seat, place the top of the TV at the rear of the back seat and lean the TV forward so it rests against the front seat at an angle.If you have nothing else in the car with the TV there is no need for any blankets or cushions. The interior of the car provides enough cushioning. Insure the TV does not rest against anything hard.The question is how to transport a TV; not a bunch of stuff in the car. If other items are carried too, use sufficient padding between items.
How to hold a microphone on a stand that is too small?

Removing / Minimizing a car dent?
Short answer, no, unless you have a friend who is or was a panel beater. I'm surprised it took you 'some time' to conclude that violence wasn't perhaps the best reaction to your situation, I'd have realised it immediately, but there you go, we're all different.The  lesson is one for you rather than the car regarding future behaviour on your part though, along with perhaps watching that episode of Fawlty Towers where John Clees beats the c*%p out of his broken down Mini with a branch off a tree - that's probably what you looked like when you were venting your spleen, must have been funny to watch. Next time, just kick the tyres, if you must.If the dent is in a door, you could try removing the door panel on the inside and trying to push the dent outwards, but even if you do, you'll still be able to see it isn't perfectly shaped and smooth from the outside.
Heat water in two buckets using one immersion rod
I will assume you have two Home Depot style buckets of the same size that need to be heated at the same time and for the sake of not having to monitor, you want them to simultaneously heat until both are at about a heated equilibrium. Efficiency is also not a factor.The hard way:I seem to recall this exercise that should when scaled fit your purpose..if I recall it correctly.You will need a 6-12" platform, a two fuel siphon hoses or equivalent garden hoses, clamps, and a weight of some sort in addition to your immersion rod and buckets.Place the immersion rod in the lower bucket. Then place the first hose a couple (1-2") under water inches of each bucket. Then place the second hose laying sideways or 1" from the bottom of both buckets. Important for this to work when placing those hoses initially you have to have vacuum (water filled with pressure) in each hose. The Easy Way:Alternately you if want guaranteed circulation, I would just get electric utility pump, depending on purpose use of water a submersible utility / sump pump,  or one they sell to fit directly on top of the Home Depot style buckets, not if two pumps they need to have the same flow rate. They also sell ones specifically for recirculating/mixing ( 2x in / 2x out) so you don't need two pumps just one. This would allow you to for go / skip the elevation, maintaining vacuum, and whole physics hassle.
How can I keep my door locks from freezing during a winter storm?
There is a couple tried and true methods used of varying difficult from living in AK and ND.1) Install a storm door. This will provide other additional benefits as well. Should have no frozen up key lock issues after that. $80 to hundreds of dollars, much easy to install yourself than a framed door.2) Go to a keyless lock. $60 to hundreds. Just keep in mind they use batteries.3) Use a rubber fruit preservation cover for the door knob to cover the lock. They sell them at the grocery store and online but you need one door knob size but that will also slip on and not come off and last. $5-15, May not work for all doors / knobs. Some lock smith shops also sell one designed for locks. If you are handy you could also make your own using the tool coating rubber they sell at hardware stores (but don't build it on the knob!!!!!).4) Modify a winter outdoors spicket / water faucet cover to place over door knob.. This does though usually involve adding a sticky hook to the door so the covers nylon or rubber cord can attach to something. I recommend the plastic coated ones, not just the foam ones. $3-$6 5) 1/4,qt Ziplock Freezer Bag and a thick rubber or nylon cord that locks like the baby cabinet lock ones. You will have to replace the bag regularly. 6) For a frozen lock I use mini zippo lighter fluid containers as the tip works well for inserting into lock and it's nearly instant. Otherwise I use the containers refilled with isopropyl alcohol, but it's not quite as fast. (See note below)Other Notes: WD-40 , as recommended by others isn't a as reliable I personally find for frozen situations. Those lock deicers are just isopropyl alcohol ( $1 for 12oz vs $3 for 1 oz ) in a nice dispenser. I would not heat a key up, you weaken it and if it has a chip you could damage or destroy it. Duct tape or other gummed adhesive may clog the lock creating bigger issues, it tends to also be brittle at colder temperatures and not stay on. Important : lighter fluid, alcohol, and WD-40 are flammable and can damage paint as well as de-lubricate locks (WD-40 is a solvent not a lubricant), resulting in other issues with the lock and / or other property or personal damage.
How can I reduce the sound of clicking my mouse
Two options:Use a thick foam mouse pad.  Using a mouse on a hard desk will amplify the sound.Take the mouse apart and insulate around the click switches (see image).  Felt, or thin foam would suffice, but the key is to maintain the function while adding something to dampen the sound (Disclaimer: I have never done this!).Image of click switches where insulation is needed http://wejp.k.vu/images/mouse2.jpgAs a third more drastic option, you could try and replace the click switches with ones that are less noisy.  Most likely more trouble than it's worth, and I can't actually provide a product/catalog # for ones don't make a sound.
How to avoid the splitting of my jeans in the crotch area?
The holes develop for three reasons:The pants are being stretched excessively.The seat is rubbing on the pants.The fabric is not sufficiently durable.I ride a bike to work, so know from experience. Cheap, thin, coarse-weave polyester fabric is best. It is cool and doesn't hold water when you get hot and sweat. Not being jeans they are a bit looser and the fabric holds up better than denim. Such are surprisingly inexpensive costing less than jeans if one looks around. They can be bought at places like blair.com. I have several pairs from there lasting several years of daily bike riding. Riding a bike regularly requires a change in clothing style to facilitate comfortable riding.The seat can be changed. Harder seats work better than soft ones for several reasons, and you are best off getting a thin racing-style seat with a small bit of springiness to it. A racing-style seat will cause less wear to clothing and offers more comfort.

Removing / Minimizing a car dent?
There's at least a couple things that might just work in this case with removing/minimizing the dent. I wouldn't advise anyone with a nice car to try the following though.First thing you could do is just grab a toilet plunger and a cup of hot and soapy water, as shown by Taya05 on this youtube video. Then pour some of the soapy water on and around the dent. Lastly, just plunge in slowly and out quickly to try to remove or minimize the size of the dent. Second thing, if you're able to get to the other side of the dent, you could try hammering it out gently. To make this go more smoother, you could also maybe heat up the outside of the dent with a hair/blow dryer, to possibly make the metal easier to adjust out.

How to strip coating off of wires without a wire stripper
There are a variety of options. The thinner the metal wire and the more adhesive coating, the more difficult to strip.However, most coatings are plastic-based, and the wires are metallic, so to achieve your goal, you simply have to subject the wire to a treatment one can handle, and the other cannot. This could be chemical, depending on the type of plastic, or much simpler: Heat.Cut the wire cleanlyHold the end of the wire well above a lighter, or other direct source of heat (in a well ventilated environment)Move it closer to the source of heat, if the plastic is not shrinking / burningGently clean the last plastic residue off of the metal.Be careful with the gradual application of heat, because some plastics can get quite hot, and some metals melt easily. If you know the type of metal and / or plastic, obviously we could find a chemical more suitable. 
How to strip coating off of wires without a wire stripper
Another option I didn't say is simply to pinch the wire between the thumbnail and index finger and pull. The insulation will tear and will not damage the wire inside. Sometimes it helps to chafe the insulation a bit with the thumbnail before pulling. Be careful where the wire is being pulled from. It should be held by pinching with the other hand.I never use a wire stripper, but dikes or wire cutters. The dikes must be very sharp. I don't use my dikes for anything except cutting wire, and I don't loan them, which keeps them in good shape.Squeeze the wire slightly with the dikes at the point where the insulation should separate, then pull. The insulation will separate and slide off the end of the wire. The intent is for the dikes to cut through the insulation but not the wire, score the insulation, and allow it to tear the rest of the way off.More care must be used with thinner wire. If stripping very thin wire, use fingernail clippers following the same procedure. However, nail clippers will not offer a "feel" and with them it's easy to cut too deep, cutting the wire. Clippers do offer precise control, however. With practice they work well.Try not to score the wire when stripping. With multi-strand wire it's easy to cut some of the strands but leave others. Make a decision whether the wire is too damaged, needing to be redone. If being soldered, solder will flow up the wire a bit if done properly, strengthening it.What I would do in your situation is make a custom wire stripper using fingernail clippers by placing a piece of metal between the cutting surfaces, preventing them from coming together completely. You can then reach into small spaces, squeeze, and pull off insulation easily.Another method that works well is to roll the wire on a knife blade with your thumb, cutting the insulation completely around the wire, then slide off. For small wires this works well. It's not necessary to completely cut through the insulation, but score it all the way around. Doing this much will leave superficial cuts in your thumb, but it works well providing good control.

First, we must know why laptops overheat. All of the equipment inside a laptop, processors, RAM disks, hard drives, etc., work really hard, so the computer gets hot. Most computers have a cooling system on the bottom, but when the computer is on your lap or a table (mostly your lap) the vents of the cooling system get blocked, so the laptop overheats.Therefore, a very simple solution is to use an old egg carton. If you put the egg carton under the laptop, it won't overheat because the holes in between each egg holder allows air to circulate under the laptop allowing it to cool. Only do this at home, unless you want to look weird at a coffee shop or something.photo from Instrucatables
How to keep a laptop cooled down
After you've had the laptop awhile you should take it apart and clean the dust away by blowing or vacuuming. If uncomfortable taking apart yourself, take it to have it cleaned, which doesn't cost much. Sometimes blowing air back through exhaust ports will help, but the unit should be cleaned. While apart, inspect any heatsinks insuring they are securely fastened. Inspect fans and fan rotation to insure they work properly. With these things done there should be no heat problem, since the unit will be returned to factory condition.I wrote this for when the laptop cuts off due to heating.Setting on a hard surface should be sufficient when in use. Avoid placing on cloth or fabric which insulates and restricts air flow.
How to keep a laptop cooled down
Vacuum the ventsThe fans are designed to keep the components of your laptop cool. When the inside gets inevitably dusty, the fans have to work harder to be less effective. In the worst of cases, it'll look like this:In most laptops, using a vacuum from the outside will be strong enough to get most, if not all, of the dust. If you're comfortable doing so, I would still recommend taking it apart though.Place it on a book (or clipboard) on top of your lapThe fans are designed to blow hot air either to the back or to the sides, and suck air in also from either the sides or back. Placing the laptop directly on a fabric surface plugs the vents. Placing the laptop on a book, clipboard, or other hard surface between you and your lap will allow the vents to do their job.
How to strip coating off of wires without a wire stripper
There's a few options I can think of, ranging from safe to not the best idea, but it worksScore the insulation with a sharp hobby knife, and pull. Works for normal insulationHeat the insulation with a soldering iron. Don't breathe the fumes!. Works for some sorts of 'conformal' insulation, such as what you'd find in headphones. Its a dry heat so you're less likely to set the insulation on fire or cover it with soot.Microtorch. Its a 'cigarette lighter' with a much more optimal fuel mix, and burns with a hot, clean, blue flame. Fastest way to get headphone insulation off ;p. Unlike a cigarette lighter, you're not going to get soot, and a quick pass with the VERY hot flame works. Try not to use it for too long on the same spot since its hot enough to melt wire
How to strip coating off of wires without a wire stripper
A couple of options I have used.1) For internal telephone and network width cable (which cabling of similar width seems to be what you are working with), I have used the gap in my teeth on occasion when I have dropped my strippers. Many other times sometimes it is faster to do so as I could strip a pair at a time. As long as it is not connected to anything any moisture will be gone in a second or two.2) Use a large head flathead screwdriver, press it against the table with it up on one corner, pull the wire through.3) Run the wire through the teeth of a key pressing down with your finger.4) Use a set of nail clippers.
How to keep a laptop cooled down
This is an approach not discussed so far - taking into account all the physical considerations, like placing the laptop in a hard surface, clean the vents, and don't placing it near fabric, the only thing I can think of is taking care of it through the actual laptop's software/hardware settings:Make sure that the vents are working at full speed - for this, you may want to check the BIOS settings for an option to set the speed of the vents to a fixed value.  The most common way to access the BIOS settings is to power on your laptop, wait for the first logo to appear (generally, the logo of the laptop's manufacturer), and press F2 or ESC in the keyboard.  Depending on your Operating System, you may want to check the "Power Options" - if you set this to an option like "Power Saving" or "Balanced", you are (non-technical at all explanation) forcing the CPU to work slower, hence consuming less electrical power, therefore not heating up so much as it would in a "Best Performance" option. 
Get wax off of wooden table
Another way would be to heat it. It could be done with, for example, fan (wikihow, thriftyfun, yahoo). Then wipe the wax with something not really valuable, e.g. paper towels.Instead of fan wikihow also advices to use iron: put some cloth on your wax, iron it with low power, wipe the wax, wash your cloth (or just use paper towels again).
How to keep a laptop cooled down
If you have a container with the same size of the bottom of your laptop (or bigger), you can fill it with ice and cool water (water to have better contact with the top of container) and put your laptop on it. It wouldn't be permanent, but even when the ice will melt, the cold water will serve the cooling function (don't think that the water will get warm really fast).You can also use multiple small containers, but it will reduce efficiency, unless those containers are interconnected.Also: you can lean those containers to the wall, it will absorb the heat which these containers get from the computer (especially if it is cold outside).

How to keep your hands warm in winter while working on a laptop?
I'm well known among friends and family for always having cold hands. It's rare that I meet someone with hands colder than mine, other than my mom. I used to move one hand, then the other beneath a blanket, but I've recently found that that doesn't work so well. At least compared to this other method I've found.The problem seems to be that my shoulders leak a ton of heat when I have a blanket over me. Try using two blankets, one on top of you like a regular blanket, and (this is the important one) one over your shoulders and arms like some kind of cape. If you only have one blanket, make sure it covers your shoulders and try to cover your legs with some of it as well (assuming you want to use it as a blanket). It works like a charm. Something like this (please forgive my amateurish paint skills):Strangely, I don't even need the red blanket to cover my arms; with it just covering my shoulders, I get really warm and toasty. In case you can't decipher my amateurish paint drawing, the red blanket wraps around behind my neck and covers my arms from the top. The green blanket goes under the laptop and over my legs.
How to keep a laptop cooled down
I have seen this same problem with Toshiba laptops. Vacuuming did not do much to resolve.So off to computer technician who disassembled the laptop to clean the fan area.Noting that my computer draws air from underneath and exhausts to one side, I built a "box"....a sheet of 4-5 mm building board matched to the size of the case. Around the perimeter of this board I glued a series of blocks 8 mm high and 15-20 mm wide in the form of a dashed line " - - - - -". On top of the "dashed line", a solid piece of block continuous around the perimeters. Now cut a few slots in the continuous block for the "studs" or "legs" that support the case. The gaps between the dashed blocks are covered externally with a piece of fine muslin or cheese cloth glued into place. The face of the block meeting the underside of computer case is sealed with a strip of foam rubber ( 4 mm x 15 mm) such as found in hardware stores as window "draft stopper". The critical issue will be whether your box filter allows enough air flow, so maximise the gaps between blocksThis seemed to work for me stopping the accumulation of dust internally. 
How to keep a desktop computer cooled down
Building computers can be expensive and dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. No CPU that I'm aware of has a higher temperature rating than 75°C. If you're hitting 85°C without overclocking then you're about to destroy your computer.Check that you've used (enough) thermal adhesive between the CPU and the heatsink/fan.Try underclocking the machine. Or at the very least remove the overclocking.I would recommend checking your CMOS settings to automatically control fans.Also check that your fans are all working. From your picture it looks like they are.DON'T reattach the case wall until your heating problems are fixed. Look into a case with wall mounted fans. If you're still having troubles you can either replace the CPU or look into water cooling.If all else fails look into oil cooling.
How to keep a desktop computer cooled down
What damages the motherboard and chips are not the heat so much as change in temperature. Heating and cooling, heating and cooling, breaks down junctions within solid state components due to expansion and contraction. There is such a thing as "thermal runaway" however. As circuits heat up they conduct more which heats up more, etc., until the internals actually melt. It's OK if the machine gets hot, just not too hot. Insure it will shut down if it reaches whatever temperature.The info URL you provided gives information that may not apply to your machine. The temperature sensor you have may not be accurate. You may be warmer or cooler than what the read out says.What you might do is hold the fan with your hand, purposely allowing the temperature to run up and see if the machine keeps working OK. Watch the temperature indication rise a little further, then allow the fan to cool it back down. That will provide you a usable operating parameter. Just keep the indication below that from now on.If you are going to run at high temperatures, do not turn it on and off all the time, but leave it turned on.
How to keep a desktop computer cooled down
Based on your picture: Get a better CPU-Cooler!You already have some case-fans, hence probably already a good air flow.You're CPU-fan looks like a stock one. I had some problems with stock fans as well. I would recommend something like this, with copper conductor plus a fan.Scythe Mugen 3 RevisionI suppose you only get 85°C when gaming or doing other resource-heavy operations. I had the exact same problem and got the CPU cooler pictured above. Now my CPU has about 24°C when in normal operation and never goes above 45°C when gaming.Further recommendations:Zalman CNPS9500ANoctua NH-U14S & NH-U12SThermoLab TrinityCooler Master Hyper 212 EVOThermalright Archon SB-E X2 & Macho Rev.AThere are tons of good CPU coolers. These are just some I heard good things about. But always keep in mind to check, of course, the CPU-socket compatibility and the size of the cooler. If considering one that has a fan I would check it for the spinning speed and loudness (these two things are coherent: high RPM & small fan = loud; low RPM & big fan = quiet; low RPM & small fan = not very effective but quiet; high RPM & big fan = very effective, maybe still quiet). If you're checking one in an online store, reading the customer reviews tells you much about how effective it cools, how loud it is or how easy it is to install it.Two graphic cards also produce a lot of heat, but they should be able to cool themselves.
How can I quickly eliminate the smell of cigarette smoke in a confined space?
Other than Baking Soda, you can actually use activated charcoal or carbon.As normal charcoal wouldn't work due to the fact that odors are chemicals and absorbing them is a chemical process, that is why you'd need the activated charcoal.What is Activated Charcoal?Activated charcoal is charcoal that has been treated with oxygen to open up millions of tiny pores between the carbon atoms.SourceIt is freely available to purchase at a rather reasonable price. It isn't at all hard to find.Another alternative, that I've personally used (When my car stank of rotting fish) was crushed up coffee beans that seemed to absorb the odor quickly. After that, I used an air freshener to remove the coffee smell, and voila, it was gone. 
How do I make my smartphone battery last longer?
A few things I always do to try and preserve my battery life:Reduce BrightnessI always have the brightness as low as possible while not having to strain my eyes to see the screen - the dimmer the screen, the less power it uses. Also turn off auto brightness as this usually takes more battery than needed.Turn off WiFi and BluetoothAlways have these off when not in use (i.e.  out and about) as it will always be looking for a connection when not connected which will take more power.Put in Airplane ModeIf you are in a WiFi zone and you do not need cellular network (i.e. all messages are through iMessage or whatsapp or others) and you have no need for calling people, you can just connect to the WiFi network while not using your phones network which would draw more power than necessary if it's not needed. This will also help the phone to charge more quickly when you are trying to recharge the battery.Turn off Location ServicesMake sure than none of your apps are using your location while not in use (even while in use if you don't need them too) this can be configured in your settings and the less location services being used, the less power you'll consume, thus preserving battery life.Do Not DisturbPut it into do not disturb mode as this will stop it vibrating or going off if you get messaged - unless you always need to know when you receive a message.Don't Close AppsForce quitting all your apps regularly can actually be more power consuming so this method of battery saving is a total myth. There's a video about it here with more detail but in short - unless the apps are doing any of a few specific tasks, the phone suspends the task until it is re-opened, this means it uses zero processing cycles which means basically no power usage.Don't let it overheatI used to find my iPhone would get very hot when playing games or watching videos and this would reduce battery performance so if you ever find the phone getting hot then perhaps stopping what you are doing would be a good idea in order to improve battery life.Don't fetch emailsIf your phone checks for new emails every so often you can turn this off or reduce the frequency of it in order to conserve battery - turning fetch off will mean you have to go onto the emails before it will look for new messages.  Turn off ParallaxThis fun new feature from the update last year does cause your battery to drain more than it needs to, so unless you're totally in love with this feature then turn it off.Don't auto-update appsThis will firstly use a lot of data and will also draw lots of power when updating apps so only do this when you have a WiFi connection and you have a power source nearby.Turn it offIf you are not going to be using your phone for a long time then turning it off would be a great power saver as it will reduce the battery consumption to near zero which is naturally very good. Also turning it off while charging will help to charge it more quickly.Recharge ONLY when neededAvoid putting the phone on charge while it still has a fair amount of battery remaining, doing this actually reduces the amount of charge it is able to hold so allowing the battery to get down to a lower percentage (>10-20%) would be better before you connect it to power.You can always check what is using the most battery if you go to Settings -> General -> Usage -> Battery Usage and then you can think about using that feature less or getting rid of it completely.One thing to keep in mind is that the most power consuming thing is having the screen on, so having it off as soon as you stop using it and not checking it every 5 seconds will help big time.
How can I reduce the sound of clicking my mouse
For a temporary solution you can simply put a scarf or any other kind of fabric over the mouse or only over the button you want to silence. Then just use it as normal, with the fabric between your fingers and the mouse. I've used this at school, while the teacher was talking and I was playing games and needed to click furiously. Without the scarf the teacher noticed I wasn't paying attention because of all the clicks he heard.For a permanent solution I don't know anything except messing with the micro switches, which has already been posted as an answer.
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
This one doesn't work at a friend's house if your goal is to avoid letting anyone know the thing is clogged. However, it works great if that's not a concern.Turn off the water to the tank. There should be a water inlet behind the toilet with a valve you can close by simply turning the handle until it's tight.Drain the water from the bowl. This might mean waiting for it to drain or, if it's really clogged, scooping out the water on top with something you can either throw away or wash in the dishwasher. The goal is to get the bowl as empty as possible. Yes, this part can be pretty gross.Boil water in your biggest pot. It'll take a while but using a lid really speeds it up.Pour the boiling water into the bowl and wait.Typically, the water will straight-up dissolve whatever hellish mess you've left in there. It certainly works for solid human waste. If you've clogged it with a bunch of paper, though, it won't be quite as effective as the paper hold together much better.

How to keep a desktop computer cooled down
I'd like to point out that @Coomie 's answer has a point worth discussing:Check that you've used (enough) thermal adhesive between the CPU and the heatsink/fan. Stock coolers often come with too much silver paste for thermal adhesive. A german PC magazine had this funny test about alternative thermal adhesives. Although it was done humourously they conducted real tests.The winner was ketchup and if i remember correctly, 3  out of 5 tested substances scored better than silver paste. The test can be found in German language when searching for video "Pc Games in Gefahr Wärmeleitpaste".The upside of silver paste is that it's more stable over time. Besides that it's a mediocre heat conductor and only useful to close the gap between CPU and heatsink. A friend of mine recently advised to do some high precision grinding/polishing (he has access to industrial metal working machines (as opposed to hendheld "tools")) to both the CPU and the cooler, but I can't comment on the results.
How to clip/clamp/clutch/pinch side of faulty old LCD monitor screen?
I don't see any possible hacky solutions to this. I would use a spring clamp like either these:They are large enough to grasp the monitor and (hopefully) not fly off. They are also usually inexpensive (< $2 USD).

You can sometimes pop dents out (if they aren't creased) with a GoPro suction cup, or a particularly strong GPS windshield mount suction cup.
How to clip/clamp/clutch/pinch side of faulty old LCD monitor screen?
An adaption to the binder clips would be to put some adhesive putty on either side of the clip to hold it in place.If you put something like Blue Tac on either side then this will give it more to grip onto and it should keep it in place for your purpose!There are always larger clamps and clips that you could buy in order to replace what you already have but in terms of working with what you have this solution is a goer. A second possible solution which may or may not work is to stretch a few elastic bands over the side of the monitor (keep it on the plastic edges in order to keep screen un-obscured) this would probably work better if you had something underneath the bands in order to make them rise away from the screen and give it more of a pushing force to push the screen together, but again this may or may not work, worth a try though!Thirdly and perhaps the most 'hacky' method would be to improvise your own binder / clip. Get two sturdy bits of wood / metal / plastic, either as a rod or thin block type shape.  Three quarters of the way up the two rods / blocks (hereinafter referred to as 'the rods') place a wedge of paper (at least as thick, if not thicker, as the monitor) and then wrap an alastic band or two around the two rods above the wedge of paper (one loop below in order to keep the wedge in place) and wrap a few times until fairly tight and you can use them sort of like chopsticks.  You can then use them as you would a normal clip and add Blue Tac or something to the ends to make them more sticky if need be! Below is an image of chopsticks which is basically what I am trying to explain:Obviously you'll need to to a bigger scale with a larger wedge in the middle but this is the premise I am aiming for, a couple of them may be better than one on its own.Here is a link to how you can make these chopsticks on YouTube.
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
General Prevention:If you know you have the potential to clog and are out and about,flush before you start to gauge the flushing capacity / force of thetoilet, and if it doesn't 'seem' strong flush as you go. Flush before using Toilet paper.  I have read that in some cultures / locations you simply do not put TP in the toilet and it goes straight to the trash.. something to consider. As a courtesy cover it up?Get a bidet /diaper washing hose installed on your toilet.At home or away:Flush a second time, wait a minute or two. The water pressure inmost cases will address the issue.Use the plunger, as most bathrooms have one.Use something nearby to reduce the solids in the toilet. If you used too much TP sometimes at a friends house you may not have many options. It is gross but use a Q-tip (found in most bathrooms) and remove the excess floating TP and place it in the trash. Your friend rather have a bit of wet TP in their trashAt Home:Keep a long handled flathead screwdriver in the cabinet to either scoop outexcessive toilet paper or just "mix it" up if necessary. It is alsoa lot easier to clean than a toilet brush or plunger afterwards. Alternatively those plastic ripcord snakes for drains can be used to hook TP but not nearly as effective.Once you've removed the toilet paper, water pressure usually takes care of it after a couple of minutes or instantly. If not then plunge, and if slowly draining add extra water to the basin to keep it just short of over flowing.Snake it.. use a small snake.. a big mega-snake is usually not required.As an item of Last resort short of calling a plumber, and assuming you have already '*removed the contents (you can scoop and plunge out the water so there is almost 0 on your side of the clog) of the basin AND shut off the water*' (Both VERY Important).. and you are down to just a clogged pipe internal to the toilet.. use a FLOOR / CURTAIN / CLOTHING STEAMER without the brush / head attachment. Put a towel in the toilet with a small hole for the steamer head to trap the steam, steam it for a couple of minutes, plunge, then repeat. You will smell sewer gas or hear something sometimes when it comes free. This will help break down anything in the internals of the toilet and or unfreeze any DRAIN pipes.  There is some risk of some mess and other damage (so use with caution, you assume liability for doing so) understanding the risks, but I used this on my own drains before and saved some dollars.
How to keep a laptop cooled down
First question: has it always been like this?  If not, did it start abruptly, or develop gradually?  (Gradually means it's probably dust buildup.)One thing that hasn't been addressed is to see what your laptop is actually doing when it overheats.  Install a CPU monitor and check the load.  If you're just doing stuff like text editing & web browsing, you should see only a few percent CPU utilization.  If you're e.g. gaming and running the CPU near 100% for long periods, it will naturally run hotter.  A monitor should also be able to show you actual fan speed &c: if it's heating up and the fan's not turning, there's your problem.You can use a program like PowerTop (on Linux) to discover programs & hardware that aren't really being used, but still suck power (and so create heat).
Prevent mints from rattling in the car
There are various options you can try to achieve to complete the second way (2).Placing the mints in a little bag - instead of carrying them around in a metal container, where they're bound to rattle, you could instead carry them in a little pouch type bag. (Albeit un-stylish, it removes the rattling). Something like below is what I imagined would suitYou could place a piece of cloth/fabric inside - placed inside the container, into the empty space, essentially "filling" the container so much so that the mints don't rattle.Padding the container with foam/cloth - albeit an extreme option, instead of filling the empty space with cloth, you could pad the container on the inside (If it annoyed you to the point of killing someone). Basically, padding the whole inside of the container as marked in this image below. What you want to do is pad anywhere the mints have contact to the inside of the container. Essentially making a nice snug fit and "noise proofing" it.As for your first issue, is the glove compartment empty? Which causes it to easily rattle? Or have you got other stuff inside there and the mints container is on top of that?
What can be used in place of a mousepad?
If your problem is simply just getting the mouse to move freely over the surface either traditional desktop or an improvised mouse pad try this.  Take sticky tape such gaffer tape or otherwise with a backing that wont catch on the table.And put tape over the pads under the mouse that are designed to help the mouse move freely under regular use.  Sounds strange but works for me when I am using the mouse on surface that has little friction.For a portable mouse pad, just tear the PVC cover off a letter/A4 sized notebook. I find they work fantastic and are stiff so wont crumple, and easy to find.

How to stop a trashbin from stinking
Don't put food in the trash. Instead, flush down the toilet or use the disposal. Rinse out cans and containers before throwing in the trash.Wash the bin out periodically. If you leave it sit, it will eventually air out, but it may help to wash out with a hose.I would remove the big trash bag from the external bin. It serves only to prevent the bin from airing out. Do not throw anything into the bin that is not already in a trash bag or grocery bag. A bag in the bin itself is unnecessary.When throwing small bags into the bin, insure they are tied.Make sure to have the bin at the curb on time for weekly pick up.I do not recommend baking soda or similar remedies. Once you stop whatever bad habits regarding the trash bin, putting an agent in the bin will not be necessary. Do things differently starting now and the smell will be gone in a few days.
Prevent mints from rattling in the car
Try placing the container on its a side. That way the mints will stack on top of each other in a smaller space and not rattle. Neither will they be bouncing on a flat sounding board.
How to clean dirt/dust out from under your keyboard keys
For a separate keyboard, invert and shake. The same, but much more gently, for a laptop that is shut down. A cheap paintbrush is great for cleaning between the keys, before the dirt gets underneath. Air pressure is just as likely to drive dirt into the keyboard as out of it.Though you state you want to avoid removing keycaps, some may may be popped off easily using a thin wire hook or nylon thread looped underneath... but some laptops require disassembly to remove them.
How to keep bread fresher for longer
Use the freezer. It works well. I know you said you don't like to do that, but that's what I do.Whenever we buy bread, whatever kind it is, if it has been out a couple of days I put it in the freezer.You don't have to thaw it out before using it. Sandwich goodies or your hands are usually enough to thaw. If not, let it sit a couple of minutes. It thaws very fast. You might microwave for 15-20 seconds, but even that may be too long.I have never experienced sogginess doing it the way I've suggested. Do not apply water to the bread to moisten it.
How to clean dirt/dust out from under your keyboard keys
I've used a product called CyberClean. It's a Swiss product that is kind of like Gack if you have heard of that. It sticks to it's self but not to the keyboard and collects lots of dust in all the weird nooks and crannies that computers have. It works well for dust, crumbs, hair and lots of other small stuff and can wrap around irregular objects. It is not oily and does not leave streaks even on monitors but if you try to force it in too small of a gap pieces may come off. Then you just have to carefully dab at it until the small pieces are collected. You can buy these in small baggies or in little tubs. A small baggie would work for weekly to monthly cleanings of a laptop for 1 year probably. Check it out hereThe Product on Amazon
How to keep bread fresher for longer
It's all about location, location, location!There are a couple of things that will aid  the growth of mold and bacteria and it is best to try and prevent these conditions being met in order to prolong the freshness of the bread. The things that I can think of are:Heat - Don't allow the bread to be in a warm / hot location, room temperature is fine.Light - Try to keep bread in a dark place like in a bread bin or just in a cupboard away from both natural and artificial light.Moisture - Keep the bread away from any moisture and try to prevent moisture getting onto the bread, again this can be done by using a bread bin or a cupboard with only dried goods such as pasta. Also always redo the packaging in order to keep any air and moisture out.So if getting a bread bin is an option then I would suggest that, and suggest that it be kept away from windows to avoid any sunlight heating it up and turning it into a bread sauna. Do not store the bread in a fridge as this will only increase the speed at which it will go stale but it would prevent mold - not really a good compromise but that is down to you.   Refrigerating the bread speed up the crystallization of the starch molecules which is one of the main reasons for bread going stale and this happens much more quickly when just above freezing temperature as opposed to being at room temperature. See here for details. Also Sheldon in Big Bang Theory says it so it must be true.As you've mentioned freezing helps a lot as it stops any mold full stop, you would have to thaw it but this can be done with a microwave in about 10 seconds or a toaster for a little bit longer (I'm not sure on the specific for that one but it isn't too long). You are correct in that the bread is slightly soggy once defrosted but if you are game for a toast sandwich then just leave it in the toaster to crisp up and it will give you a delicious crunchy sandwich!If you fancy a change from white or 50/50 bread - try wholewheat bread, this takes a longer time to develop mold and bacteria (or at least it takes longer for you to notice it) and is also more healthy for you, but keep in mind you should still store the bread in a dark, dry place.
How to keep bread fresher for longer
Don't freeze it!Keep in in a closed plastic bag in a non-freezing compartment of the refrigerator from day one. When waterdroplets appear inside the bag, or when the bread feels too wet and heavy for your taste, leave the bag open for a day or more. This helps because cold air has a low humidity.This treatment will keep your bread edible for at least a week. No more moulding, ever.(I have been doing this for many many years now, with all kinds of bread, and don't even remember what stale or moulded bread looks like. Where these silly stories about cooling being bad come from, I honestly don't know.)
How to keep bread fresher for longer
I keep the bread wrapped in a plastic bag and put it in the fridge (not in the freezer). This way it lasts 2 or 3 days more than if it stays in room temperature. If you don't need it to be soft you can put it for some time in a toaster. It will become more dry and this will prevent mold development for another 2 days or even more.
How to keep bread fresher for longer
I don't eat much bread, but I always buy a large sliced loaf, and I do freeze it, usually splitting the bag and freezing half, double wrapped in plastic bags, keeping the other half in the fridge. Its surprising how quickly bread defrosts - if you only want a couple of slices, its possible to crack off a couple from a frozen loaf, pop them in a bag and they'll be defrosted within 5 minutes at room temperature, and they're not soggy either. If I want more, I just take out the half I've frozen and let it defrost naturally, probably takes about half an hour, and again, it's not soggy. Which means you don't actually have to leave it out all night, you can just take out what you need in the morning if you want a sandwich to take to work, for instance. Obviously, if you want toast, you can put it straight in the toaster from frozen anyway.I freeze it because I hate sandwiches made with bread that's more than two days old, by which time it's lost that nice softness.
How to remove residue from coins corroding
Vinegar is well-known to remove rust and corrosion from materials, and it's completely safe for you and the counter.Liberally apply white vinegar to the area, let it soak for about an hour, and scrub it with a toothbrush. Abrasive sponges (as seen below) work very well.
How to cut open a pita bread?
It does help if you heat them - this tends to make them puff up a bit, but even then you need a sharp knife to insert along a leading edge and then slice along, and the knife does need to be sharp and preferably serrated. I heat them in the wide slot toaster, that seems the most effective (rather than putting the oven on), they tend to go soggy in the microwave; I don't leave them long enough to actually toast them either. I find some form a 'pocket' quite nicely, and some don't, so out of a pack of, say, 6 standard supermarket own brand, half might open nicely and the other half just don't. I have to say, though, the pitta bread pictured looks quite different from the standard ones I usually buy, it seems thicker both sides with a good pocket of air in between, so maybe some brands are better than others.
How to keep a laptop cooled down
In addition to the recommendations to vacuum out the vents, you may also want to make a note that the vents on a laptop for intake might actually be on the bottom - while the vent holes on the bottom of the laptop might be being obscured by the table/book/clipboard/your legs, that will also increase the temperature in your laptop.I own a Multimedia grade laptop that gets hot when the vents are obscured, and actually, it gets hot just running the OS I use (I don't use Windows, and it's not an Apple product) - I run sensor applets to report me the sensors temps, but I always catch it before shutoff. A portable cooling pad could help, with two fans, and the ability to use that as the surface even on your legs and such (~$20-$45 US).  The closest to what I use is this model by Targus sold on NewEgg, but there are a lot of similar models that also work.  (Ones that have their own internal power by battery to control the fans, ones that connect to USB, etc.)
Hacking a proximity card (Oyster card) for legal use
According to Engadget it should be able to work, as the Oyster cards seem to operate by NFC. The article also mentions the ability to use other kinds of cards and other NFC tag based trinkets (NFC sticker, NFC wristband). However, these are all issued by financial institutions, so they would reasonably contain some kind of encryption that might be hard to integrate with off the shelf NFC tags.If I were you I'd try scanning an Oyster card using an NFC reader application, like this one. If you find that the card returns a fixed value for each reading, then go ahead and try to program this value into a custom NFC tag, essentially copying the card. If this new "card" can be used with the official Oyster readers then you are all set. However, it probably won't work, but there is still hope (see next paragraph).This video suggests that the Oyster cards use some kind of security chip (Mifare Classic Smartcard Chip). This is reinforced by Wikipedia too. It seems to be possible to buy this kind of chip from this website.

Or take half a lemon, dip the cut side into table salt, and rub at the marks with that. Should work on the porcelain, though you may have to repeat it, not sure about the metal tap.
How to remove residue from coins corroding
Barkeepers friend, an oxalic acid based cleaner is stronger than those solutions, and should work if they don't remove it entirely. 
Hacking a proximity card (Oyster card) for legal use
A well-designed contactless card performs cryptography using a secret key when you access information. An NFC reader information only returns public information, not the information that the fare gates verify. A badly-designed card returns a fixed value; these are common in building access but not so much in transportation. In between, you have low-end Mifare cards which use encryption but with algorithms that can be broken.So the upshot is that it depends on the precise model of transportation card.In any case, if your transportation authority doesn't offer a way to replicate the card information, then even if you manage to transfer the information to a phone or to an implant, that won't make your phone or implant a valid fare medium and you would likely face fines if inspected.
How can I better clean headphones that sit inside the ear?
You can use isopropyl alcohol (known as rubbing alcohol) or the sprays for cleaning LCD diplays. Put very small amount of this liquid on a cotton pad (usually used for medical or cosmetic purposes). Lay the cotton pad on flat surface and rub the opening of the headphones against it. I think you should hold the headphones over the cotton piece, because if they are under it some alcohol mey leak when pressing the cotton and can go inside the earphones. Instead of cotton pad you can use a towel the same way.
How to quickly remove a splinter
Usually the fastest ways to remove a splinter hurt more and the slower ways hurt less. If speed is the top priority, then I have a few good methods. Use tapeWrap a piece of Scotch tape (can be other kinds, too) gently around your finger. Now pull the tape off and it should come off. This method might not work on the first try. It also might be more painful than other methods.TweezersWorks best if you can see the splinterSterilize the tip of the tweezers with rubbing alcohol (optional). Grab the splinter, but don't squeeze too hard. Now pull the splinter out at the same angle it went in.GlueThis is a slow method and probably won't work within 30 minutes, but it is painless. Simply, pour glue on the splinter, let it dry, and pull it off. The speed of this all depends on how quickly you can get the glue to dry.Source: WikiHow
How to quickly remove a splinter
Tweezers is always good, but sometimes they can be difficult to grab the splinter if it is small. At work we have splinter removers, and it is a flat piece of metal with a very sharp point on one tip. You can use a needle the same way. You put the sharp part under the splinter and above the skin, angle the sharp point into the splinter and then pull out the splinter. A needle doesn't work as well because the point is not as sharp, but it still works, and either one may need a few tries. 
How to quickly remove a splinter
Needles are good. The point can be used to pull or scrape away skin until the splinter is finally exposed. Once enough of the splinter is exposed, the needle tip may stick and slide it out or flick it away. Apply alcohol to the site after digging a splinter out.Toenail clippers are what I usually use; the type that look like small wire cutters. Tweezers are not sharp enough to penetrate the skin and grab, mashing down, instead. The clippers can gently cut away skin until the splinter is exposed then easily grab it. Sometimes only the point of one of the blades can be used to flick it away.
How to cut open a pita bread?
There are a few options to do this, without breaking the pita bread.Heating up the bread in the microwave tends to warm it up and make it easier to cut because it puffs up more than before.Grilling each side in a frying pan for a few seconds - this warms the pita up and also makes the outsides crispy while the inside stays soft and warm, allowing you to cut it easily since the outside is essentially "encapsulating" the rest of the pita, preventing it from breaking.Purchase pita pockets instead of pita bread - this is the last resort option as the pockets will come pre-cut and ready for use.
How to quickly remove a splinter
General considerationsGeneral measures for successfully removing splinters are:Take it easy - in a hectic rush the splinter may break and will then be much harder to remove.Do not put pressure on it as it only will push it deeper into your skin,  or even it may break.Try to find out what material the splinter is.  In case the splinter is not easily accessible (foot, right hand in case you're right-handed) get help from another person.  Seek a doctor if the skin around a splinter shows inflammation.  Always seek a doctor in case you can't remember your last tetanus shot. PainDon't worry much about pain. It will only hurt when you push the splinter (which you shouldn't do) but only little if at all when you pull it. As soon as the splinter was removed the pain will stop immediately. If pain persists or gets worse you may have a broken splinter remnant in your skin. In case it also swells or the skin gets red you will have an infection which should be treated. See a doctor then.Case wooden splinter or metal splinter sticking outIn the usual case where you can see the splinter base still sticking our of the skin, you may grab it and remove it gently, taking care it does not break. Use any tool you find to securely hold it while pulling it along its entry angle. Consider disinfecting (e.g with alcohol or a lighter flame).Special splinter tweezers (in my experience a "Feilchenfeld" design forceps is best)Eyebrow hair tweezers are great too.Fine tweezers from your toolbox may work in case its tip is not deformed.In case the splinter does not come out very easily: do not pull harder - it may break. Put your skin in warm soapy water.Wooden or metal splinter not sticking out or brokenIn this case, we still may be able to grab it by making the opening it entered the skin a bit wider. In this case, we must disinfect our tools. Softening the skin by holding it for 10 minutes in warm soapy water considerably helps.Use two tweezers, one to widen the hole in your skin, a second one to grab the splinter.  Use a sharp needle or blade to go underneath the splinter and lift it a bit. Then grab it with a tweezer.Cactus spine or plant thornThese "splinters" are much harder to remove as they may break very easily, or they may have barbed spines designed by nature to not come out.To remove these we always have to soften the skin by immersing in soap water before we start pulling with methods above.Many small superficial spines or thorns may be removed using tape and pulling them out.Glass splintersGlass splinters are tricky as glass breaks very (very!) easily on grabbing. Once it was broken it will produce many tiny glass fragments that then may be so hard to remove to require surgery.Therefore removing a glass splinter may better be done by a professional.In case we try  by ourselves we need to be very careful to not hold it too firm and to prevent it from breaking.
Any tricks for treating a blister so I can go running without it reappearing?
Nothing resembling a life hack is the answer; its usual to cover the blister with a plaster or dressing, and in particular, a dressing/plaster specifically made for blisters (Compeed in the UK). Plenty of things to do for prevention, but not for once it's happened, well, not that works well anyway. You can try jamming a tissue or some piece of material inside your sock over the area, but in my experience, it still moves and aggravates the blister even more.
Make coffee with no coffee filters?
I tried to create a similar filter device with a paper towel and it worked perfectly.Here is what I did:First, make sure you have paper towels... seems foolish to mention, but hey... its true!Approximate the size of your basket with your hand and tear a circle out of the paper towel bout an inch (+/- 2cm) wider than the basket size.Place the paper into the basket and push the center down to touch the bottom.the "buckled" edged should then be folded into an accordion (similar to the shape of a normal filter) -- this will help to maintain a "wall" for the water and grounds so they do not overflow into the drink.Place the coffee grounds into the basket in a normal fashion and brew.No further work is needed. The strength of the coffee may vary a bit from what you are used to due to the thickness of the paper towel, but some coffee at 6am is better than NO coffee!
Make coffee with no coffee filters?
As well as paper towels as Phlume has mentioned, there are also a couple of other materials that can be used in place of a coffee filter:ClothYou can use a clean handkerchief or cut a square of cloth from a clean tea-towel and push down into your filter basket - cut away any excess and place the grounds into the 'filter' and continue as you were.Sock or similarIf cloth or paper isn't to your liking then you can use a clean sock, stocking or pair of tights. Just cut down to around the ankle and push into the filter basket as mentioned before. Once again, place grounds in and continue as normal.(Be careful with nylon tights / stockings as the hot water from the machine may cause them to melt which would be less than ideal!)

Make coffee with no coffee filters?
Not much help if you've discarded the previously used ones, but you can actually rinse out paper coffee filters, dry and re-use them. Some coffee presses (eg. Aeropress) put the filter under some stress compared to a drip coffee maker yet they seem to survive fine for a few shots. You can discard the grounds down the drain, and that's a perfect opportunity to rinse the filter under cold water (rub it a bit to make it less coffee colored) then hang to dry. 
How to stop snow from sticking to the shovel
A great hack for this problem is to use non-stick cooking spray. This will do exactly what it does with pans, it will make the snow not stick. You just have to spray a generous amount of the spray on each side of the shovel. This works for both plastic and metal shovels. It might even work with shovels on the beach during the summer, so they don't get sand on them (not sure, haven't tried it). Extra Hack: Apply cooking spray to the bottom of a sled to make it go faster.
How to remove screws with stripped heads?
I know this is very late, but I know a great hack for this. All you need a matchstick. All you have to do is use the square bottom of the matchstick and put it in the screw. Now, you can get the screw out by using the match like a normal screwdriver.

Take off your sock and stretch it over the bin like a filter, fill with coffee, enjoy.  Might sound gross, but I challenge anyone here to a blind taste test between sock coffee and Folgers. 
How to stop snow from sticking to the shovel
Don't use a shovel. There was a guy who made a video of himself rolling snow up like a carpet. Depending on the depth of your snow, this may not work for you.
How to stop snow from sticking to the shovel
Look at how other people have solved the problem of making snow slide off. Or rather, of making themselves slide off of snow. Meaning, wax that snow shovel like a pair of skis or a snowboard.You can get serious and do it with actual ski wax, but auto detail wax would help as well. Even a quick Turtle Waxing will help.
How to stop snow from sticking to the shovel
If you use a different type of shovel, more like a plow, and push it like a plow, there is never an issue of snow sticking. Hold at a slight angle while going down the driveway just like a big snowplow. If more snow, make narrower swaths. The plow type shovel still allows you to throw when needed.Use this:instead of this:
Prevent mints from rattling in the car
You can try to do what Darren did with one variation: Put it in a sock. The sock is pretty soft and should effectively muffle the banging sound. The sound is created since the container and mints have a large space to bounce and bang into. If you limit the space the mint box has to bounce and bang in, there will be little or no sound.You can effectively do this by:Putting it in your cup holderPutting it in a bag filled with stuff like clothes or lots of paperworkYou pants' pocketA small side pocket in any type of bag similar to this one:A backpack or luggage bagThis should significantly lower or eliminate the sound from the metal box and mints. I hope this helps you!
Removing Pepper Juice From Eyes
For quick pain alleviation, put a cold, wet rag on the eye. This won't last, but what will is washing your eye out with milk. Get about a fluid ounce of milk (if you have a shot glass, fill that up). Whole milk works best, but 1% and 2% should also work. You can flush out your eyes with this milk. Rest the cup of milk on the bone at the base of you eye. Pour it on your eye and try to keep your eye open (hold it open if you can). This will be a bit messy, but it is worth it. If you don't feel comfortable washing your eye out in the shower. It won't be as effective, but it still works.Next time, right after you are done cutting the peppers (or whatever else you do with them) wash your hands with olive oil. Olive oil will wash up the part of the pepper juice that makes it burn.
Make coffee with no coffee filters?
Make Polish style coffee ("Mud Coffee" according to Wikipedia).  Put one cup's worth of coffee grounds in the bottom of a coffee cup.  Pour in boiling water.  Stir the coffee grounds a bit and let them settle.  Once the grounds settle, after a minute or two, the coffee should be drinkable without being gritty until you get to the bottom of the cup.  If you drink milk in your coffee, it should be added after the grounds start to settle.EDIT: This is a solution for a lack of a filter, but it is not a solution for the OP.  This coffee should not be stirred after the grounds have settled (aside from adding milk/sugar) as that will make it gritty.  
How to get rid of frozen snow
If there is ice on the driveway, shovel off what you can on top. Allow the shovel to slide over the ice. Get a heavy duty scraper like one in the middle in the picture below. With a good scraper the ice comes right off. Some work is involved, but not too bad. Put salt down on any remaining ice. You should have a good scraper on hand, anyway, so the expense is justified. Without the proper tool, ice is very hard to remove.Salt does not work if it's too cold. Salt should only be applied to remaining ice once the majority has been removed.
How to get rid of frozen snow
You can use common household salt which you are more likely to need again but instead of trying to cover the whole area run it in a grid about a shovel width wide/high - give it some time to work then use your shovel/spade to break along the lines and remove the chunks to the side/lawn.Note: As an aside it seems that Clifton Suspension Bridge would be damaged if road salt was used as a de-icer so crystalised horse urea, (look it up if you don't know what that is), is used in cold weather. Don't stand under it with your mouth hanging open.
Removing Pepper Juice From Eyes
Remove, pepper juice no.  Deactivate pepper juice effects, yes!A method that I've personally seen work in an extreme case is :Mash bananas and rub onto affected areas - typically eyes and area around them.Apparently ripe bananas work better Q: Does it work?    A: Oh yes!This was used on the advice of friends from India.It worked - story below.Around the web:Many sites suggest that washing in milk worksA number of sites say that Aloe Vera in a number of forms works well.Some say that water works - and many say that it doesn'tI have seen banana work miracles - see below. The Banana Experience:Long ago my then-young son decided to play with peppers in a dish. We told him to leave them alone and that it was dangerous but he persisted.He was well coated with the juices around and in his eyes before he or we realised.His skin rapidly reddened in patches and he was in extreme pain.Crying and yelling accompanied by everything logical we could think of were minimally effective. He was a very unhappy chappie. We rang friends who had spent several decades in India."Bananas" they said. "Ripe ones are best. Squash & apply".We had none. I headed rapidly for the nearest fruit shop.Back with bananas maybe 10 minutes later I was confronted by the still screaming, crying red-faced victim.  Peel/squash/splat. Done!Just like that. Instant fix.Whether he was especially sensitive to the banana remedy and whether it would work as well for others, or for all pepper types I know not. But as the advice was based on extensive Indian experience it may indeed be relatively universal.Related:As a well read child I'd heard that the antidote for Stinging-Nettle burn was to rub Dock leaves onto the affected areas. I live in NZ. We have stinging nettles which are usually far worse than the UK/European variety but they are usually only found in remote areas. Dogs and a few people have been killed by them, but its rare. I once got badly burnt by them, but that's another story.My wife and I visited Britain and continental Europe in 2003. I and my camera tend to clamber and wander off the beaten path. In England I found that a shortcut off the path in Sherwood Forest took me through groves of knee deep stinging nettles. At Tunbridge castle I tried to walk the olde wall from the Mott to the Bailey. Agh - more nettles (maybe deliberately placed?). In Flanders Fields very few poppies grew. I jumped an irrigation ditch to get closer to some I saw. I landed on all fours in a patch of guess what! And more.On ALL such occasions in Europe, Docks did indeed grow immediately adjacent and squashing their leaves and rubbing onto the affected areas helped greatly (if not a perfect fix).Bananas may, just maybe,  have worked as well but banana palms are at a substantial premium in the European countryside. FWIW "Stingoes" spray on anti sting "custom medicine" works VERY well for REAL NZ Sting Nettles. Without it I may have needed to be hospitalised. Interestingly, it claims to be nothing except Aluminium Sulphate. 
Plucking a chicken without a machine
I grew up on a chicken farm, so I know this. We had a boiler with wax. You melt lots of wax, dunk the chicken in it, then in cold water, repeat a few times till it's thick enough, then crack it open and voila! the feathers come off. Then you melt the feathery wax in another pot, sieve it and put it back in. Makes an immense mess, and is quite slow, but it does get all the feathers off in one go.(We children loved it, we dared ourselves to make casts of our hands.)
How to get rid of frozen snow
There are a couple of things that you might have in your household that could replace normal road salt.Table saltYou can use normal table salt and apply to afflicted areas, a table spoon or two per square meter should be enough to melt the ice.Dishwasher saltIf you happen to have a dishwasher and subsequently dishwater salt, this will also work as well if not better than normal salt - apply in the same way mentioned above. (Be careful not to apply onto plants or flowers as this could kill them and harm any animals that use them as food)Sand and/or ashIf you happen to have some sand or ash lying around the house you can use this to spread over the areas - while it won't have the same de-icing properties present in salt, it will offer grip underfoot to prevent slipping. It will still help to melt the snow, just not quite as well. (You could also use bird seed to provide the grip if that is what you are looking for)Sugar Beet JuiceYou can spread some beet juice over the ice as it has a lower freezing point than water so will help to turn the ice back into a liquid - perhaps not the best idea if the temperature where you are is considerable sub-zero (I don't know the exact freezing point for the juice).VinegarIf you mix equal amounts of water and vinegar, you can make a natural de-icer, if the ice is particularly thick, add a tad more vinegar to your solution for a great de-icing effect. Vodka - thanks to @fluffySimilarly to the beet juice trick, vodka also has a lower freezing point than water so would be able to melt the ice if you are willing to pour some valuable alcohol over the afflicted areas.Finally, and perhaps not advisable, you could try just leaving you car running - highly inefficient, wasting fuel and polluting the air but the fumes from the exhaust would melt any snow underneath this point and eventually the rest of the vehicle would heat up and this heat would radiate melting ice in the immediate vicinity. Again - highly inadvisable due to the fact it could also be dangerous to your health but thought I would add this as a possible option in case the rest are of no use to you.I hope one of these are of some use to you, if all else fails just heat up loads of blankets and cover the iced area with them - would take pretty much forever to be effective but could be fun and worth a shot, take them straight from a tumble dryer and there you have it, a hot blanket.
How do I remove gum from my beard?
Vegetable / Olive oilIt's easily available, and perfectly safe to use (although a bit hard to clean up).I recently went to sleep while chewing a gum, and woke up in the morning with my head "stuck" to the pillow. I had an almost bottle-cap sized patch of hair tangled up in the gum.After pondering the internet for advice, I ended up using vegetable (cooking) oil, although the Olive oil is recommended. I soaked the exposed area with an old toothbrush for 5-10 minutes, and then just combed the gum out and washed the hair a few times with the shampoo (the oil is really hard to get out).It's messy, and your skin will hurt for a bit near the hair roots, but you will be gum-free. And it beats the solvents by a long shot.
What is the perfect microwaving time for my food?
Well like you says it completely depends on how much food is there and the density of said food. I find that if you have rice or something that can be moved around easily - making a 'well' in the middle of the container and spreading the rest evenly will help giving you an even heat over all of the food.Placing the container in the middle helps greatly as well as this is where most of the microwaves will 'hit' so it'll warm up quickest here.I found out the other night after trying to heat up an indian takeaway with rice, meat, sauce, saag aloo all on the same plate - some of it took no time at all (rice) but the meat and sauce took ages ( >5 minutes) and to be honest I have no idea why, so I would imagine mixing everything together would also aid in getting an even heat across the food.There is no real rule in guessing how much time something will take, not that I am aware of anyway, but I tend to go for 3-4 minutes for anything not bread-like and then stab a fork in and touch to the tip of my tongue. If I come away thinking, I shouldn't have done that... It's normally done, if not - stick it in for another minute or so. (when I say non bread-like I mean like not bread or something quite light in terms of density as these things take like 10-20 seconds)Hope some of this helps in some way.
How can I improvise a magnifying glass?
If you have a smooth, cylindrical drinking glass made of clear glass, you could fill it with water and allow the convex shape of the glass to magnify the object behind it.Alternately, if you have a clear plastic 2 liter bottle, you can cut off the top part that is rounded, and fill it with water and look down through the water. (Science-sparks.com)
What is the perfect microwaving time for my food?
Does the position of the food in my container affect microwaving-time?Yes.  If you can shape your food into a torus (think donut) it will heat more evenly and you won't have to mix it up and put it back in.There are some suggestions at wonderhowto for improving on this 'hole in the middle' such as placing larger items on the outside and smaller on the inside, and flattening out the food to provide more surface area; obviously if you're heating in a container this last one isn't really relevant.
How to keep gloves from getting sweaty?
Putting on a snug fitting pair of latex or nitrate gloves on first and then putting the winter gloves on is a good solution. You often see nurses or mechanics wearing these types of gloves to keep their hands free of blood or oil.  The are not effective for keeping your hands warm, but they are effective as a moisture barrier.  When your hands sweat these gloves keep the moisture inside of the latex/nitrate glove barrier and keep your warm winter gloves dry. You can come back in from an hour of shoveling snow, pull off your still dry winter gloves, than pull off the latex/nitrate gloves and through them away.  Your gloves stay dry and your hands stay warm. 
How to keep gloves from getting sweaty?
Go with a moisture-wicking pair of liners - they will keep your hands dry and warm while channeling the moisture away.  When you get in, turn the outer-layer gloves inside out to dry.
How to quickly peel a bag of potatoes
The Super PeelerWarning: only do this outsideThis method takes some time to prepare, but you only have to prepare it once and every other time you do it, it will be ready. You need a bucket, a hose, a drill, and a new toilet bowl brush. Drill a hole in the bottom of the brush's handle and keep the drill there. Spin the brush a few times to make sure it sticks. Fill the bucket with the potatoes. Now put the brush attached to the drill in the bucket, between the potatoes. Start filling the bucket with water, while you spin the brush using the drill. In about 60 seconds, all of the potatoes will be peeled.Image from ThriftyFun
How can I improvise a magnifying glass?
If the reason you are having trouble reading the small type is because you are farsighted/nearsighted, or because it is dark (causing your pupils to dilate and your vision to get fuzzier) you may find it useful to use a pinhole lens.Make a pinhole in a piece of paper or some other thin object, using a pin, safety pin, or the tip of a knife, and then hold it close to your eye and look through it. The image as viewed through the pinhole will not be magnified, but it will be in focus. The smaller and more regular the pinhole is, the sharper the focus will be (and the darker the image will be, due to less light getting through).I put a pinhole in one of my credit cards, and sometimes use it to view restaurant menus which I would be unable to read otherwise without glasses due to my farsightedness and the dim light that typically happens in restaurants.Another thing you can use if necessary is a thumb and two opposite fingers held together to create a tiny triangular hole where they all meet.
How to keep gloves from getting sweaty?
I have several pairs of gloves with different thicknesses and styles. They're cheap! Lowes, Ace Hardware, and many stores have an endless variety. I wear the type gloves suited to the temperature and task. The pair I normally use for shoveling snow are thin, elastic, and have rubber pads on the palms.I prefer my hands to be a little cold, but not uncomfortable. As I work they stay plenty warm. If my hands did begin to sweat I would take the gloves off or go inside and get a lighter pair.

How do I keep my bed sheets organized?
I use one of each sheet sets' pillow cases as a container for the other parts of each set.  Fold the flat and fitted sheet in the normal way, and place them into the pillow case. If there is a second pillow case, fold it up and put it into the storage case as well.  In that way, your sheet set stays organized and fits onto whatever storage shelf you use in a neat little bundle.
How do I put protective screens on, without getting air bubbles?
As you put it on, "wipe" back and forth with a soft, blunt instrument to push out air bubbles before they get trapped in.  A wooden chopstick can work pretty well.Another possibility, however, is to eschew screen protectors entirely - modern device displays are glass, which doesn't scratch very easily at all (being anywhere from 5.5 to 7 on Moh's hardness scale depending on the particular formation), so unless you frequently have your iPad rattling around in a bag with diamonds and corundum you probably aren't actually at any risk of damaging your screen.  In any case, anything that can scratch glass would easily rend whatever protector is on top of it, and would then scratch the glass anyway.Obviously this doesn't apply to older devices with resistive, plastic screens, but screen protectors were invented for that day and age and are basically obsolete today (despite the protectors' manufacturers' marketing otherwise) and also generally make modern capacitive screens harder to use and far less responsive.

How do I keep my bed sheets organized?
I know this may come across a somewhat trivial response... But have you tried folding them up before putting them away?I like to make sort of towers with my sheets in order to keep them all together - so have the duvet cover on the bottom as it is the biggest, then the bed sheet, followed by the pillow cases.An issue might be that the bed sheet is the hardest to fold if it is a fitted one so below is an image of how you can fold it up neatly to go in with your piles.If you keep them all folded and organised in the cupboard then you shouldn't have a problem with them causing a mess. You could always find a couple of old boxes to pop them in or a carrier bag or something similar to avoid them inadvertently falling apart from each other.
How can I quickly eliminate the smell of cigarette smoke in a confined space?
Coffee beans help, though I can't say exactly how fast. I used them before for removing (smoke) smell in used furniture. Just put some coffee beans in a bowl, and let them sit in the room with the smell.
Fastest way to boil water?
Electric kettle has already been mentioned, this works very well for me. A gas stove is a lot quicker than an electrical stove, at least in my experience. Personally, I wouldn't build my house with a gas stove just for quicker hot chocoloate, though. ;-)
Fastest way to boil water?
I live in New Zealand and I have yet to meet someone here who doesn't have an electric kettle on their kitchen bench. Our one gets used several times every day.
Mixing coffee without a spoon
If you don't want to pull anything in the cup, there still is a (very simple) way.Not very effective but it works.Just stand upward, hold the cup in front of you and turn in your own axies. The liquid in the cup will turn counterwise while the cup will not. The "mixing-force" is very weak in this, so sugar which has not dissolved completely ain't affected by this very well. But if you can wait a view minutes after inserting sugar, or if you only use milk, it works well.
Improvised air thermometer
There's a pretty simple way to build your own thermometer with household items. Though it can only show temperature changes. If you really want to know how much degrees the temperature changes you'll need to calibrate your self-made thermometer with a real thermometer.Simple explanation:refHere's a video in case you prefer explanations with an exampleWhat You Need:WaterRubbing alcohol11-ounce clear, narrow-necked plastic bottleRed food coloringClear plastic drinking strawModeling clayStore bought thermometer (optional)What You Do:Add equal parts tap water and rubbing alcohol to the bottle, filling it about a quarter of the way up.Add a couple drops of red food coloring and mix by shaking the bottle.Put the straw in the bottle, making sure it doesn't touch the bottom.Use the modeling clay to seal the straw in place. Leave a portion of the straw sticking out from the bottle, making sure the clay forms a tight seal around the straw and over the bottle mouth, but don't close off the straw's opening.To test if the homemade thermometer works, have your child place his hands around the bottle and observe what happens to the mixture.If made as explained above, you will only see temperature rises. To also see falls in temperature you need to add a few drops of your red mixture to the straw.On wikihow there also are some useful tips:add a drop of cooking oil to the straw. It will prevent the solution from evaporating and provides a clear line to observe changes.to actually measure temperature changes in degrees you need to add a scaleAdd solution to the straw until the level is above the clay (provided your thermometer doesn't look like on the picture above and the straw is actually longer than your bottle (see this image from wikihow)Fix a piece of paper to the straw using clear tapeuse a commercial thermometer to measure the current air temperature, mark this temperature on your just added piece of paperrepeat this process with different temperaturesAs far as I read through the instructions on the linked sites, this isn't intended for air measuring. I guess, if you don't want to measure small temperature changes this will work for air measurement as well.
Improvised air thermometer
You can improvise a thermometer with 4 simple ingredients that can be found in most households:Water BottleDrinking Straw (clear)Food ColouringModelling Clay / mold-able adhesive (blue tac)Now what you can do is put a few drops of food colouring into your water bottle and fill it up to the top with lukewarm water.  Then insert your clear (non-bendy) drinking straw a couple of inches into the top of the bottle and then mold your clay / putty (play-dough would work) around the straw and the top of the bottle until you have an air tight sort of lid with a straw coming out of it. (Be careful not to squash your straw as it needs to be free to pass liquid)Use a marker to mark on the level of the water in the straw (assuming room temperature). You can then put it in a bowl of hot water and the water in the straw should rise and you can now mark on this temperature.Similarly with some ice-water, the level of water in the straw should decrease and you can mark this on the straw too - the fact you have no thermometer makes it hard to know exactly what temperature these markings are at but you can know if it is 'ice-water' cold or 'boiling water' hot.If you set this wherever you need it, you'll have a rough idea of what the temperature is in the room.Note that water isn't that quick to respond to temperature changes so you can make it a 50/50 solution of rubbing alcohol and water and this should give a slightly quicker response.This link gives and explanation as to how it all works if you are interested!
Prevent mints from rattling in the car
to prevent the box from rattling, you could 'stabilize' the box by using adhesive velcro on the back of the box and its assigned spot in the glove box. as far as rattling inside you could try: a "food safe" sealant or coating.  try copy-flex liquid mold making silicone. http://www.makeyourownmolds.com/copy-flexadhesive felt sheets like the ones used to line jewelry boxes - found at any craft storeor use food safe epoxy to attach your choice of foam. check out thefoamfactory.comyou could line it in leather or any choice of fabric (wool, cotton, synthetic) too. the trick is finding a food safe adhesive.
How do I remove gum from my beard?
Hold a compressed air can upside down and spray the gum (pointing away from yourself of course). This will freeze it solid and should be easily broken and combed out then.
How can I quickly eliminate the smell of cigarette smoke in a confined space?
most of these answers assume that someone else is doing the smoking. in that case assertiveness will serve you better than covering the smell.  that said, this seems like a teenager classic question...How do i hide the fact that I'm smoking in my parents' car or in my room.  *wink *wink.  Answer: stuff dryer sheets in a paper towel tube and exhale through the tube.
How to get rid of frozen snow
In addition to the other answers:My suggestion is a mix of large grain (Kosher) salt with sand and small rocks and pebbles works well. Don't go over board on the salt, a ice cream bucket (1 gal) of small pebbles or sand would have about half to a whole box of kosher salt in it if I recall correctly. (I buy it in larger quantities and mix it in larger buckets).General tips are to distribute widely but also establish concentrated areas in lower light areas to create a path of least resistance. So when melt does occur it will find its natural path and the water melt from areas will flow towards it and will assist with other melt and reduce the overall freeze thaw cycle. Using this technique also assist greatly in chipping / scrapping efforts as if you scrap out from the paths you establish with your shovel or ice chipper or even garden hoe. A couple minutes over a couple days usually does the trick under the right conditions, nature takes care of the rest.
What is the perfect microwaving time for my food?
Not completely solving the problem, but if your container is small enough, place a glass of water with the container in the microwave. The glass will stop the food from becoming soggy because the water takes in all the moisture coming from the microwave (moisture also can cause loss of heat) in the process of such, makes it warmer. 
Fastest way to boil water?
For a given amount of water, you can do two things (both at the same time if you care to). We can assume you always have your heat source turned up to maximum.Divide your given amount of water into multiple containers and put each container on its own burner or heater.Time to boil is going to be proportional to the volume of material you are heating. If you put half of your water on one burner and the other half on another burner, each will come to a boil in half the time it would if it were all in one pot on the same burner. (All things being equal - same burner heat output, same pot types,... Note that the container may need some time to heat up, too, but I ignore that here.) Use a bigger container with more surface area. You can see this more readily if you are using a flame (gas stove), but some of the heat escapes around a small container. If you have more surface area to transfer the heat, this becomes more efficient. Switch from a pot to a frying pan, for example.You can even see the importance of surface area efficiency in product purpose built for boiling, like the one from a company called Jetboil:the secret to a fast and friendly design lies in increasing heat transfer efficiencyIn this product, they increase the surface area with what they call the flux ring, and it's demonstrated in their video at the link.But as a hack, just use a bigger pot and/or more burners.
How to quickly peel a bag of potatoes
If you boil the potatoes first, you can peel them by simply rubbing the skin off of them. (And you are not likely to require medical attention with this technique!)It's explained nicely at this link from Creek Line House. They say it takes about two seconds per potato. I've used this method myself. It works. If you can handle the hot potatoes (use a rag or some glove to handle them), you can skip the ice step.
How to remove rust from tools
There are a few good options for thisWhite VinegarThis is slower, but works really well. Soak the tools in white vinegar for about 24 hours. Most of the rust will come off, and the rest will easily come of by scraping it.Baking Soda PasteMix baking soda with water until a paste that you can apply on the tool. Use a toothbrush to scrub off the baking soda. Then rinse with water.DieselSoak the tool in diesel for 24 hours. You can use a brass brush after it is done soaking. Clean it with an old rag after.
How to remove rust from tools
I use WD40. With pliers, spray a good bit then work back and forth until fully loosened up. Rub with a rag with WD40. Makes it like new and will protect.
How to remove rust from tools
Use a wire-brush or if the Surface is sensible use brass-brush.then if is not enoughi use a Product from Hammerite. Is the best i have used yet. It's a Paste. They also have a liquid for immersing the rusted parts. It's a good product becuase it is no rust-inverter, like the most other available products and thats mostly not desired.also it is not too aggressive. the only drawback is the (steel) parts be a little mat. 
Removing Pepper Juice From Eyes
Most kinds of shampoo work well for removing hot pepper juice. You specifically want a shampoo that contains propylene glycol.You are trying to remove capsaicin, an oil that does not dissolve in water and only slightly mixes with regular soap. Water alone will just spread it around and make things worse. Soap will work eventually, but requires many washings and in the meantime will also spread the capsaicin around. Other oils such as vegetable oil will mix with the capsaicin and allow it to more easily be washed away by soap.Propylene glycol, on the other hand, does a pretty good job of dissolving the capsaicin directly, allowing it to be washed away quickly. Many kinds of shampoo have the added bonus of being formulated in such a way that they won't seriously irritate your eyes.
How to quickly peel a bag of potatoes
Leave the skins on, thats where the vitamins and fiber are. People pay stupid amounts of money for potatoes with skins on from processed food manufacturers and we get potatoes from the store and peel the best bit off..!
How can I improvise a magnifying glass?
Here's a really good video describing several different ways to magnify sunlight to start a fire.Don't dismiss this as not helpful though -- it gives more than one way to improvise a magnifying 'apparatus'I'll try and describe with words, but the visual example is linked below.Take a look, sound isn't necessary if you want to mute the video. About 3:30 long:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCyHC7lnMyQGet an old light bulb, the kind with the filament. Break into the bottom of it (the part that spins into the socket) with a screw driver or some such. Be careful to keep the glass intact. After getting the filament out, use a pinch or 2 of salt to clean out the white powder. Swish/swirl it around inside and it'll clean the powder off. Rinse, then refill and you have yourself a curved lens for magnifying.Get a small bowl/candy dish, the inside should be about the size of your fist.  About 2 feet by 2 feet of clear plastic wrap, center the wrap over the bowl, then line the inside of the bowl. Fill the bowl with water about 3/4 full. Then bring the corners of the plastic wrap together, gently lift the water out of the bowl. The water will make the plastic "sag," so carefully twist the top of the plastic so it ends up like a small baggy. Keep twisting until the baggy becomes tight like a ball. Presto! You have yourself a curved lens for magnifying.Less practical, but it'd work. Take a picture frame without the glass or backing or anything, just the frame. Place it on top of two stands, as if the frame was about to become the top of a table and the stands were the legs of that table. Grab that handy plastic wrap and spread it across the frame nice and smooth. Tape the plastic securely to the frame. This would be the clear, plastic wrap, table top. Slowly pour water onto the plastic and it will sag, creating a lens. Put whatever you want to magnify under the table and look through the water to see it magnified.Using a water bottle, with water in it. Near the bottom of the bottle or the top of the bottle, you should be able to angle it just right to get a magnified image.The video uses water and a chemical reaction to create heat, which doesn't address the question at all.-- My own thoughts: A whiskey glass with just the right amount of water in it. Whiskey because the bottom is already in a concave shape, so the water just increases the effect (I'd imagine)A cell phone camera with zoom and a steady hand.Certain flashlights have a magnifying lens in the front to help diffuse/focus the beam of light. You could try taking that off and looking through it.
How to remove grease stains from clothes
My normal course of action to take out a stain is to put dish soap on the stain, then hold the garment with two hands on either side of the stain about an inch or so apart and work the fabric back and forth. Also go in a circular motion against both hands. The stain will become fainter and fainter until gone or unnoticeable.If greasy, work cooking oil into the stain using the method described above, first. The oil will dissolve and loosen grease within the fabric, and the oil can be easily washed out.
How to remove rust from tools
Scrunch up some aluminium cooking foil into a ball and then rub the rusty surfaces. 
Fastest way to boil water?
A pretty fast way to make things hot would be to hover them over open camp fires. I ended up burning marshmallows in a matter of seconds as a kid when I attached them to a tree branch and hovered them over flames.If you can take a pot of water and cover it and stick it in the fire and keep the flames going then you'll get it hot in no time.Only other option would be to use lit torches around the pot, but if you do, PLEASE be careful and use excellent ventilation.

I heard You can clean using coke. http://youtu.be/z7OdX42NjWQEdited/Updated :Have a new bottled coke - which has carbonated gas.Pour coke on the rusted surface.Give it a few minutes, and then take a piece of sponge or a coarse cloth and rub off the rusted surface.NOTE : Only coke which has the carbonated gas works. If it does not have the gas, it does not work.@michaelpri, @subjectivist - Thank you and I will remember to write better answers from the next time. 
What is the best method of cleaning up broken glass?
If you are confident in your eyesight, turn on a light at one end of the room, but make sure there's no light on behind you.The light in front of you will reflect off the glass into your eyes, making it easier to see. With the light behind you turned off, there's no shadow to interfere with seeing the glass.A wet paper towel is the best way to collect the glass. It doesn't need to be dripping, just damp.Then give some space between you and where the glass broke so you don't kneel on a shard. Get down on your hands and knees (with the wet paper towel within reach), move your head near the floor and move back and forth while 'scanning' for glass shards.Then slowly drag the wet part of the towel along the floor where the glass is. It should pick it up, but go in a couple of different directions just to be sure.Just to be sure you got it all, do it again from another angle.Dance!
How do I open a bottle without a bottle opener?
A ring on your finger will work too. It's a little tricky, but I got it to work on my first try.Basically using the ring to grab the metal edges of the cap, and prying them away from the bottle. Get 3-5 prongs to loosen up and then go back to the center prong and put more pressure than before. This time it should (more or less) open right up.Hold the bottle high on the neck, almost as close as you can to the bottle cap.The ring is going to feel like it's cutting into your finger, but it won't actually break any skin.If you have a cheaper quality ring, you'll (eventually) notice a bit of deformation in the ring.I wouldn't do this with a nice ring, it'll likely scratch the ring.Youtube link showing exactly what I'm talking about:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-HSgXflNecLifeHacker Article:http://lifehacker.com/5082121/open-a-beer-bottle-with-a-ringMake a $2 purchase and get a bad-ass Ring Thing Bottle Opener:http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=ring+beer+opener&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=29940260847&hvpos=1s1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18431845672630519405&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_5kqp0i9zkt_b
How to remove grease stains from clothes
When this happens to me, I just use neat detergent (I use liquid detergent in my washing machine) - I stick my finger in some of the washing solution/detergent and apply it to the grease stain direct, rubbing it in a bit, and repeating as often as necessary to cover the stain. Put it through the wash immediately, and the stain disappears. I'd guess this method is more successful with some brands of liquid detergent than others though, so if all else fails, Fairy liquid (dishwashing detergent), applied in the same way, then washed in the usual way in the machine.

First use Sand paper to remove the rust first then clean it with brush using toothpaste. You can also try using kerosene or diesel !! 
Healthiest way to haul over-sized object in an automobile
If carrying long slender items, lay towels or padding on top of the vehicle, lay the items on that, then tie to the front and rear of the vehicle. It's possible to carry items longer than the car this way. To tie, take a thin piece of rope, make a loop in the end, wrap the loop around the item two or three times, slide the rope further up the item, then tie the other end of the rope under the bumper. The rope should bind onto the item and hold it fast. When both the front and rear have been tied the item may flex into a bow shape depending on how rigid it is.I've done 2x4s, 2x6s, 1x, PVC pipe, copper pipe, moulding, and other stuff this way. Long items extending much behind the rear of the vehicle should have a red flag which will be available at the store usually for free.Another way to carry items is to roll down the front passenger window, place the items through the window to the opposite rear corner as far as possible, and leave them extending out the window. Sometimes the passenger seat can be moved or folded down to accommodate. Look at the items and judge whether this will work, first. If extended very far out the window use a red flag and pay attention when driving.Yet another method is to make a simple harness on the passenger side of the vehicle out of rope. To anchor ropes to the car, roll down front and rear windows and tie to seatbelts or whatever available inside. The front and rear doors can also be closed onto the rope to hold it, if the rope is placed toward the top of the door where it is more springy. Do not allow the rope to be pulled through the door since that may damage the rubber or seal. For loads not too heavy this works. Pay attention so items will not scratch paint on the side of the vehicle.
How to store ice cream so that it is easy to scoop
To get softer ice cream, it can't be as cold. It must be just slightly past the point of freezing and no more. You can raise the temperature slightly in the freezer, but that won't do much since freezers are made to freeze. Sometimes there's a cold spot in the refrigerator where stuff freezes. You can lower the temperature in the refrigerator to possibly take advantage of that and store the ice cream there instead.If you eat that much ice cream, consider getting a small freezer just for the ice cream, cheap. Check used appliances for sale.
How to store ice cream so that it is easy to scoop
There seems to be a way to achieve this without having to place the ice cream on the counter to defrost for a few minutes.You can place the ice cream container into a zip lock bag and then place it in the freezer like below:And it should be as soft as the first time you bought it !If that doesn't float your boat, you could cut the ice cream into smaller blocks with a knife.The reason the ice cream goes hard is because: robbing your ice cream of its creaminess.  crystals trapped inside melt. This is fine if you plan to eat your ice cream right away, but when you re-freeze partially-melted ice cream, those ice crystals re-form—but this time they're bigger and crunchier, robbing your ice cream of its creaminess.Source
How to store ice cream so that it is easy to scoop
Dip the scoop in warm water and then scoop the ice cream.For next scoop do the same thing.By doing this the ice cream doesn't stick to scoop. 
How do I apply cold solid spreads (butter/cheese) evenly on breads/sandwiches in a short time?
The breakfast dilemma of trying to spread cold butter straight from the fridge onto toast in the morning has been voted into Britain's top five breakfast annoyances!But wait, Warburtons, the family baker in the UK, has created the Toastie Knife to help with this breakfast dilemma. This prototype called “Toastie Knife” is basically a butter knife with some batteries in the handle that heat up the blade. It's called “the most desired breakfast innovation” by The Daily Mail.Reaching an optimum spreading temperature of 41.8oC in under 30 seconds, the Toastie Knife allows you to spread fridge-cold butter straight onto toast. So you can enjoy spreading the perfect slice of toast. For best results use a good quality bread loaf which is soft enough to guarantee a taste, but strong enough it won't tear when buttered.This is how it works:Here’s a video by Warburtons UK of this cutting-edge technology in action:Using this state of the art technology it can now ensure your optimum butter spread experience!
How to keep a mug on the desk warm?
Pour hot/boiling water in the mug and let the mug warm up, that way the drink won't cool down when you pour it into the cup.You can also use a microwave oven to heat the liquid, but make sure the mug has water in it, an empty mug will not heat and potentially damage your microwave. This will be slightly less effective, since a microwave goes to ~65°C, while boiling water goes to ~100°C.orPut something on top of the mug if you aren't drinking it to keep it warm.Also, thermo cups. Kept my coffee hot for an hour easily.
How to keep a mug on the desk warm?
You have a few options.First, I would recommend getting a thermos, but if you really want to use a mug, there are a  few hacks.Awhile ago, I read this thing about a stick that keeps coffee warm. A good substitute would be to warm something up in the microwave like a spoon or another utensil and then put that in your coffee. It can get very hot, so you can wrap something around the top of the handle like a napkin. I like to wrap thick rubber bands around it.You can also use a heating pad as a coaster. Just heat up the pad in the microwave, then you can put the mug on it to keep it warm.*If you work with a computer at your desk, you might be able to use the heat coming from the computer to warm the mug (doesn't work for all computers)One last thing, you can put a cloth or a towel over the top of the mug when you're not drinking it. Heat rises, so if you can block air from rising out of the top of the mug, then it will stay warmer.* This is my favorite one
How to keep a mug on the desk warm?
Why not to use mug warmer?Keeps a full mug or cup of coffee, tea, soup or any other beverage at the ideal drinking temperature (150-160°F/65-70°C, however it depends on the product). No need to pre-heat, just put your fresh cup of coffee on the black pad and coffee stays the same temp for as long as you like. They're very cheap and convenient.This solves the problem of having to take the cup back to the kitchen to reheat.Few hints:There are versions which you can connect to your laptop via USB, however some of them aren't heating enough, so it's better to use one with a standard wall outlet.Buy one which should have an "auto-off" switch, just like most curling iron have, as a safety feature. Otherwise don't forget to turn it off when you leave house so it won't catch on fire or damage your table underneath.Some of them usually won't keep a full cup hot, but it's does a good job of keeping the hot beverage once you're down to about a half a cup.
How to keep a mug on the desk warm?
I have found the most efficient method is to use a thermos mug, which has a vacuum barrier between the liquid and the environment. More expensive than regular mugs, but my drink is still warm the next day if I leave it overnight.
What is the best winter clothing strategy for keeping warm?
Engineer Toast and the others have provided great suggestions. I have also found that wearing a pair of snow pants (like those used for snowmobiling or skiing) makes a huge difference when you need to be outside for long duration in extreme cold or high winds.

How can I organize Micro SD Cards?
This isn't a hack, really, but a nifty existing product made to solve your problem: a credit-card-sized multi-micro-SD holder.I linked that one kind of at random, but there are other similar products, all under $10. In this version, one side has spaces to write to provide a label for each card. Of course, you have to match them to the slot, but assuming you keep that straight, no problem.(I guess you could also use a basic color-coding scheme and small bits of colored sticker or paint on each card to match.)
How to keep a mug on the desk warm?
Cup socksNow here's not the best solution in terms of heat preservation but it's a hack. What keeps our feet warm in winter can't be too bad for a cup of coffee:Wrapping a thick winter men's sock around a cup is not too hard as long as it is not yet filled.For optimum insulation we can get 2 or 3 layers of warm wool by putting the cup base down into a sock, then fold the sock two or three times, always leaving the top of the cup open.After that we can pour in our hot coffee, which will stay hot much longer than before (also depending on the sock's material of course - thick wool may be best)Of course we can also knit them for a better fit.
How to cover up scratches on wood
There are several options for fixing scratches on woodSmall ScratchesUse a walnut - break open a walnut, so its meat is exposed. Gently rub the walnut back and forth across the scratch. The oil will naturally fill in the scratched areaBlack Tea - put black tea bag in a cup and pour 2 or 3 tablespoons over it. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes; the longer it sits, the darker the color. Dip a cotton swab in the tea, then dab it on the scratchDeep ScratchesGet a wax stick that is the same color as the furniture (you can also blend different colors if you need to)Fill in the scratch until its slightly overfilledScrape off the extra wax on top with a credit card or some other type of cardClean off any excess wax around the now filled-in scratch with a cloth or towel
How do I fill a hot water urn that doesn't fit in the sink?
I've used a flexible cutting board for this, if the faucet is above the lip of the sink. You can curve the flexible cutting board into a "U" shape, put one end under the faucet, and put the other end over the thing you're filling. Turn on the water slowly & carefully to make sure it's running the right direction. And since water will run downhill (isn't that a saying?), your urn or other container will get filled up. :)
How do I stop my cables from getting tangled inside my box?
I've been using this technique for years:Bring the 2 ends of the cable/cord together.Shove the "middle" of the cord (everything but the ends) into a plastic bag that has a zipper (like Zip-Loc brand).  Leave the ends of the cords sticking out.Zip the bag snugly around the 2 ends.It works excellently. You can label the bag too, so you can tell what cord belongs to what. I even made a video about this trick.
How to stop a paperclip slipping off
That does indeed happen just as you describe.  A staple would definitely solve the problem.  A few other options are paper clamps (shown below) or to use envelopes (large manilla) for groupings.  
How to keep a mug on the desk warm?
You can use something to cover the cup. This way it will decrease losses from evaporation. Technically you can do some other thing but I don't know how suitable these are:wrap the cup in aluminium foil to decrease infrared radiation wrap it additionally in some isolation material to reduce heat exchangeThe most simple trick is to add some of the hot beverage after you drink some of the cup. I make tea in a kettle which I leave on the stove and add some to the cup after I drink some of the tea in the cup.

How to hard-boil an egg in the microwave safely?
I've been using the Nordic Ware Microwave Egg Boiler for a few years. Depending on the size of the eggs, you'll need between 6.5 and 8 minutes at 1100 watts. Once you've settled on a brand and size of eggs, you can get them perfect every time - hard boiled, soft yolk etc. by tweaking the cooking time between those two values.Fantastic gadget, 4.5+ stars on Amazon with over 1200 reviews.
Keep the tea bag underwater while microwaving
Soak the tea bag first by running it under cold water from the faucet.Once it's thoroughly waterlogged, it will be heavier than the water it displaces, thus sinking.
How to quickly remove odors from the air?
If you are in a closed room,without windows there is no much to do. Just wait it disappear from the air. If you are in a closed room do not fart on the air,because the only escape to it probably will be a door and if someone get in will be punched right on the face by the smell of your fart.Find a cushion, a pilow or something like that and fart over it. The cushion will absorb your fart and retain the smell.But if you are in room with windows, before you fart, open the windows, stay near it, aiming your butt to the outdoor and fart. Make sure that the wind are not pushing your fart inside the place.These are the actions that I know that you can take when you do not have a deodorant or something like that to use.
How to quickly remove odors from the air?
A simple box of matches - not the ones with red tips (although these are better than nothing), you need the black or brown tipped ones; in the UK, that's ordinary safety matches. Strike one immediately after releasing your flatulence, and no, it doesn't have to be in the region of your backside, you're not trying to ignite anything, just strike it into the air. My bathroom always has a box of matches on a shelf behind the loo... Unlike air fresheners and deodorizers, a struck match removes the smell completely, but it doesn't work with a lighter.Course, everyone will wonder what the hell you're doing if you're in an office or something, so only you can decide whether its worse to claim the dreadful smell as yours, or have everyone suspect its yours, or whether to dispose of the problem before anyone else smells it and explain why you've lit the match. It sounds like you need to keep a pack of matches in your back pocket if its a frequent problem - either that or a change in diet.
How to get rid of carpet indents
Vacuum over themThe simplest and easiest option, but not always effective if the marks are deep.Vacuum over them with a crevice toolThe same suction over a very small space is more likely to pull the carpet fibers back to their original position.Scratch them out with a credit card or similar plastic toolThis is a last resort. Anything that pushes the carpet fibers back up will help.In the future, try to periodically move furniture around (even just an inch or so diagonally) to prevent deeply ingrained marks from forming.
How can I store my Christmas lights so that they don't get tangled?
My answer is similar to TomG's -- put the light string in a Ziploc bag -- but with a few variations.  Let's assume your strand of lights is 10 feet long (a little over 3 meters).Get 3 gallon-sized Ziploc bags. (They're about 27cm x 27cm.)Start at 6 inches (15 cm) from one end of the strand. Put the next 3 feet (or 1 meter) into the bag and zip it closed.  You'll have 2 ends sticking out:  a 6-inch (15 cm) end, and a strand that's 6-1/2 feet (about 2 meters) long.Take the next 3 feet (1 meter) of the 6-1/2 foot (2+ meter) strand, and put them in to the second Ziploc bag.  Zip it closed.Take the final 3 feet (1 meter) and put them in the third Ziploc bag. Zip it closed.You'll have a 6-inch (15 cm) end, 3 Ziploc bags (each with 3 feet / 1 meter of cord contained in them), and another 6-inch (15 cm) end. Stack the 3 bags flat on top of each other.  And next year you'll have no tangling (or very very very little, since a contained 3-foot / 1-meter section can't tangle much at all!).

Any tricks for treating a blister so I can go running without it reappearing?
In the end, I found a solution myself, quite similar to the recommended treatment for blisters already mentioned. I find this one quite more effective though.I found a link where they also explain the process, but I'll sum it up here just in case.You'll need:1 Sewing needleSome white thread (no color threads as they contain dyes)BetadineBand-Aid(s)1 Sterile gauze (or moleskin)A pair of small scissorsTake a needle and put a thread through it.Soak both in betadine for a couple of minutes.Go through your blister with the needle, so it will leave two holes with thread emerging from both. The fluid will drain out of theblister.Separate the thread from the needle, leaving it inside the blister. Move it back and forth to soak the inside of the blister withbetadine, but be careful to keep the blister intact.Cut some thread from each side until there's a little less than 2cm outside each side of the blister.Cover the blister with a Band-Aid and avoid getting the area wet for at least 24h.Now, if you have to train the next day, also put a gauze instead of the band-aid. It will prevent some of the rubbing and also soak any liquid it may come out during training. You can also use moleskin. I've been said it's better than gauze, so feel free to try it.After 24h, the blister should be mostly cured and given the case the thread should beremoved.Have in mind this method could also help curing hand-blisters. But the blister should be intact before we apply it (And after).
Any tricks for treating a blister so I can go running without it reappearing?
The reason it continues to fill up with liquid is due to the friction caused by your toe rubbing in the sock/against your shoes.The only way you'll be able to "prevent" it as such, allowing you to run, is to wrap it in a band-aid/dressing/etc.The most permanent solution is to get shoes tailored to your feet. If they're causing friction against your feet then a blister is the least of your concerns.
Any tricks for treating a blister so I can go running without it reappearing?
this is what i did when i ran XC in high school and got blistersPop the blister and drain itCut off the dead skin, with sterilized (soaked in alcohol) snips, that makes up the blister so you are left with a crater (this wont hurt unless you cut into the live skin)Let the crater skin under where the blister was dry out a bitI used to just put superglue over the exposed skin but you can either use new skin or just wrap it with a band-aid if you dont want to use superglue.  If you use a band-aid make sure to change it regularlyAlso as the comments say you should look into new shoes and/or socks, wet feet = blisters, make sure you get good breathing shoes and always put on clean socks before you go running
How to keep dust from matte/rubbery plastic
There is a product I've seen floating around called "Cyber Clean", which essentially is some kind of special goo that can get into the groves of your keyboard and clean out all of the dirt.The process seems simple enough, as documented on the site:Remove the compound from its packaging and knead it for about 10 seconds. This allows the compound to adapt to the pH value of your skin. Use only with dry hands.Place the compound on to the surface you wish to clean and press firmly to allow Cyber Clean to enter into all gaps and crevices.Pull the compound out. Dirt and bacteria are trapped inside the membrane system. Repeat cleaning action if necessary.Put the compound back into its re-sealable packaging and close it carefully to ensure the compound remains fresh. Store the product in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight.Your other viable option is using compressed air, which you can buy in a can, to clean the dust away.
How to light a candle without a lighter or a match
I did a Google search for "battery paperclip fire" finding many entries one of which is >> hereTake an AA, AAA, C, or D size battery. With a knife cut the circumference of the battery at the negative terminal one-sixteenth of an inch from the end, remove the covering, and expose the terminal. With the tip of the knife separate the terminal a little bit from the rest of the battery, just enough to insert the end of a paperclip or staple. Insert the small of wire into the opening. It will begin to get hot. Move for maximum effect. Because it will not be hot enough to light the candle, light some tinder such as extremely fine wood shavings. When there is a flame on the wood shavings, use that to light a small stick of wood, then use the stick to light the candle.Another good article is >> here listing six ways. A 9V battery and steel wool looks good.To get the candle lit, in each case a small fire will have to be made, a stick lit in the fire, and the candle lit from the stick.
How to get rid of carpet indents
Moisture is quite efficient in removing carpet indents, and this is also a main effect of taking our carpet away to a carpet cleaning service or washing it.Of course this can not be done on a carpeted floor when the carpet cannot be removed.Nevertheless we still have some options to apply the necessary amount of moisture to make the carbet fibers stand up again. All of these have in common that we do have to take care to not wet the carpet, and to let it dry sufficiently to avoid water stains, deformations, or even molding.Ice cubesGently rub the affected area with an ice cube. This will ensure that only little water gets into the fabric, and the mechanical action will help the fibers to get in line again. Take care to stop before the carpet is all wet. It is all about applying just a bit of humidity.Steam ironWith a houshold steam iron we can apply steam at desired amounts but this may need testing as not all carpets are heat resistant. To further prevent damage to the carpet it will help to cover affected areas with a damp cloth or towel and iron the cloth or towel above. This can also be done with a non-steam iron.Professional carpet cleaning machinesLarger areas may need a more throughout approach as can be achieved by renting a professional carpet cleaning machine. Wet cleaning machines may come with a special cleaning fluid that may work better than pure water. These machines will inevitably leave quite an amount of moisture in the carpet. We should carefully let it dry before we use the room again. To avoid molding we also need enough of ventilation. Therefore cleaning a carpet this way is better been done in summer.
How to keep dust from matte/rubbery plastic
There are a couple of methods that I can think of to remove the dust from these types of objects:Wash itIf the item is not going to be damaged from a dose of water, give it a quick clean with a sponge and some warm soapy water and rub it down with a clean towel afterwards, this will get rid of any dust on the material but would be a pain having to do it all the time.Sticky TapeI am not sure if this would completely work but if you got a couple of lengths of sticky tape or duct tape and 'wax' the rubber as you would a hairy leg (if that's what you're into) then this might rip the dust particles away from the material.Could also work with something like Blu Tack, just dab over the area and it should come away.There are however not many ways of preventing the dust from accumulating in the first place although one idea I did think of was that you could wrap the object in a clear film such as cling film. However this will likely be a stupid idea as the object will be rubbery and sticky for a reason and coating it would remove the sticky aspect of it - unless you ahve some mega clingy cling film!
How to light a candle without a lighter or a match
You can use a dry spaghetti noodle placed on hot oven (some people also suggest Doritos), when it start burning try to light a candle. You can also use a hot charcloth (See: lighting candles with charcloth and How to make charcloth?). Then the procedure is to catch a spark at one end of the charcloth roll, then place the seam of the charcloth roll against the candle. If this won't work, you can light candles, by placing them in a microwave oven.Here is video demonstration by Survivaltek: How to light candles with a microwave oven (be careful as it can damage your microwave or create a plasma ball, if it's too long inside or the power is too high).
More effective way to clean a CD/DVD?
Buy a tube of profi-paste (gritty professional tooth-paste) and slather about 2 finger-fulls onto the shiny side of the CD and gently swipe your index and middle finger finger in a roundabout motion around that side of the CD for a full 5 minutes. Wash off the excess tooth paste with lukewarm tap water, shake off excess water and dry it off with a lint-free cloth (no paper towels/toilet paper, ... as they will aggravate the problem! Micro-fibre is best) and then insert it into the CD drive and it'll allow you to copy them one last time... (Don't continue using them; just make a copy or ask someone to copy them for you!)Just throw them away afterwards...
How to remove printed labels from the backing easily?
It depends on the type of tape -- some are darn-near impossible to peel! To get it started, though, I sometimes resort to using duct-tape to grab the tape where it starts. That doesn't always work, particularly for the more stretchable tape. The other thing I've done is put on magnifiers so I can even see the start and use fine-pointed tweezers to start it.BTW, once started, after you cut off what you need, stick a small piece of paper or plastic at the end of the roll so you don't have to struggle next time.
How to remove printed labels from the backing easily?
What I do to remove printed labels is bend the paper slightly at the corner or edge of the label. The corner of the label should pop up where it can be grabbed. The backing is made so the label will come off easily. If necessary use a knife blade to help the edge of the label pop up while bending the paper.
How to remove rust from tools
I think the absolute definitive way to do it is with electrolysis. This is where you place the rusty component in an electrolytic solution (can be water with a salt dissolved in it) and run a current through the rusty piece and a "sacrificial" piece of metal via the solution. It works similarly to electroplating but instead of depositing a coating on a metal, it removes the rust. I've never done it and I think it's a bit of an effort to set up the first time, but after you've made a rig to do it, it's the most effective way. I wouldn't set this up if I had just one piece to do, but if I had say 5 items to do and they were fairly rusty then I probably would. One of the major benefits is that this can be used for VERY rusty tools, cast iron pans, etc. and does not damage the "healthy" metal underneath the rust. It also doesn't require any harsh chemicals or hard scrubbing.There's an example here http://www.instructables.com/id/Electrolytic-Rust-Removal-aka-Magic/ but if you search for "electrolysis rust removal" (without quotes) or similar on google then you'll find tons of results.I believe that after using this (or any) method, you should dry the items thoroughly (in a warm oven can be a good way, though not if there are wood/plastic parts) and oil them to protect from further rusting. This is especially important if working on cast iron (use vegetable oil if the items are cooking utensils/pans) as this will rust very quickly if not dried out and protected.
How to remove printed labels from the backing easily?
If you have a VERY SHARP craft knife, score the backing so that it leaves your sticker unharmed but cuts right through the backing. This isn't easy but if you have a lot to do then it will get easier with practice.You then bend the sticker lightly at the score line and the 2 edges of the backing will pop up along the cut to be easily removed.This is the trick they use on self-adhesive labelling machine tape and I've copied it on double-sided tape and on sticking-plasters.
How to remove printed labels from the backing easily?
Get two 2-inch pieces of adhesive tape (like Scotch tape or masking tape).  Fold over about half an inch on each, to leave a short non-adhesive section. Then stick one of the pieces of tape on the front of your "double sided sticky tape like sticker", and stick the other on the back.  You should then be able to pull the 2 pieces apart.Your adhesive tape may mess up the label, it's true. With practice (experimentation) you'll learn how much of the adhesive surface to apply to your label, and how hard to press it on. And you'll be able to apply your adhesive tape tabs without messing up the label.

More effective way to clean a CD/DVD?
There still may be scratches on the disk diffusing the light. CDs do not go "bad" as magnetic media will, but they may become scratched or scuffed at an inopportune place without being apparent. If the quality of recording is near the threshold of readability, any change to the surface may render it unreadable.There is the banana trick among other things. Rub a fresh banana onto the CD, clean off with the inside of the banana peel, then wash with soap and water. The wax left behind may fill in scratches and improve readability. Probably any type of wax will work, but if thick wax is used it will have to be buffed down onto the surface. Buffing is creation of heat through friction.  http://www.geeksaresexy.net/2007/08/11/how-to-use-a-banana-to-fix-a-scratched-cd-or-dvd/An older CD player may read the disk. After trying many players in different computers you may find one that plays it.Another option is to obtain software specially made to read the CD. It will try over and over and over again to read the bad spot until hopefully successful.Try placing the CD in the freezer then placing in the reader directly from the freezer. Also try warming it a little bit. The hope is to change the dynamic just enough to go back over the threshold of readability.

Get Just a Portion of a Block of Frozen Pasta
If you can anticipate that need, try to divide leftovers into individual portions before you freeze it so not to run into this problem. But that doesn't necessarily mean breaking it up into multiple containers piled into your freezer. If the freezer bag is not too full, I've been known to "pinch" or section off portions of the bag before it freezes solid. Those big snack clips make great dividing tools if you clamp it on from the outside. That way you can more-easily break off chunks along the frozen perforations you created. Depending on how wet the food is, you can also try to divide portions between layers of wax paper before freezing. The layers don't have to separate the food completely. Adding two layers of wax paper between the portions as you add them to the bag is typically enough to let you slip a knife in there and break them apart after they freeze solid.But barring any of these pre-preparation methods, you can pop the frozen mass in the microwave and start defrosting it just enough to loosen it up a bit. You don't want to completely defrost a giant block of food you intend to refreeze; it will turn to mush or get that warmed-over taste many times over (yuck). But microwaving the block just long enough to get past that "solid mass" stage will usually loosen it up so it can be broken apart with a knife. A block of food just below freezing is much easier to break apart than something that has been sitting in the deep freeze.
How do I apply cold solid spreads (butter/cheese) evenly on breads/sandwiches in a short time?
If you are making several pieces of toast and have access to an oven then melt your butter (microwave, stove top, oven) then use a kitchen brush to apply the butter, then cook the toast in the oven on a cookie sheet. Use the broil setting and flip the toast once to get both sides. The oven toast will be MUCH better than toaster toast. 
How to prevent the rubber peg on a flip-flop from popping out
The best hack for this is to use a bread clip. Push the peg back through the hole. Now put the bread clip around the broken peg. You don't have to, but you can glue it using super glue for more strength.If you don't have a bread tab or you want the extra strength, but you don't have super glue, you can just use hair pin or a paper clip. You'll have to put a hole in the peg. You can do this by actually drilling a hole, but you can also poke something sharp through like a knife. Now you put just put the hair pin or paper clip in the hole and you're good to go.Sources: WikiHow, LifeH4cks

My suggestion is to hit the block with a hammer. If a sledge hammer is used, go easy. If a smaller hammer is used, force is required. Put the pieces not wanted back in the bag. I would probably spread out newspaper on the garage floor and smash there. Newspaper is relatively germ-free.

Get Shampoo and Conditioner Out of My Eyes
Not exactly a hack for getting shampoo and conditioner out of your eyes, but try avoiding getting them there in the first place. Tilt your head back as you shampoo or condition your hair and the shampoo and conditioner will tend to drip backwards instead of down your face. For the duration in which the shampoo or conditioner will be resting on your head, try to avoid tilting your head forward. Also, if you feel as if the stuff is starting to get into your eyes, close them, then wet your hands and brush the stuff away.On the other hand, let's say you manage to get shampoo or conditioner - or even soap for that matter - in your eyes. First, get the water running and cup your hands in the stream. Take this water and gently press it into your face (don't jam it into your face), wiping slightly. I've found that this always works for me.
Replacement For Slow Cooker
An electric stove would be difficult, but if you have a gas stove, turn it up high and stir while getting it hot, then back off to a very small flame - very small. This will work. Adjust the flame up or down until perfect. Stir often and be sure to scrape the bottom to avoid sticking.To fully emulate a crock pot use a pan that evenly distributes heat.I don't recommend leaving a pot on the stove unattended, even with a small flame, which you can do with a crock pot.An electric stove can be used, but control is not as precise and may be prone to hot spots which will burn or cause sticking.
Replacement For Slow Cooker
Use the oven. It should have a thermostat so you can control the heat going to your pot. Also it is much more heat than on a stove. You get heat all around, including the lid. Just make sure the handles can handle the temperature you desire. Most pots have handles that can cope with slow-cook temps easily.For outdoors, there are some cool things you can do with fire, but that's kind of a different topic.
How to pick up small metal objects from the floor
The best choice is to use a magnet. All you have to do is is get a magnet bar that is about the length of five of your washers (bigger is better). Now just run the magnet over the washers and it will pick them up. Depending on the strength of your magnet, it may take more than one run.It will look something like this, but with metal washersImage SourceYou can also make your own electromagnet if you don't have a magnet. Just get a battery, a rubber band, stripped metal wire (see here for how to strip metal wire), and a bar of metal maybe a little longer, but thinner, than the magnet I described. Now wrap the wire around the metal bar as many times as you can, but leave a few inches so you attach the wire to the battery. Now put the ends of the wire on the battery and lock them into place with the rubber band. Note: Most batteries will work. The bigger ones are more powerful, but make get hotter faster, so find a good balance. This can get hot so handle with caution. If you are not able to get all the washers up quickly, disconnect the battery and let it cool down. I also recommend working with gloves.It will look like this, but with a metal bar.Image Source
Which is the fastest way to iron a long sleeved shirt with good results?
When it comes to ironing, training the fabric doesn't help much. Since the subject is ironing, permanent press with creases will not be mentioned since such are seldom ironed. When ironing a shirt, iron where the seam is first, move the iron lengthwise over the seam, stretch or flatten the fabric out with one hand, then move the iron over the rest of the fabric forming a crease on the opposite side. Take care not to have wrinkles under the iron since that will make unwanted creases in the middle and water will have to be applied to remove. The garment should lay flat when ironed properly, but sometimes garments are not well made and there may be a slight twist in a sleeve requiring special attention.There is no fast way to iron except through practice and becoming good at it. Becoming familiar with items of clothing and attention required to each item in past, helps.If using starch, there is spray starch in a can or starch mixed in a spray bottle. Sometimes sizing works better than starch. Which one used depends on preference as to the look when finished and amount of work required.A steam iron is generally used. If spray starch is not used, use a spray bottle of plain water and apply a light mist ahead of the iron, allowing the iron to dry the fabric.Edit: I failed to mention heat of the iron. Do not iron synthetic clothes. Too great a risk of damage. Too easy to leave shiny spots from the iron. If synthetics are ironed use low heat. For cotton use medium heat. Always keep the iron moving. Moving the iron quickly and with experience higher heat can be used.
Replacement For Slow Cooker
We use a Dutch oven for this. A common camping cookware. You can use it with charcoal below it and on the lid like you would when camping, put it in a grill on low heat, or in the oven at a low heat to mimic a slow cooker. Or if you have one without legs, or you saw them off, you can use it on a stovetop. Very versatile piece of cookware that is worth having for many reasons. You can cook with them at high heat too, but that won't be like using a slow cooker if you do. As a side note, thrift stores are a good place to find cheap slow cookers as well, maybe even a Dutch oven. 
Preventing soap from slipping in washbasin
This isn't really a hack unless you use any old dish you have available, but either use a soap dish (any small dish will do, but bear in mind the dish gets water in and the soap gets even soggier) or get hold of a soap saver - this is an oval or round, double sided suction pad (available on Amazon) - they stick to the sink and your soap can be stuck to the top if you press it hard enough after use. Other versions have a more needlelike arrangement on top to rest the soap on. You'd need to clean the soap saver regularly, but your soap will be drier on one of these than in a soap dish.Alternatively, ditch the bar of soap and  use liquid soap in a dispenser - no mess, no gunk.
Preventing soap from slipping in washbasin
Relatives of mine have a cool system. They have what looks like the screw cap on the top of a soda bottle, except it's not threaded, and it's made of magnetic metal.  They shove the open end of that into a bar of hand soap.  Then they have a magnet affixed to their sink that the metal bit (and the soap) sticks to. When the soap gets too small, they scoop the remaining soap out of the metal "cap" and shove it into another bar.Or you could get one of the soap holders in the picture below that doesn't hold water so the soap doesn't become "water logged".  You can glue or screw the soap holder to the little shelf you have so it doesn't fall off.  If it ever does need to be cleaned, use a kitchen scrub brush while pouring water on top of it.  (Sorry I couldn't find a better picture!)

How to remove printed labels from the backing easily?
One of my co-workers saw me struggling with this problem and pointed out that our labelmaker has a special tool built into the plastic next to the cutter. You stick the end of the label in and pull hard, and it curls the end of the label around and makes the two halves separate.If yours doesn't have this feature, you can achieve the same thing with a pen and its cap: Put the cap on the pen, slide the label between the pen and the clip on the cap, curl the label around (so it makes a U-turn around the clip), and pull hard. This forces the label and backing to separate at the end, and you can then easily pull them apart. (This works best if the clip is fairly close to the pen; a standard Bic ballpoint is perfect.)You can also buy labelmaker tape where the backing is split along the center, so you just fold in half lengthwise and it comes apart.

A great way to do this is actively used by the US military in the MREs (Meal Ready to Eat).

How to prevent an automatic toilet from flushing while I'm still using it?
After much trial and error, it seems that automatic toilet flushers will generally only ever do this if one is wearing a black shirt (or more precisely, if any portion of one's back is covered with a very dark color). This is presumably because dark colors absorb the infrared light that automatic toilets use to detect one's presence, which makes them uncertain about whether or not the person is still sitting down.Ever since I realized this, I've made sure that I never wear black fabric as my outer layer of clothing when going to a public restroom; and sure enough, it has never happened to me since.

If you don't mind luke-warm soup, a hand-warmer using the oxidation of iron can reach ~50°C. See this PDF of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society. Another heat source is hexamethylenetetramine or "hexamine", sold in tablet form. A light-weight heater can be made from a can; see Solid Fuel Burner. This site also lists some alternative fuels, such as trioxane. Just put a can of soup on top of the can with the burning tablet. If you want to use a glass container, put a wire grid on top of the burner to spread heat a bit.

Really cheap;Get some black or very dark cloth - old curtains, tablecloths, anything - sew or pin or tack it into a big sheet. It has to be oversized and you may need several layers to get it light-proof. Now you need a curtain rod; a broomstick, long stick, rod or long piece of wood. Hang the cloth over it. Now get the curtain rod in place. hold it up by more rods (with Vs cut in the end and leaning against the wall), or put it between two tall pieces of furniture, or step ladders, or attach it with wire to any curtain fitments you already have.Now tuck in and roll up the extra fabric till it's nice and dark. You can fix corners with thumbtacks. Voila!
How can I effectively black out my room for sleeping, cheaply and such that I can still open the curtains during the day?
All solutions to block light involve attaching some light absorbant material to the inside of your windows. This can be made of any material as long as it is lightproof. Solutions that integrate with the windows such as curtains, shutters, or the like may be too expensive, and they need at least some reconstruction to be made.An easy and very cheap solution that comes to my mind is a cardboard cut to the exact size of your window frame. In case the cardboard becomes shabby we can replace it with the same ease.Make a piece of plywood the size of the window. This can be attached to the window frame using e.g. Velcro strips or attach with hook screws (in case we are allowed to mount them). The plywood could be painted with any color to please our eeyes.What we do in our home is attaching a stretched canvas (as can be mande DIY or obtained in any size from an artist's supply store) having the size of the window opening and sitting on the window sill. Cover the back with aluminium foil or paint the canvas black for making it 100% opaque. We could even use a custom made photo print on canvas the size of our window.
How can I "wear in" my shoes without wearing them?
I had some uniform shoes which weren't wide enough, and the shoe-shop lady sold me some wooden shoe stretchers - essentially feet with springs in - and advised me to put wet socks on them and leave them overnight. This helped, but since they still weren't quite wide enough I wrapped paper around the stretchers, a bit more each day, and repeated the process.

An also very easy, cheap and quick solution could be using aluminium foil.Just stick it in front of your windows and your room should be blacked out perfectly!
How can I effectively black out my room for sleeping, cheaply and such that I can still open the curtains during the day?
Dirt cheap solution:Get a roll of black garbage bags and sew them onto the back of your curtains. If it'd get too hot in direct sunlight, try a layer of aluminum foil on top.Or save some pizza boxes, cut & tape them to your window size and place or tape them there. Easily removable.
What is the easiest way to get rid of spilled glitter?
You can try to do several things. If you do all of this maybe the glitter will be removed:Vacuum it with powerful vacuum cleaner (maybe several times)Take the carpet outdoors and beat it with carpet beater (then you can vacuum it again)Wash the carpet with pressure washer
What is the easiest way to get rid of spilled glitter?
If its a fitted carpet, hopefully short piled and not long, the only answer is a more powerful vacuum cleaner, as suggested already in Vladiz's answer. If its not fitted, then his suggestion of beating it thoroughly outdoors should get the majority of it out.Not sure about 'pressure washer' - a dedicated carpet washer might work, but the ones made for home users often don't suck loose stuff (never mind dirt) up as well as a good vacuum cleaner, so you'd probably need a professional carpet cleaning company to do it.
Preventing soap from slipping in washbasin
Take a plastic box with size similar to the soap and make several holes on the bottom to prevent filling it with water. I sometimes use a box of ice-cream or cheese which here are strong enough and not easy to break. Then you can fix this plastic box with some glue, sanitary silicon or tie it for something with some wire.
De-pill the clothes?
I have a "pullover shaver" especially for this, but maybe that doesn't count as a hack. On the other hand it was dead cheap and jumpers can be worn for much longer, it saved its own cost the first time I used it.I can't find the English name behind the firewall here, but you can google "Fusselrasierer" to get the idea.
What is the easiest way to get rid of spilled glitter?
In my country (Italy) there is a famous vacuum cleaner company which provides demonstrations of their really (really really) powerful vacuum cleaner.All you have to do is call them and ask for a free demonstration in cleaning your carpet.  Usually they demonstrate the product on your mattress, and you don't really want to know what they can clean from it (judging from the quantity of dead cells on the mattress you should be vanished by now).
How to pick up small metal objects from the floor
Masking tape is another trick that may be convenient if a magnet isn't on hand. Take a big piece, pick up as many as you can, pull them off, repeat. Use a new piece of tape if it loses its stickiness.Edit: The technique is to use one hand, slowly pull the length of tape through the air and gently put it down so it lays flat and touches as many items as possible. Use your other hand to glide down the length is the tape, pressing it down onto any objects underneath. Then pick it up on whatever way seems to not drop the items.
Replacement For Slow Cooker
A tea candle with a pot raised over it will work. (Your stove may be a suitable place to put the pot and the candle.) You need a lid, and it won't be hot enough if your environment is really cold. In my area (ambient temperatures are warm), it normalizes a lot cooler than boiling, but too hot for sous-vide. Use two candles and a thermometer if you want it hot.
How to warm a meal when camping or in the wild
If you've opened your can and maybe removed a little bit, you can heat it on coals. It takes a long time and you need to stir, but you did say you didn't want to carry extra tools.Note that you'll need to move it when the coals underneath get cool.
How to remove rust from tools
I second the solution for electrolysis. The only problem with that is you need a good voltage source of at least 4 volts (12 would be better), or a current source of at least 1 amp. It will be very slow if your power is limited. And I wouldn't bother finding the cleaners that are suggested on the internet. If you are doing one job, use whatever you have at home. Anything from baking soda to lye is acceptable. (For reference, 0.5% concentration of lye in water does not cause significant irritation to your skin, at least not in a short time. You can search online for "naoh irritant concentration" for more information.)If you find this slow process annoying, you can pickle it with an acid. HCl is cheap and available. Soak it in HCl for a while, quickly rinse it and get it covered in a dilute base to neutralize the remaining acid, rinse it in water, and scrub it with a wire brush. Dry it at a high temperature, but I don't advise using a flame.With either process, it will rust as you're wire-brushing it before it dries, but the bigget danger is leaving acid on it in the open air for more than a few moments.
How can I effectively black out my room for sleeping, cheaply and such that I can still open the curtains during the day?
I'd invert the problem and ask if you'd be comfortable wearing a sleep mask such as the ones airlines give you. I'm guessing even premium versions of these are less expensive than any blackout shades or curtains you'd find.Obviously I know nothing about your specific sleep sensitivity, but I've found I sleep like a baby in an earthquake when I wear ear plugs.
What is the easiest way to get rid of spilled glitter?
Try a lint roller -- one of those rolls of adhesive tape with a handle on it, where the tape's adhesive is on the outside. I use that for oddball cleanups on carpet sometimes.You'll go through a lot of layers of the tape, and probably several lint rollers. But it probably works better than the air suction of a vacuum.

Use a butter dish. It may be inconvenient, but you can stop the soap from slipping if it's big enough!
How to quickly break in shoes?
There are a few methods that I have heard of and found after looking:Freeze themIf you put a sandwich bag half filled with water (or enough to fill the shoe) inside the shoe and place in a freezer for a few hours. The water will expand once frozen so will apply pressure to the shoes making them also expand. This would also work with damp balls of newspaper - just make sure the shoes won't get damaged by the water.Apply heatIf you wear them for about 10 minutes and then give them a good bend (if possible) in order to manually stretch the leather, and then apply heat from a hair dryer or something similar in order to make the shoes more supple (especially if leather) and thus more stretchable. Immediately after heating - put them back on for a further few minutes and allow them to mould to your feet and once they've cooled you should be good to go.Use a stretcherThere are shoe stretchers commercially available that will stretch your shoes and make them more comfortable, but you can also make your own. For example you can use a large potato and push that into the shoe and this will help to stretch it out.Stretching sprayAs much as I like to avoid product recommendations I thought I would put it here for people who aren't aware of it. You can get sprays that are designed to loosen the leather material and make them stretch and expand so they're more comfortable when you put them on!Call a professionalIf you're not happy with any of these methods you can always just call a professional cobbler and they will be able to offer you a shoe stretching service for a reasonable charge I am sure.
How can I effectively black out my room for sleeping, cheaply and such that I can still open the curtains during the day?
My windows have sills.I like to use 1-2" foam.  Either single, or paired and packing-tape connected to make a single panel.  It comes in 4x8 sheets, you cut it to fit, and seal the edges with an iron and waxed paper / aluminum foil (because otherwise the edge you cut sheds bits).This blocks light (you may need a bit of squishy foam around the edges for a perfect seal), as well as blocks heat / cold.The panels are removable, so when you want to open the window you can take the panel out, and the window is fine.Unfortunately they've gotten rid of the white-sided stuff, which allowed you to double face it so it was white on both sides - and didn't make your room look ghetto from the outside (and the inside).  You can cover the inside with a curtain.The temperature difference is significant on the cooling and heating bills, as well as making the room much more pleasant to be in, temperature-wise - and it's great for light too.For the garbage-bag solution, some people are using the cheap garbage-bags (which are see-through), you'd want the contractor grade garbage bags which are 3 mils, or 5 mils thick.
How do I apply cold solid spreads (butter/cheese) evenly on breads/sandwiches in a short time?
You could build or buy a butter knife with holes in the blade that function as a grater. Start with a butter knife with a rounded back, so you could spread with both sides. (Both sides are important for this.) Put a row of holes (I would try 3-4mm first) along the edge (perhaps around 1mm from the edge, with 1-2mm of steel left separating the holes, for strength). You will need a drill press for this, since the drill bit will wander if you do it by hand, and the holes will end up unevenly placed, and probably joined with each other. A high speed grinding tool would also probably work.To use it, drag it over the butter with an acute leading angle, so the butter is pressed up into the hole and "grated". Then flip the knife around and spread the grated butter on your bread.An Instructable is here:http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Butter-Knife-for-Spreading-Cold-Hard-Butter/A Kickstarter campaign started this idea, but it's over now:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1070983896/the-stupendous-splendiferous-butterup?ref=nav_search
How do I apply cold solid spreads (butter/cheese) evenly on breads/sandwiches in a short time?
Mash the butter on the side of the plate with the knife. Doing this a few times warms the butter from the plate, and makes it spreadable. 
How to quickly break in shoes?
When I was in the military a crazy guy wore his into the shower.  Swore that you do that and walk them dry and they will be perfect.  He was the only one of us not to get blisters.  Still not sure how that worked after walking around in soaking wet boots...Might work for other shoes too.
How do I apply cold solid spreads (butter/cheese) evenly on breads/sandwiches in a short time?
For spreading cold butter, just cut some off the block and then mash it up a bit then it will spread nicely.
How do I keep my shirt collars from folding the wrong way?
Not sure right now of how to prevent this, but I know a hack to fix it with a straightening iron. Get the crease you want with your hands as good as you can. Now straighten the crease just like it is hair (you've probably seen a girl do this on TV, or maybe in person). This will keep the creases straight and may help it stay that way too.

What is the easiest way to get rid of spilled glitter?
In your question you said that you can't vacuum because the glitter is sticking. One way to help get the glitter unstuck is to use rubbing alcohol with a towel on the glitter. This will get up some of the glitter and help loosen the bonds of the rest. Now it will be easier to vacuum. I would also recommend using the part of the vacuum that you hold with your hand because a smaller suction area is more powerful. You can also use masking tape. Wrap the masking tape around your hand so that the sticky side is facing out. Now you'll have to get down on the ground and use the tape to get up as much glitter as possible. This combination of vacuuming and tape can be very effective. 
How can I tell if I've applied deodorant?
This is going to sound weird so don't judge me.I am assuming it is antiperspirant (otherwise it defeats the point of having non-fragrant) so once it is applied, if you rub your fingers or hand in your armpits and then lick them (weird part). If the antiperspirant has been applied then it should feel really dry on your tongue and your fingers should almost stick to your tongue momentarily. If there is none applied it will be slightly unpleasant but you will have your answer.
How can I tell if I've applied deodorant?
You can touch your armpits and notice the texture.Alternatively, you can develop the habit of putting the deodorant in front of the door after you use it. That way, if it's in its place, you know you haven't used it yet. And this system is self-resetting, because when you go out in the morning, you must replace the deodorant where it belongs before you pass through the door.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
What kind of sandals do you have? Birkenstocks work great. Hold it by the toe strap and swing it. Put your wrist into it. Try to swing it at where the fly will go instead of where the fly currently is. The impact flings it across the room and stuns it or kills it.Bonus solution: Do you have pugilistic tendencies? After a month or two of boxing training, I found I could catch gnats in my hand, with a punching/grabbing motion. I'm sure the same thing works for flies, but I always try to commit insecticide in a manner that leaves little blood on my hands.
How can I tell if I've applied deodorant?
Take a look at the surface of your roll-on stick:Dull and dry surface: the roll-on was not used in the last 10 minutes.Glossy and wet surface: you had used it recently.The amount of containing fluid may however vary between brands, so it may not always be that obvious.Alternatively and in case your container was transparent you could also watch for a fluid level in the container:No level visible: the deodorant was evenly distributed on the inner surface of the container. Due to the high viscosity it will take some time to settle. You had used or moved it recently.Fluid level visible: (on the botom when stored upright, at the sides when stored lying) the deodorant was not used recently.
How to quickly cure hiccups
There are loads of methods that people will swear by, but the ultimate point of all the methods is to really concentrate on something else to take your mind off them and they normally go for some reason!I use a couple of methods and one I had never failed with:Get someone else to give you a drinkIf you have someone to hand, get them to pour a glass of water or something into your mouth, as you're not used to it then it'll require extra concentration (and a little bit of panic you'll drown if they don't stop) and after about 5-10 seconds of drinking they'll be completely gone. That's with my personal experience anyway!  Drink a glass of water upside downRight, this'll require a picture for explanation:As you can see from this lovely image, you're not actually upside down but you kind of are... Basically this is just very confusing to do and requires immense concentration to pull off and normally cures hiccups as well!There are a couple of other methods I've tried and other people swear by but never have as good (if any) results:  Hold your breath for 20 secondsGet someone to scare you (never works as you know they're going to scare you...)
How to quickly cure hiccups
There are lots of purported folk remedies for hiccups. Inasmuch as some of them work at all, it isn't clear to what extent this is for physiological or psychological reason, or just because hiccups eventually goes away on its own and people only remember that it went away while they were trying something.For medical references, I refer you to threads on Skeptics Stack Exchange:Does drinking water upside-down help cure hiccups?Can scaring a person cure hiccups?These two methods probably don't work though these threads don't offer conclusive proof that they work.One method that seems to work for several people (it's worked for me too) is to swallow as much air as possible and maintain tension on your diaphragm. I breath in to the point where I can't do it anymore and then hold my breath for a minute or so; it usually works for me. I don't know to what extent this is physiological. Tanath reports that it “works immediately and every time” (for me, it takes a minute or so and only works most of the time). John C notes that what matters is tension on the diaphragm, not holding your breath per se (I can confirm that it doesn't work if I don't breathe in fully before holding my breath).The NYU medical center offers several possible remedies with no explanation:Eating hard to swallow items such as granulated sugar or molassesSucking on ice cubesGagging with purposeValsalva maneuver — holding your breath and bearing down, as you might when having a bowel movementBreathing into a bag
How to quickly cure hiccups
One method is to fill the lungs with air, and when they are full, pull in a little bit more, then squeeze very hard for fifteen or twenty seconds. The purpose of this is to help the diaphragm relax and quit spasming. Doing this a few times should end the hiccups.When that does not work, for people who cannot stop hiccups over several hours, the official cure is stimulation of the vagas nerve. The vagas nerve can be stimulated through orgasm or using a finger to massage the anus. http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/09/04/3582324.htm
How do I effectively remove dog hair from carpets?
An alternative for the top answer (which is great for the floors) : you can put on rubber gloves (Like the pink ones you can buy in any stores), and then rub/brush off easily any hairs from any surfaces (sofas, etc. the floor too, but watch your posture ^^ ).
Any tricks for treating a blister so I can go running without it reappearing?
Well, so I actually came across another answer while around Youtube. It's explained in this video (no blisters or any kind of disgusting things are shown, so feel free to check it out)The main treatment for a blister usually revolves around pricking it with a needle to drain it (which could cause an infection), or let it be (which is not much of a treatment). But in this case, the girl in the video talks about Benzoyl peroxide, a substance used in acne treatment that can dry out the liquid from the skinBasically, she takes an acne cream containing 5% Benzoyl and applies a small amount of it on top of the blister. Later, she covers it with a bandit and according to her it was completely flat the next day.I (fortunately) didn't try it myself, as I didn't get any more blisters, but I thought it was worth mentioning as it doesn't involve anything invasive.
How to quickly cure hiccups
Getting the wind knocked out of you cures them 100% of the time. Find someone and ask them to give you a light but firm punch/chop to the stomach when you're not paying attention. It doesn't take much force to knock the wind out of someone who isn't aware what's about to happen. This doesn't mean gasping for breath, you can kind of half-knock the wind out of someone and that works just as well.Whether you willing to go through with this or not is up to you, but it's worked for me and on others back in my college/partying days. Nothing ruins a night quite like a case of the hiccups that simply won't pass, and 10 seconds of discomfort seemed worth it!
What is the easiest way to get rid of spilled glitter?
I Agree with other posts use a powerful vacuum cleaner to get it out of the carpet. This to say a standard vacuum cleaner is not likely to do the job, so you may need alternates.A shop vacuum would work well. They have high suction with a variety of attachments that well may work to get the glitter.A carpet cleaning machine. Handheld or consumer models all offer a higher suction then a conventional vacuum cleaner and can be bought from about 40 USD for a handheld to several hundred USD for a stand up model. If just air does not pull the glitter out you can try the detergent and water, which gives you even more agitation and chemical to release the glitter from your carpet.Rent a carpet cleaner. Available at many grocery stores, hardware stores and rental yards, check your local listings. Cheaper then buying and the machines are generally a little more powerful then buying.And last resort is a professional carpet cleaner whom have very powerful equipment and can get the job done.  I see as I write that you accepted lint roller as the answer, if that works that is great.

No one ever mentions this one, but I realized that if I imagine that I'm mad at something and yell really loudly about it for a few seconds, the hiccups never come back. 
How to tell if a door is locked just by looking
You can rig a little red LED on the door. You will need to dismantle the lock, which is easy, by taking out the two screws. Mount a battery, and micro switch within the cavity. Position the switch so it turns off when the lock is engaged. Drill a small hole to insert the LED so it will be visible from the desired direction. Flashing LEDs are also available, too!
How to tell if a door is locked just by looking
You could simply add a couple of stickers or markings on the twisty thing that would make you know if it is in the correct position or not, it would make it easier to identify from a distance away whether or not it is locked without having to try the handle.If I am mistaken and I have misunderstood what your lock looks like and where you are trying to determine its locked state from (i.e. Outside the house and the knob is on the inside) then I apologise and that last bit is of little to no use for you. However, it you get in the habit of doing something unusual when you lock your door, like a body movement or shouting or something, then it will make it much easier to remember whether or not you have locked it once you've walked away.
How to quickly cure hiccups
Holding my breath has never failed. However, some people think this doesn't work for them, but I suspect it's because they don't use the correct technique when they try. I've encountered several people who had bad hiccoughs, and when I told them to hold their breath, they dismissed the idea saying "I tried that and it didn't work". When I told them the correct technique and they tried it, they got cured!Basically, as Gilles says, you have to hold your breath deeply, as deep as you can, i.e. get as much air into your lungs as possible. You also have to HOLD your breath for at least around twice the interval of your hiccoughs. So if you hiccough once every 10 seconds, you should hold your breath for at least 20 seconds. You should start holding your breath immediately after a hiccough, if you wait to hold your breath just before another hiccough comes, this method won't work.Good luck!
How do I know if my car tires have enough air without a guage?
Thump them like truck drivers do with a small bat or hammer. They will make a different sound if they are low, you can also look at how squat they are. Look at the tread and how it is wearing. Over inflated tires will tend to wear quicker in the middle, under inflated tires tend to wear quicker on the outside of the tread. Gauges are cheap typically less then five bucks for a simple one that will do the trick, and also most places you can get air have a built in gauge, although these gauges are notorious for being inaccurate. 
How do I determine the fastest speed to drive without getting a ticket?
While I would advise just simply sticking to the speed limits put in place for yours and others safety, there are a a couple of tricks I've picked up which work at least in the UK!Speed cameras have tolerances that are in place in order to stop people getting tickets when in fact they're travelling below the speed limit. After all it costs a fair bit for the authorities to distribute tickets and costs them even more if it gets disputed and thrown out, so it's in their interest to have accurate speed cameras!The tolerance that I have learned to go by is about 10% over the actual speed limit as I've heard that this is the possible error that a speed camera could present when measuring speed.A second point of interest is that car speedometers aren't actually all that accurate either, displaying slightly higher than you are actually going (this figure I was once told was +2mph) and if you've ever traveled with a sat nav in the car which shows speed, you'll have seen that the cars displayed speed is a fair bit higher than the reading on the sat nav. I have subsequently found out that the sat nav reading is actually the more accurate of the two (which I refused to believe for a long time) so if you're using one of those you can always ignore your own speedo and go with what that is saying.Even with all these measures I still change my speed depending on the road conditions and situations that I am in. If it's an empty motorway then I'll happily go 90-100mph unless there are speed cameras around at which point I will slow down to just over the speed limit (+5-10 mph) and I'll usually slow down a bit when passing other vehicles (just in case of unmarked police cars) as if you're caught going over 100mph (or twice the speed limit) you'll instantly lose your license and will be taken to court so I save those speeds for solo drives on lonely roads.After all that I would still just simply advise staying to whatever you're comfortable with, if you're going to break speed limits you've got to be prepared to risk getting a speeding ticket and to be honest sometimes people can just be outright idiots and deserve lose their license.Anyways, that's the work around a I use and have never got a ticket or anything but as I said, I live in the UK and I'm unaware of it is applicable internationally but it might be of use to you.
How do I determine the fastest speed to drive without getting a ticket?
The fastest speed you can drive without getting a ticket is the posted speed limit. In the US the cops will not typically mess around with anything under 5 mph over the speed limit. However they will use any amount over the speed limit as reason to pull you over and often just write you a warning. They will do this because they have some reason that they want to know more about you, what your doing, maybe think you might be driving drunk, or you look like you could be transporting drugs etc.In school zones there are very steep fines for even doing a mile or two over the speed limit. Here in NV they police school zones with a vengeance, and you just do not speed at all in them.In construction zones they have a zero tolerance and fines are doubled in most states. So you do not speed at all.Most states I understand from talking to truck drivers have a zero tolerance policy for commercial vehicles on the interstate. You will get pulled over for 76 MPH in a 75 MPH zone and written a speeding ticket if you are in a large semi truck.Me I just cruise the speed limit, never get tickets, and never get pulled over. Speeding in the city rarely gets you to your destination any faster and greatly increases your chance for an accident. Between drunk drivers and aggressive drivers the huge majority of accidents happen.    
How to remove a postage stamp from an envelope?
Cut the envelope around the stamp and then apply some liquid (water, adhesive remover or other) on the back of the envelope where the stamp is attached. let it soak for several seconds to make the adhesive dissolve a little and you will be able do remove the stamp easier without damaging it.As liquid for soaking the paper some people use:Adhesive remover - HeptaneWater - the simplest solution. Warm water works betterA pen with lubricant, for example "WD-40 no mess pen"If you don't mind getting the stamp wet, then simply put it in water for several seconds and the paper envelope will separate from the stamp very easily. After that let the stamp dry and you are ready. You can dry it by putting it on kitchen paper with the sticky part upwards - to avoid it sticking to the paper.You can also put the stamp on transparent plastic film and let it dry on that. It will stick on it and you can cut the plastic film next to the stamp edges. Thus way you will not have problems with the sticky back of the stamp and can examine the front and the back of the stamp easily. Another way to remove its stickiness is to put it in talc which will cover the back of the stamp. Actually you can't use stamps for second time as they apply ink on it in the post office.
How to improve mobile phone signal?
The most simple method is to go to a place with better signal. Go ona balcony or near to the window. Usually the signal outside isstronger. There is higher attenuation in the buildings.When talking with the phone next to your head the phone signal has3dB attenuation in human body. If you use a headset you can put thephone away from your head and hold it higher for better signalreception (or you can hold it out of the window). You can check the information for your cell phone to understand where the built in   antenna is placed to avoid covering it with hand whentalking. Some phones have their antenna in the upper part and othersin the bottom, so would depend on the manufacturer and model.Some of the older phones used to have a special connector for attaching anexternal antenna, but I haven't seen similar thing on new modelsduring the last 5 years.You can improve the reception with these methods only if the signal level in your case is a little below the useful level. If it is too weak then this won't help.
How to keep leftover pizza tasting fresh
StorageGet an airtight plastic container and line it with paper towels. Place a piece of pizza on the paper towels, then place some more paper towels on top. If you have more than one piece of pizza, repeat until all of the pieces are stored. If you plan to eat the pizza in the next 24 hours, store it in the fridge. Any time longer than that, store it in the freezer. ReheatingBefore you reheat, let the pizza warm up to room temperature/Oven (best when you have a lot of pizza)Preheat oven to 400o. Place the pizza on a baking sheet and bake it for 15 minutes. The pizza is good if the cheese is bubbly and crispy brown in spots.Toaster Oven (best for one or two slices)Preheat to 400o. Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 10 minutes. The cheese should look bubbly and gooey.Microwave (quickest, but least effective)Put not only the pizza (on a microwave safe plate is usually the best) in the microwave, but also put a half-filled glass of water. The water will prevent the heatwaves from going deep inside the pizza, making it only heat the crust and cheese. Reheat for 30 seconds.Source: WikiHow
How to improve mobile phone signal?
First, get to  higher elevation. Usually a balcony, or an upstairs window should do the trick. Now, don't move around. I know that many people walk around when talking on the phone (me included), but that makes it harder for the cell phone tower to make a connection.Some technological things you can do:Keep your phone charged - when a phone has more battery, it can work harder to get a signalHolding your phone correctly - most new phones have the antennas on the bottom of the phone.

I have successfully removed the lice with Nix.I bought it at a local drugstore.Here's how you use it:1. Use shampoo.2. Dry your hair.3. Spread half a bottle to one bottle of Nix on your head.4. Wait 10 minutes.5. Wash it off.6. Use the comb it comes with and try to scratch off the lice left.7. If it didn't work, try it again in a week.
Stopping a Faucet From Leaking
Short of taking the faucet apart and replacing the seat or other assembly, often times working the handle will cause it to stop leaking. Buildup inside will prevent it from completely closing. Working it back and forth with force can break up deposits allowing it to seat correctly. If there is light to moderate corrosion this may still work, but with corrosion the seat or other assembly inside must be replaced.Other than this there is nothing you can do for a leaky faucet except replace parts inside.
Stopping a Faucet From Leaking
A temporary fix is to use the shut-off valve under the sink.A permanent fix would require taking the faucet apart. Sometimes cleaning pieces -- especially the washers -- will help the parts seal again, thus preventing dripping. However, more often, parts such as the washer or (depending on the type of faucet) must be replaced. This isn't generally difficult.Note also that some brands of faucets have lifetime warranties. You can call their number, tell them what faucet you have and what isn't working, and they'll send you the parts for free.
How to quickly cure hiccups
"Holding your breath" is so nearly right, but missing the one vital point - you have to hold your breath out ie breathe out, then not breathe in for as long as you can manage. Sometimes you need to repeat this a few times too. Presumably it creates a subtle change in blood chemistry or something but, be that as it may, I can promise you, it works. 
What can be used besides rice to keep moisture out of salt?
I suggest getting large-grain rice that is big enough not to fall through the holes in the shaker. I did a Google search for "large grain rice" and found many entries. This may be slightly more expensive, but purchasing a bag of it should last a long time.
How do I know if my car tires have enough air without a guage?
A gauge is best, but gauges on gas station pumps are often inaccurate.. Looking at low profile tires can be deceptive. By pressing on the sidewall with a thumb, I get a better sense of pressure than by looking, but accurate only to ~30%. Kicking the sidewall (gently) can be used to make a tone, similar to the hammer, but I wouldn't expect better accuracy than by pressing.
What is the quickest way to cool down a room-temperature drink without pouring it over ice?

How to quickly cure hiccups
A school-teacher demonstrated a method that, she says, worked very reliable when her pupils (at an English girls' public school if that makes any difference) get hiccups. She asks the girl with hiccups to the front of the class and, with quite a bit of ceremony, ask the girl to hiccup in front of the entire class. The girl is then given a time limit (say 60 seconds) in which to hiccup and the class shout encouraging things to her. This - she told me - cures hiccups and it did work on the occasion that she demonstrated it to me.This may be strongly affected by culture and age, but my guess is that something about having to perform in front of a lot of people and the nervousness and apprehension involved suppresses the hiccup reaction.I thought it worth adding because it is the oddest method I have seen demonstrated. Personally I drink water while someone else tells me whether to start or stop at random intervals, which I suspect is much like the "other person gives you a drink" method.

If I break a water pipe, is there a way to stop the flow while I go turn off the water?
If the pipe is completely broken, crimp the end over or bend the pipe.   I put a spade thru an underground water pipe in the garden many years ago and it shot a fountain of water 30 feet (9 metre) into the air.... so I called the water utility  - a chap turned up and hit the pipe with a hammer until it stopped.  Good lesson 
What is the quickest way to defog car windows?
Instead of using warm air to defog your windshield, use cold air - it is much faster. Also, instead of putting on the air conditioner, switch it to windshield mode.
How to remove a postage stamp from an envelope?
Soak the bit of the letter with the postage stamp on it in water. After about half an hour, it will peel off easily (outside of water).
What can be used besides rice to keep moisture out of salt?
You can use dried parsley leaves to prevent moisture. Fill up 1/4 of the shaker and then put in the salt. You can also put in toothpicks, which will have the same effect. I prefer broken ones, but they have to be cleanly broken. One last method I know of is to use dry beans. I've done it with black beans, but I believe other types will work too.
What can be used besides rice to keep moisture out of salt?
Crackers (or pieces thereof) can serve as an alternative desiccant.  I've used saltine's with success.
How can I effectively black out my room for sleeping, cheaply and such that I can still open the curtains during the day?
Line your curtains with blackout liner fabric. There are different styles -- some attach to an existing curtain rod, and some attach to the curtains themselves with hooks.  The fabric is also available by the yard at some fabric stores.  If you shop around, you could find one on sale for under $10.  A sleep mask is a good backup, to mask any stray light that might leak around the edges of the curtain.
Is there something around the house I can use to protect/clean my suede boots?
I have suede shoes also and like to keep them clean, I have looked many times but I have never been able to find anything other than commercial protection products which are actually very good and can keep spills and liquids off keeping them dry and clean. Something that I personally use is Crep Protect which is fairly cheap and very effective - I run out of it quite quickly those which is a downside.In regards to cleaning them, you should really steer clear of using water on the suede as this can damage them.In the event that you spill something on the material, dry it quickly with a dry cloth and then apply talcum powder or cornmeal to the area and you will have to allow it to set overnight - this will draw out the remaining liquid and you can easily rub off the remaining powder with a soft bristled brush or cloth.You can also treat dried on stains with a small amount of vinegar and a cloth and just rub lightly and it should gradually work the stain out.Storage is quite a key thing as well with suede shoes and there are a couple of things that you should try to keep in mind:Let the suede breathWith other shoes you can normally store them in a box and in a cupboard, but with suede you should keep them out of tightly enclosed spaces. You can even put them inside a cotton pillow case if you're storing them in a closet and this will promote air circulation while also keeping them dust free.Keep in a cool dry placeAvoid leaving them exposed to direct sunlight while not in use as this will cause fading making them look old and worn out.You can easily bring the suede back to life should it begin to look tired and flattened - you can scrub it with a clean toothbrush or a terrycloth towel. If they're looking really bad you can hold them over steam from a boiling kettle for a few seconds and then give them a scrubbing.If all else fails you can take them to a professional cleaners to give them the treatment they deserve.
How can I effectively black out my room for sleeping, cheaply and such that I can still open the curtains during the day?
I had the same problem - not sure if my fix will work for you though. My bed has an adjustable frame, so I lowered the spring board all the way down and then fashioned a wooden plank to sit on top of the frame. Then I draped a thick, long quilt over the board, and it completely covers my bed - blocks out all the light and now I use the board/bed as a second desk. Only downside is there isn't a lot of room between the mattress and the board, so getting in was a little tricky the first few days. If your bed frame is such that you can do this, it works really great and is super convenient.
Any tricks for treating a blister so I can go running without it reappearing?
Treatment of blisters is a simple matter. While I don't personally recommend popping and draining them yourself (though with a blister in that particular spot, that may be the ticket), since then you have to treat it as an open wound, that is an option. But if you don't want to pop it, you do have other options.The treatment I have always been taught is moleskin, a self-adhesive padding to be applied to the site of the blister. It's extremely effective at keeping your blisters padded and comfortable (on a toe like that, it's a little awkward). If you can acquire such things as these, I cannot recommend it enough.In a pinch, duct tape is also an effective tool. It protects your blister in the same way, to prevent further irritation.
Any tricks for treating a blister so I can go running without it reappearing?
It is better to leave the blister for few days without popping it to let the skin under it heal. Better do not run on the next day, use the next day for recovery or cross training (train some other sport not involving your feet so intensively - cycling, fitness ...).If it is absolutely necessary for you to rn on the next day then use the Benzoyl peroxide to dry the blister, apply a medical band, and in the next run use baby powder on your feet to keep them dry when running.Blisters appear if your shoes are not comfortable or if your feet become wet while running.What you can do to prevent them next time:change your shoes with more comfortableuse socks for running - made of breathable material (synthetic in most cases) which does not keep moisture. Do not use socks with cotton as they tend to soak with water and keep your feet wetuse baby powder to keep feet dry
What is the best way to recondition a whiteboard?
The quickest trick to get rid of ghosting is to completely color the board with a black dry-erase marker and then erase with a dry (as in not wet) and clean microfiber cloth or eraser.  This works by applying the marker solvent evenly across the board, which will of course dissolve the remnants of powder left on the board as ghosting.Sometimes detergents cause their own problems, so I only use them if there is actual dirt on the board (from people's fingers or mishaps).  My standard "deep clean" technique is as follows:Tap / scrape / vacuum the excess dust off of your eraser & thoroughly erase the board from top to bottomUse a clean, soft cloth slightly dampened with plain water to gently wipe the last bits of dust off the board, again moving from top to bottom.Repeat step 2 until the cloth stops picking up marker dust.If there are stubborn marks, use a cloth dampened with isopropanol or 70%+ ethanol to gently remove them.Let the board dry thoroughly before using it.You want to avoid scratches and any kind of residue - waxy, soapy or greasy.  Good luck!

How to tell if a door is locked just by looking
Most doors, if you look on the inside, have a nub that locks into the side of your door. If it's in the hole it's locked. Of course, not all doors are like that. Sorry if your door is different.
How to determine if US paper money is genuine?
It would perhaps be wise to purchase a scanner if you are in a high risk industry like a bar or a club.  This will at least let your cashiers quickly check notes reasonably well in the variable lighting conditions. Otherwise I do not believe there is a hack to your question.  A study of the Secret Services "Know your money" website is your best path to becoming familiar with the US currency nuances.EDIT: Some background, I used to exchange US dollars in large numbers some time back. And quite often I would receive in a batch of $100 bills one or two fake notes. Fortunately my money changer were  understanding and sorted it out on my behalf.  This was in Singapore not the US FYI.However they recommend UV and Magnetic scanners as the only reliable way of identifying currency that is either in need of checking or outright fake. 
Kettle Not Whistling
The reason that kettles whistle is because of the holes in a kettle spout. Kettles usually have two plates for the spout cover. Your kettle might not have one of the plates.You can fix this with a bottle cap and some common tools. First bend the bottle cap with pliers (you can also use a hammer) so that the sides are up. Now use sandpaper to get the bottle cap round. Now drill a hole in the middle of the bottle cap. You should be able to just wedge the bottle cap in the spout cover, but if you can't, you can always use glue.Here's some good photos showing how to build the bottle cap cover  Source: Instructables
How to make a cellphone tripod?
In a pinch you can use socks and a rubber band:Get four pairs of socks that have been "folded" the way you fold socks. (I'm pretty sure everybody folds socks the same way, but just in case, I'm talking about folding them like this.) Arrange the pairs of socks in a 2x2 square, aligned like cans of beer in a 6-pack. Then pull a rubber band around them so that they're pulled snugly together.Stick your phone in the middle of this so that it bisects the sock quartet. If you push it in deep enough, the phone will be held in place by the pressure of the rubber band. You'll want to adjust the orientations of the socks and the rubber band so that the phone is aligned the right way (and there's no sock blocking the camera).If you use hefty socks, the resulting setup is fairly sturdy and surprisingly adjustable. The problem is that the camera is only lifted a few inches above whatever surface you place the socks on. If you're taking a photo at your desk, you may have to stack a few books on it, and place the sock-tripod on top of those.
How to light a candle without a lighter or a match
If you have an electric cooking plate, you can use that to ignite some paper napkins. Beware though, a single napkin will be gone in a flash, so you should use more in a bundle.Source: Own experience, where I left a single ply napkin on the cooking plate and accidentally brushed the switch to ON. After a while I smelled smoke, turned to the oven but couldn't see the napkin. I became intrigued and placed another one to the same spot, only to see it rise in the air and ignite mid-air in a flash of flame. I haven't tried that since then, of course.
How to determine if US paper money is genuine?
I recently looked up a similar question myself and I can across a way to make your own counterfeit money pen (if it goes one colour it's real, the other other colour it is fake type thing).What you need:An invisible ink pen (you can get a highlighter and rinse it out so there is not colour left in the reservoir or in the nib)A syringe (can be obtained online if you don't have any lying around)Iodine (which is an antiseptic so it can be easily obtained from any drug store / pharmacy)What you'll need to do:Make sure the felt tip marker is free from any inkTake 2-3ml of the iodine into the syringe (this may take a little while)Inject the iodine directly into the tip of the marker or highlighter until it starts to ooze outWait for it to get absorbed by the marker and then repeat a couple of timesAnd there you have it, you can get a bank note and try marking it - if it comes out yellow/amber/brown, it's genuine, if it marks the note black, it's a dud.  See image below (the small crosses are the pen marks)Please note that iodine does stain so only make a small mark on your note as to not completely ruin it!Here are more detailed instructions from where I found the idea before!
What is the best way to recondition a whiteboard?
I have been very successful at reconditioning white boards by following these steps. Wipe off the board of existing marks using the conventional felt eraser.If there is any tape or sticker residue on the board or around the edges use an orange oil material such as Goo-Gone to remove it.Use isopropyl alcohol to clean the board. For a badly gummed up board this will take some serious elbow work. I have cleaned with paper towels or cotton cloth. Both seem to work equally well.Let the cleaned board dry out completely.Apply a generous layer of carnauba wax based auto finish to the white board. I have applied it using the small pad that comes in the car wax package but a cotton cloth can be used as well. Let the wax dry for several days. It will look all yellowish color, particularly if it was put in extra thick.Use a terry cloth towel to rub off all the excess dried wax. This also requires some elbow grease and you want to really rub and buff the surface of the white board. If properly buffed out the board will be very smooth with none of the yellowish wax residue left anyplace on the board. I have re-conditioned my white board in the office twice in the nine years that I've had it and it still works nearly as good as a new one.
How can I make sure I get the USB plug in the right way up?
Do it correctly one time and then put a bright sticker or a sequin on the side that faves up / towards you.This way you'll be able to know which side is top and put it in accordingly! If you're putting it in in the dark, a sequin or something with more body to it would make you able to feel the correct side. They've recently developed a new usb socket which can go in either way just for your interest!
How do I ensure my car wheels are straight when parking before getting out?
Simple one here as its getting to the end of the day:Drive forward or back a little, if your car veers off in one direction or the other you'll know you need to turn the wheels and as a bonus you'll know in which direction to turn them!As I said this is pretty simple and won't require any modifications to the car which I think is a bonus!
How can I make sure I get the USB plug in the right way up?
If you have visual access, just look at the plug end, and note which side has a block of plastic filling it, and then orient the plug so that this side is going into the side of the socket that has a wide space. If you can't see the socket, it's usually oriented with the space on the bottom. If you can't see the plug, you can often feel the end and determine the orientation.Interestingly, the newer USB 3.0 sockets are fairly easy to determine the orientation of by touch, being similar to the plugs. The older style are harder for me, personally, but it's probably easier for someone with smaller, more sensitive fingertips.
How to make small shoes fit bigger feet
The best hack for this is to use heat because heat makes things expand. All you will need is a hairdryer, a thick pair of socks (or two thinner pairs of socks), and your shoes. Put the socks on and then put the shoes on. Now, put the hairdryer on the highest heat. Blow dry the areas where the shoe needs to expand (usually the toe and maybe the sides). Bend and flex your feet while you are blow drying. You usually have to do this for 20-30 minutes per shoe. Make sure to hold the hairdryer at least 2 inches (5 cm) away from the shoe to avoid damage.
How can I make sure I get the USB plug in the right way up?
All you have to do is follow the USB convention!Every USB plug has (or is supposed to have) one side labeled with the USB symbol.  The pins should be exposed towards the side that is labeled with the USB symbol.  See below for an example:On computers and chargers that have horizontal USB ports, the convention generally has the ports oriented such that, when a USB cable is installed, the USB symbol would point upwards.  For computers and devices that have vertical USB ports, the USB symbol would point leftward as viewed from the front of the device (or, if you rotated device 90 degrees clockwise as viewed from the front, the USB symbol would point upwards).  Some devices may be opposite this, depending on the device's "preferred" horizontal orientation (for example, a PC tower that can lay flat may need to be rotated either CW or CCW, and the USB port orientation should be set based on that horizontal orientation).As some of the comments have pointed out, this is not always followed by all manufacturers.  But it is in the USB specification.  Referring to the USB 2.0 spec:6.5.1: The USB Icon is embossed, in a recessed area, on the topside of the USB plug. This provides easy user recognition and facilitates alignment during the mating process. The USB Icon and Manufacturer’s logo should not project beyond the overmold surface. The USB Icon is required, while the Manufacturer’s logo is recommended, for both Series “A” and “B” plug assemblies. The USB Icon is also located adjacent to each receptacle. Receptacles should be oriented to allow the Icon on the plug to be visible during themating process.
How do I ensure my car wheels are straight when parking before getting out?
If your car is aligned properly, the wheels will be in line with the chassis when the steering wheel is level. But if there's a little play in the wheel (normal), then the easiest way would be to pull in as straight as possible (make a wide turn to get in), and once you're inplace, rock forward and backwards a couple feet, and that will completely straighten your wheels, if you keep your wheel level.If you do this, park with a level wheel, but the front wheels are still not lined up, test your alignment, and possibly get it altered by a professional it it's off.
How to clean a dusty television screen?
First dip a microfiber cloth in water (preferably distilled water so that you don't coat the screen with any impurities), and then squeeze out the excess water.  Then use it to wipe the screen.  The fact that it's damp will result in it picking up all the dust, instead of pushing the dust into the corners.After you've wiped off all the dust, you may have a lot of dried water spots/streaks all over the screen.  Take a dry microfiber cloth and wipe off all the water spots/streaks.  After that, the screen should be free of dust and water spots/streaks.
How to listen to music in the shower?
I've found that the best option to bring any technology in the shower is to use a Ziploc bag. I prefer bigger ones, but sometimes small ones can work. You should squeeze all of the air out of the bag; you can do this by physically squeezing it with your hands or by sucking out the air with your mouth. Ziploc bags are transparent, so you will be able to see the buttons and they will be easier to touch because the bag is airtight. It's also worth noting that Ziploc's, and sandwich bags generally, are weaker around the edges. So, it's always a good idea to double-bag (with the zipper of the outer bag closing over the bottom of the inner bag) to ensure that, should the side of one break, no water gets onto the device.Additionally, making sure there's a bit of air in the inner bag (so it's a bit puffy) is a good idea for a few reasons:It lets you know if the inner baggie isn't airtight / watertight.It allows you to effectively use the touchscreen (on touchscreen devices, otherwise it can be very difficult to tap and swipe effectively), andIt's less likely to muffle the speaker.
How can I dull or darken this zipper with household products?
I would use a black permanent marker such as a sharpie. It takes some time, but I've before drawn over large plastic areas with a sharpie and it keeps an even color for quite some time.Since a marker is a common household item, you can touch-up any scratches in the coating as they appear.
How can I "wear in" my shoes without wearing them?
The best hack for this is to use heat because heat makes things expand. All you will need is a hairdryer, a thick pair of socks (or two thinner pairs of socks), and your shoes. Put the socks on and then put the shoes on. Now, put the hairdryer on the highest heat. Blow dry the areas where the shoe needs to form to fit your foot (usually the toe and maybe the sides). Bend and flex your feet while you are blow drying. You usually have to do this for 20-30 minutes per shoe. Make sure to hold the hairdryer at least 2 inches (5 cm) away from the shoe to avoid damage.This question is being closed as a dupe, and this was my answer on it (slightly modified)
How to clean a dusty television screen?
In that situation, I usually turn off the TV, unplug it from the wall, and then use a Swiffer duster. http://www.swiffer.com/products/swiffer-dustersAny dust that's left is removed with a dampened-then-squeezed-dry microfiber cloth.
How to open a frozen car door?
A bottle of a solution of vinegar and distilled water, which either has a pouring spout or a spray spout, is in my car for just such an occasion. The night before an expected cold spell, I would pour/spray some of the solution in the keyhole so as to prevent water getting in there and freezing. (I hope that explains it well enough for you, Mooseman.)
How can I remove streaks on my windshield from the wipers?
Clean the wiper blades with a soft cloth. If that does not help, they may be worn out so  you may have to consider replacing your wiper blades with new ones. 
How can I remove streaks on my windshield from the wipers?
There are several possibilities that can lead to streaks from the wipers:Worn out wipers: replace themDirt particles or leaves: clean the wipersWax polish on the screen: clean the screen with an alcohol-based cleanerOil remnants from dust on the roads: clean the screen with an alcohol-based cleaner or with gasoline (explosive, be careful!)For cleaning the screen or the wipers we always keep a spray bottle of household glass cleaner in the back of our car.Sometimes even worn out wipers can be resurrected for a limited time until they can be replaced. This can be done by wiping the blades with your thumb. This will not only remove dirt particles but it will also somewhat "sharpen" the rubber plates from our skin.
How do I ensure my car wheels are straight when parking before getting out?
To begin with, most car wheels are centered when the steering wheel is straight. If you have a three spoke steering wheel for example, one of the three should be pointing down.Now, as you turn your wheel, this "position" might occur again after one evolution, but the steering wheels usually only turn about 1.75 times in each direction, so that "position will only occur 3 times (try in your car to be sure...). So if you turn your steering wheel all the way to the left, and then back until the spoke is pointing down, and then one more evolution, your wheels should be centered. If for some reason your steering wheel happens to be not this way, you can also try to turn it all the way to the left, then all the way to the right, and remember how many evolution you had, and turn half of that amount back (e.g. you turn it 3.5 times from full left to full right, and then 1.75 times back to center the wheels). By the way, when parking on hills you might want to turn your wheels purposely as a kind of hand brake. If you turn your wheels, so that if the car would start rolling downhill (for what ever reason), the front wheels would hit the curb, you can assure that it won't roll away, even if your handbrake fails or is not working. 
How to quickly cure hiccups
My solution is taking a big breath, quickly, fixing your pose: straight back and head. After that calm down as much as you can. You are non-existent. Breath in and out, slowly in the same rythm. You are in total controll of your body. After 5-10 seconds my hiccups are gone and I'm relaxed.
How to listen to music in the shower?
So I cam across a solution but it does require sort of completely destroying your existing speakers which may or may not be desirable...What you will need:A watertight plastic containerA drill / something to cut into the plastic containerGlue (something like hot glue or epoxy)Screwdriver SandpaperWhat to do:Start by dismantling your existing speakers (remove entire outer casing so all that's left is the speaker and all electrical innards) the buttons should stay in tact but just be dangling around.Get the speaker and place it face down onto your plastic container and draw around the circumference of the speaker cone.Cut around said drawn circle (repeat 2 & 3 for the buttons)Place all electrical innards inside the box through the speaker hole (which should be just too small to allow the speaker cone all the way through) and apply a small amount of glue around the edge of the speaker cone allowing it to be fixed into place.An option at this point could be to get a small plastic bag to sort of line the inside of the box just to add an extra layer of waterproofing.Glue buttons in place where you've cut holes for them and fix small sheets of plastic (cling film) over them in order to add more waterproofing to these parts and allows them to still be usable.Allow glue to set and Bob's your Uncle (hopefully).
How can I dull or darken this zipper with household products?
You could apply a layer of black shoe polish to the zip, being careful not to get any on the fabric around it.This may not be a particularly permanent solution but after a few coats I imagine it would begin to darken.
How to listen to music in the shower?
I can just add a detail to michaelpri's answer of using a Ziploc bag. This may be safer to use outside the shower without direct water influence but best is you test it with toilet paper, for example, or just something that is easy determined if it's got wet or not. Pinch little tiny holes into the plastic bag with a small needle. Place the speaker membrane right behind those little holes and they hopefully will help the sound waves get through the plastic easier but will prevent water from getting inside the Ziploc bag. I've not tested this, so as I said, you may want to test this with something different than your speaker and also test it in a dry place to determine if tiny holes even help the airwaves get further and be less muffled (please tell me, I'm curious about it!).A different solution without even taking your speaker into the shower would be placing it preferably in a sink next to the shower. As explained in various answers of this question a bowl (in this case we use the sink) amplifies your speakers and makes it easier for the sound waves to get into the shower. If you're worried about the high humidity you could place something over the electronics, best would be some kind of plastic. Water steam is usually hotter than the air in the bathroom so it will fill the room from top to bottom.I personally just place my phone in my sink next to the shower. I don't protect it in any way since splashes don't get that far and if you're phone didn't break when using in rain it sure won't break when taking some splashes from the shower. Although you're right about high humidity potentially causing defects to your device it sure depends on the size of the bathroom, the temperature of the water (thus the production rate of steam) and the time you shower to fill the whole bathroom with steamy hot air.Something else just popped into my mind - It will probably make it harder to press buttons on the speaker, but it is possible to achieve with a transparent fabric: Build your own speaker-tipi! These tents, mostly used by Indians, are designed to let smoke out and no rain in. The wooden poles alone already prevent the interior from getting wet by letting rain drops follow the poles all the way to the ground. You can still add a Rain Cap or Ozan to make sure the interior stays 100% dry.Depending on the size of your speaker I would recommend using toothpicks or wooden skewers as poles and some kind of plastic foil or any other water-repellent material as canvas. This solution includes some tinkering but it sure is a creative one which can add a nice Indian touch to your shower.
How can I make sure I get the USB plug in the right way up?
This may seem like a super simple hack: why don't you get a USB extension cord? This way your connector won't wear out from repeatedly switching the USB device and you can have the "female" part of the cord in a more convenient location then the back of your computer.
How can I remove streaks on my windshield from the wipers?
Windshield wipers need to be replaced about once a year, and the streaking you're experiencing in rainy weather is almost certainly due to worn out wipers.If you have replaced them recently, or you cannot replace them soon, examine them and clean them.  They need to be able to flex, and the wiper blade edge needs to be continuous with no cracks or missing pieces. Clean them to remove any dirt, particularly in the areas that would prevent the blade from flexing and moving, and dry them with a soft cloth.  Then spend some time cleaning your windshield so the wipers don't have to work so hard running over insect leftovers and other windshield debris that might be stuck in place.Lastly, you can try RainX or a similar product.  These cause the windshield to be hydrophobic, which forces water to bead up and fall off the windshield more quickly.  You'll improve your visibility, and even worn out wipers will be able to clear the windshield more effectively.Replacing the wipers, however, is the best solution.
How to find a hole in a bicycle tire tube quickly
One of the tricks I've heard of is filling the inner tube with air and submerging it in water. If you're having trouble finding the leak, then the air isn't escaping too quickly for you to be able to detect it underwater.
How to find a hole in a bicycle tire tube quickly
Take a bucket full of water (the bigger the diameter is, the better) and push your inflated inner tube into the water - section for section. As long as the hole isn't like really, really tiny, you will see some bubbles right away. With tiny holes you need some steady hands, more time and a good pair of eyes. Small bubbles are hard to spot.For easiest bubble-spotting, use a dark bucket, because you will see the bubbles better if the background is dark.Just make sure to dry the area around the hole thoroughly before applying any kind of fix to it.There is also an improvement to the run-the-finger-along-tube-method you already know: Instead of moving your finger along the tube, move the tube along your lips - not really touching them, of course. The area around our lips and tip of the nose is extremely sensitive to airflows.
How to keep dust-free when digitizing photos
If you have a turntable and/or vinyl record collection, you may already own a record brush:The bristles are specially designed to remove dust from the surface, not just brush it off to the side. 
How to remove creases from my shirts without ironing?
If you wash the shirt and hang it up on a proper hanger immediately after it comes out of the washing machine, make sure it is hung in a warm environment (airing cupboard) and once it is dried it will be relatively crease free so long as you hung it up straight and properly without anything touching it!Also, if you tumble dry your shirts, attempt to iron it immediately after getting it out (if it is still slightly wet then even better) as this will make the creases much easier to get out and you won't have to work as hard for the desired result.Other than that I can't really think of any way to 'iron' it quickly after leaving it in the back of a closet for ages... I suppose you could obtain a large flat sheet of metal / wood (preferably two) and then lay the shirt out very flat on the floor (one of the sheets) and place the other sheet on top of it and walk over it, heating up the sheet as well may increase your success here but you'll probably end up having to wash it again anyway!
How to find a hole in a bicycle tire tube quickly
Use soapy water if you don't have where to submerge the tire:Take soap and some water and make soapy water solution (liquid soap dissolves faster)Start to apply soapy water on the tire with your handWhen you put soapy water on the hole you will see soap bubbles appearing. At the same time you can feel the air flow with your hand. Wet hand becomes more sensitive to air flows.I have seen some children using this method on to find a hole on a football or basketball ball, and it will surely work for tires.
How to remove creases from my shirts without ironing?
How much time do you have? I can save you a lot of effort...Take your shirt and thoroughly wet it in the sink/tub.Wring/squeeze all the water out of it that you can.Toss it in the dryer with a (clean, dry) towel or two.Dry for 10-20 minutes, depending on material.Put your shirt on.Just throwing it in the dryer works somewhat, but wetting it down works better. Unfortunately, this makes it take a while to dry. Adding a couple towels to the load will help draw the moisture out faster. I think that's due to having more dry surface area to wick water into, along with helping the tumble action (a single shirt doesn't tumble as well). Whether that's the reason or not, it significantly speeds up drying time for (very) small loads.I've done this a few times. With lightweight dress shirts, it's very quick. For heavier winter-weight shirts, it may take a little longer, but it's much easier than ironing. This especially helps if you're running late and need to shower or do other things, since you can do those while it's drying.This obviously won't put nice ironing creases into your shirt, but it will get rid of unwanted wrinkles.
How to quickly cure hiccups
My technique runs along similar lines to Francis Davey's, but it doesn't require an audience.I say, out loud: "I don't have hiccups. I had hiccups up until just now, but they've stopped, and I don't have hiccups anymore." Or something like that. You have to insist on it.I think this works better if you then focus your mind on something other than hiccups. The critical element is the psychological fake-out, though—we all know from experience that simply thinking about something else isn't going to help.This method works very reliably for me, and it worked for the friend who taught it to me, but since it relies on psychological trickery I don't know for sure whether it will work for everyone.
What can be used besides rice to keep moisture out of salt?
I don't know if the mechanism (for either rice or anything else) is actually a desiccant or mechanical action for breaking the clumps after they form, but I have seen movie theaters (where they are obviously in abundant supply) using popcorn kernels for this purpose.
How to remove creases from my shirts without ironing?
Take it to the cleaner.  They can do an "Iron-only" service where they don't wash it, just iron it.  It's cheap and fast and good. 
What is the best way to recondition a whiteboard?
From personal experience maintaining whiteboards at a university, strong cleaners like simple green and the like are not your friend. They may clean it initially, but tend to leave a detergent behind that alters the property of the boards. Water and a microfiber towel are the only things I'll use on a board. Once they are abraded, there is not much 'conditioning' to be done. The markers require a smooth, hydrophobic surface to function as intended. Detergents work against this.
How to remove creases from my shirts without ironing?
Take a damp (clean) towel and put it in the dryer with the wrinkled shirt and dry it on low to medium heat for 10 minutes. The moisture and heat will relax the fibers in the shirt and take out the majority of the wrinkles. The towel will prevent the shirt from getting too hot and burning.After you take the shirt out, put it on immediately, or hang it up to prevent it from wrinkling again.
How to remove rust from tools
3-in-one oil is great for unsticking rusted tools. Unlike WD-40, it is actually a lubricant so it won't dry up. WD-40 is neither a lubricant or a penetrating oil.Pour a tiny bit into the joint of your pliers and slowly work them back and forth until they become loose again. To remove the surface rust, apply some of the oil to a steel wool pad and rub on the rusty parts until clean. This oil will help "kill" off the rust and prevent it from rusting in the future.
How to find a hole in a bicycle tire tube quickly
You may need to use water, as others have said, but before you do that....Get the tube and partially inflate itHold the tube to your ear and slowly rotate itWhen you hear the air hissing out, you have found the hole.Not only is this quicker than water, it also works out on the road (as there never seems to be a bucket of water around when you need it).
How to find a hole in a bicycle tire tube quickly
In the absence of a bucket with soapy water (eg. on the go), I usually use my tongue.If you don't mind the taste of the rubber, it works even better than using your lips. The saliva on your tongue will create a seal against the hole and gently squeezing air out of the tube will 'burp' or 'fart' against your tongue.This is very helpful with tiny holes because it's not the size of the hole you are detecting, it is the amount of air that is trapped beneath your tongue before it escapes. You regulate this with air pressure in the tube and tongue pressure on the tube, so take your time and allow the air to build up momentarily before it escapes from beneath your tongue.To be clear, I'm not talking about licking the tube! Lightly press the tip of your tongue against the tube and run the tube against your tongue. When you think you have found the hole then you can press a bit more firmly with the tip of your tongue to seal the hole and verify it's location.Personally, it works so well I don't bother with soapy water. Also, if it's not an emergency, I don't patch tubes anyway.
How to find a hole in a bicycle tire tube quickly
I like to hook up something in generally. If you have found the leakage, while on the go, saliva works almost as good as leakage-search-spray which is nothing else as soap-water. You can now double check it and check it again to ensure your patch is close. It works very good for the valve also (in addition for car-tires valves also...)
How to find a hole in a bicycle tire tube quickly
The quickest overall method is this: Pull the tube from the tire and pump it up well above the volume it would be inside the tire. Then (in a quiet place) rotate the tube past your ear. You will almost certainly be able to find the general location of the leak by hearing the hiss, then explore more closely with your finger, keeping your ear close to the suspected area. You will probably hear a noise as your finger blocks and then unblocks the hole. Lips are also good for detecting the stream of air, as Alex pointed out.Bonus technique: when you remount a tire, move the valve stem so that it is near the tire label. When you get your next flat, find the hole in the inner tube, and then find the corresponding location on the tire itself and explore it for thorns, nails, glass or other puncture-causing objects. If you don't do this, there may still be a sharp object imbeded in your tire and you will quickly get another flat.    
How to find a hole in a bicycle tire tube quickly
For finding leaks in tires of any sort, I like to keep a spray bottle of soap water handy. Just spray the tube, and it will bubble wherever the hole is.
How to remove creases from my shirts without ironing?
One option is to use a steamer. It won't get your shirt as perfect as ironing, but if your shirt has a few wrinkles in it, then steaming it a bit before you put it on will help a lot. There is a certain technique to using a steamer - it involves kind of brushing the shirt downward as you steam the shirt. If your shirt is ironed well enough, you can wear it once or twice, steam the wrinkles away, wear it again, steam, and maybe wear it again before you should probably wash it anyway. 
What can be used besides rice to keep moisture out of salt?
You can use coffee beans instead of rice grains, it works the same but they are bigger.And no, it won't pick up the coffee flavor. It's a very common thing in Argentinean restaurants. I've never felt, after using salt from the table, that my food tastes like coffee.
Hiding or covering annoying LED lights on computer and accessories
Something I found out the hard way is that a layer of super glue significantly dims the brightness of the LEDs. While it won't remove the light completely, it will dim it a lot, and you could apply tape (duct or electrical tape would work the best) to completely eliminate the rest of the light.Bear in mind that super gluing will be permanent and it will not easily come off again (possible question for life hack) so while it is a good solution it won't really be reversible.To be honest I would have thought a layer of duct tape (a couple layers of electrical tape) would be plenty to block out all the light but I guess it depends on the shape and everything.Another method I've thought of which I have very high hopes for is Blue Tac or any other mouldable adhesive putty. You would easily be able to press this over the light and mould it so that it covers the entire LED, make the layer thick enough so that all the light will be blocked out and you'll be laughing.So to recap:Superglue for dimming significantlyDuct or electrical tape - for good light blockingBlue Tac for a non permanent solution that can mould to any LED shape.(A further advantage is that if the LED is in a sort of hole, Blue Tac will easily fill in that hole and cover the LED completely)Note: Do not cover any vents or such things as this will lead to your device overheating and eventual death.

How to remove creases from my shirts without ironing?
Since everyone rely on having a dryer (which I don't have) I'll suggest a different solution.You can carefully fold the shirt and sit on it, your body temperature will do the rest. You have to wait a while though... I used to do this before going out: we met at my place, dine and then leave. While dining the shirt was on the chair I was sitting on. It will not remove completely the wrinkles but helps a lot.You can improve using something flat (but still needs to transfer heat) to put over the shirt to avoid to wrinkle the shirt yourself.  Pro Tip: try not to fart.

I experienced the same problem, I would just take my scarf, wrap it once around it, so when I sit on it I won't lose it but I could take it away easily, and then use the rest as u cushion.It's not the best solution, but it was the easiest for me. 
How to keep a desktop computer cooled down
Be aware that only having some case fans would not automatically guarantee a good air flow.Direction, m³/min and such things can vastly influence the effective airflow in a computer case. Also opening of a case can destroy a good airflow.You can try to visualize your airflow using the smoke of a cigarette:Open the case if it has no window.Put transparent plastic foil instead of the opened side to be ableto see the smoke.Hold the burning cigarette outside of one of the fans that blow airINTO the caseExamples of bad fan configuration would be: All fans blowing into the caseAll fans sucking air out of the caseMuch more m³/min airflow into the case than outward
How to remove creases from my shirts without ironing?
Unfortunately I can`t comment on an answer. I have 2 working tips. Hang the shirt on a wire hanger in your steamy bathroom, after you took a shower/bath. The moist air together with gravitation will eliminate a lot of wringles. The secon tip was one of my gfs grandfather. He used this method for his suit back when he was young. Place the shirt carefully as you want it under your fitted sheet (best the ones you can hook over your mattress) and sleep on it. Its like the method Narmer posted in his answer but you get an more heat/contact than just sitting on it.Perhaps place a second sheet or some other cloth over it, if you have concernes for the hygiene :)

How to remove creases from my shirts without ironing?
Some folks have suggested hanging it while you take a shower, or throwing it in the dryer. The best this will accomplish is to trade big creases for small creases. It's also time consuming. And they generally won't do any good for really deep creases. If you need to wear a dress shirt to look nice, I think you'll still fall short of your goal this way. Plus, dryers can be hard on clothes. They'll shrink more, increase brittleness, cause more abrasion leading to holes and piling, and just generally shorten the life of the clothing. You'll have to buy dress shirts a bit more often than you would've otherwise.A steamer can help, but then you might as well just iron, as you'll probably use its steam function when you do. And an iron will let you make creases where you might want them, such as down the sleeve, or to help the collar stay down. If you're not going to iron, there are really only two options. Either cover the shirt with a sweater, so only the collar and maybe cuffs are showing, as one commenter suggested. Or, let your shirts hang freely without getting crunched by all the other clothes. Over time, gravity will pull those wrinkles out. It will take a long time, but if you don't wear the shirts very often to begin with, that shouldn't matter. 
How to improve tv reception at home?
Correctly orienting a directional antenna is important. Try also positioning the antenna at a higher altitude and near a window.If you have access to an attic, and you are willing to buy a long coaxial cable (A "quad-shield" cable is best for preventing signal loss), place the antenna there. Because a roof is both thinner than walls and lacking of wiring, and because of the higher altitude, you will receive a stronger signal.Some channels are simply impossible to receive either because of the effective radiated power vs. distance and various sources of interference.
How to improve tv reception at home?
An old fashioned trick with no need of repositioning the antenna is: Wrap with aluminum foil.Wrap every antenna (or sticking out piece of metal) with it. You may even want to try using a bigger piece of aluminum foil to actually extend the antenna.
Hiding or covering annoying LED lights on computer and accessories
I know these two tricks - one of them to cover any light, and the other to turn off the motherboard lights, specifically. Nail PolishYes, nail polish.  Just grab one with a dark color (black, deep blue, or alike), and put a little over the LED...  That will probably dim the light a bit, but if you keep adding layers over layers of nail polish, you can completely turn it off after 3-4 polish applications.  The good thing about it is that is super easy to apply, it dries out really quick, and you can remove it later using nail polish remover. Motherboard's BIOS settingsIf you are lucky, there might be an option in your motherboard's BIOS settings to turn off the LEDs.  I know it depends on the manufacturer to put those options in there, but I think it's worth a shot to check the settings and find out.  Some examples out there: How do I remove/stop an LED on the motherboard?, New motherboard, led lights always on, Turning off the onboard LEDs.
How to remove creases from my shirts without ironing?
I'm always a little reluctant to goo with a dedicated product as a lifehack, but in this case, my normal concern there doesn't seem to apply.*You really, really should try Downy Wrinkle Releaser.I've had your exact situation forever, and for any shity that doesn't actually need to have visible pressed creases, it's roughly as effective and much faster than most other methods.You literally just spray it on wrinkled clothes, (or a creased area,) flatten the damp part with your hands, and the wrinkles come out.  So it's much faster than:Heating up and possibly filling an iron, etc. Dampening clothes and using the dryer (which is still better if you have a bunch of slightly wrinkled items).Steaming (machine or shower)And you can travel with it for hotel use, etc.Negatives:It has a pretty strong floral smell.  I don't mind it, and it gets milder after a bit, but the initial scent is hard to miss.I wouldn't use it on anything really delicate, like silk, but most other possible solutions have issues there too.It's not quite as effective on wool as it is on cotton, but I still find it better for sweaters than ironing most of the time*_ Normally, when there's a dedicated product for a task, it's not a great lifehacks answer, but that's usually a function of it being the one everyone knows, but is either not not available to the OP, or not appropriate for some specific reason.  That doesn't appear to be the case here, and no one has mentioned it, and I've found it MUCH easier than the traditional methods for the case described.

Typical problem in boom headset
Everyone at my work has headphones like this.  They have a simple solution: wear them one ear at a time, and switch ears every 20-30 minutes.  I'd also recommend listening to it with both ears until you just start to get uncomfortable, then go one ear at a time until you cool down.  I know it's probably not exactly what you're looking for, but it works pretty well.  
How to remove creases from my shirts without ironing?
I'm generally a big proponent of dryroning™, especially for slacks. I don't like to wash (let alone dry-clean) things over and over that just aren't dirty. But in many cases like this I think you will find that breaking out the iron and spot ironing those wrinkles is actually much faster and more effective than the alternatives. Always be wary of solutions that are more trouble than the original problem.  But here's the official dryroning approach: 1) with a spray bottle, spray a little water on the more stubborn creases2) throw a pretty wet hand towel into the dryer with your shirt. Add a dryer sheet to freshen up that shirt you've apparently abandoned in your closet for months. 3) Set the dryer to a low setting and tumble til dry. Remove promptly. Pro tip: "it is full of creases because you stuffed it all the way in the back of your closet" Don't do that and you won't have this problem in the first place. Prevention is the best cure. :) 
How to find a hole in a bicycle tire tube quickly
At home, I use the bucket method. However, "in the field" I don't carry a bucket with me when I cycle. Finding the source of the puncture can be critical, whether one is patching the tube or using a replacement.I first chalk the tire at the value stem, and mark the rotation direction on the tube. This allows me to "align" the punctured tube with the tire.After removing the wheel, and separating the tire from the tube, I inflate the tube and both listen and feel for a leak. Sometimes I hear it. Other times I feel the escaping air on my face or eye. Once I know where the puncture is on the tube, I can align it to the tire, and find the place on the tire where the puncture occurred. There may still be debris in the tire that I need to remove such as metal, glass, nails, and even a wood splinter once.

Make sure you've got a clear line of sight to the transmitter antenna.  Anything between your antenna and the transmitter will make the signal worse; obstructions containing water (eg. trees) or metal (eg. mesh-reinforced plaster or stucco) are especially bad.Obstructions near the line of sight usually make things worse, but can occasionally have the paradoxical effect of improving the signal.If there are any buildings nearby with large metal surfaces, try pointing the antenna at them.  Occasionally you can catch a reflection that's stronger than the direct-line signal.
How to determine if US paper money is genuine?
The list of publicly known US Currency security features can be found here.Essentially, they are:  - Each bill has a watermark featuring the same historical figure as the main portrait.- Use of Color-Shifting Ink on the face in the lower-left corner- Various Fine-Line printing patterns- Polyester security thread running through paperThe brand-new (late 2013) bills have completely new designs and sets of security features that can be found here.  They are numerous and vary by denomination, so I'll leave them as an exercise for the reader.If you don't wish to memorize these attributes, you can get an actual 'counterfeit detection pen' for under $5 here.  They likely don't work any better than the hacked-one in the currently accepted answer, but I doubt you could re-create one for less.
Substitute for a tablet stylus
Aluminum foil works similarly to a stylus. I've successfully created a stylus by wrapping several (~7) layers of aluminum foil over the eraser end of a pencil. Note that the contact points will not be as smooth as with a good stylus (e.g., lines drawn may be dashed) and if the foil rips it may scratch the screen, so be cautious.

Hiding or covering annoying LED lights on computer and accessories
Easiest way to "block" the lights is to disable them. Just cut one of the wires leading away from each LED (keep reading).  Unless one has plans to get real fancy later on, it doesn't matter which one; just one leading away from each LED>  Some wires are connected to the motherboard in a way they can be pulled and put back using a sharp nosed pliers... no cutting needed and one can put it back later. Secure each loose end separately.  One can use black electrical tape or a very small wire nut.  If it was a pulled connector, secure exposed metal with electrical tape.There are variations that depend on one's skill/knowledge of electricity.  All things equal, no fancy plans in the future (but wanting to leave options open) and assuming lower skill, I would say the best place to cut is half-way between the longer wire.                                                 ________________                   ______________________________________________D                                             |                                            |                              Cut half way between longer wire.This is just a judgement call and conditions may dictate otherwise.  There are pros and cons with where to cut. People will comment below on considerations and alternatives to this and other points.A good idea for the future, (maybe you want to sell it one day and the buyer wants pretty lights), is to label each wire.  An easy way to label is cut a strip of paper slightly narrower than scotch tape, write down whatever, place it on tape a little larger on all sides and extending on the ends, and then fold over the wire:                    Wire                     ||        _____________||_____________Tape   |               LED Wire A1  |  (Text is written on thin piece of paper and stuck       |____________________________|   on tape. Tape shown sticky side shown down.)                     ||                     ||    Fold tape over wire, sticking to itself.Of course, unplug everything first.Disclaimer: Electricity can kill you.  Unplug everything first.  Take to a licensed repair shop already opened up with wires identified, and let them cut the wires.  A nice repair shop will do it for next to nothing. And by "next to nothing", if it only takes them a minute, I would estimate the cost to be about $0.00. At that price, insist on a $5 tip. (But depending on where you take it and the culture, they could charge more, of course.  I wouldn't.)
Substitute for a tablet stylus
Using Aluminum foil has already been mentioned by Mooseman. Since there are different ways of crafting your own stylus, I'd like to expand on this a bit.The following method found on CNET uses aluminum foil as well but also includes a Q-tip to accomplish a screen gentle meeting place:Here's what you'll need:A cotton swab (aka "Q-tip") Aluminum foil Scissors Tape A pen Steps:Remove the ink from the pen. Cut the cotton swab at a sharp angle and insert it into the mouth of the pen. Secure with tape.Wrap the foil around the neck of the pen, a couple of centimeters above the tip of the cotton swab. Wrap tightly, and secure with tape at the top. Moisten the cotton swab with a drop of water. (No, this will not harm your tablet's or phone's screen.)This is what the process should look like:Another method found on lifehacker uses conductive foam instead of aluminum foil. Here's a video in case you don't like reading instructions.What you'll need:A small piece of conductive foam (the kind that microchips and other small electronic parts come embedded in)Scissors A not insulated wire or a wire stripper to remove insulation more than twice the length of your penTapeA penSteps:Remove the ink from the pen.Disassemble the rear of the pen so that you get a tube. If you can't easily achieve this, you may want to use a different pen or try to break the rear off.Cut a small stripe off of the conductive foam so it's a little bit wider than the tip of the pen.Wrap the wire around the foam multiple times at about one-third of the stripe.Stuff the piece of conductive foam into the tip of the pen, making sure that some of the foam sticks out of the pen and the wire sticks out of the rear of the pen.Wrap the excess wire around the pen in a spiral course (in direction of the tip).Fix it in position with tape so that you're touching the wire with your skin while holding the pen normally.Trim the sticking out foam so that it has a more round shape.This is how it might look like:
Hiding or covering annoying LED lights on computer and accessories
Aluminum foil, works nicely on the outside. It blocks the light completely and can be molded around leds that stick out. Use regular tape (like scotch tape) for easy removal, in case you need to check if the appliance is still working properly.You could tidy up by covering the whole (foil + tape) with tape matching the colour of the appliace.Do not use it inside computers (accessories) or where electrical components are bare! Doesnt work so well around small children as the shiny stuff arouses their curiosity and they want to pry it loose. 
How to keep your hands warm in winter while working on a laptop?
According to a recent discussion on body heat loss in the British Medical Journal,As the main channel of convective and radiant heat loss when the body is well insulated, exposure of the head and face can account for a large proportion of body heat loss… The claim that there is nothing special about the head in heat balance ignores the important influence of facial cooling in air on systemic cardiovascular reflex responses and that body temperature can be selectively influenced by cooling of the head and face.You say you are already wrapping yourself in a quilt, so it looks like your body is "well insulated".  Wearing a hat (or better yet, a balaclava) will help warm the exposed parts of your body, including your hands.
How to clean out a peanut butter jar for recycling?
First, fill the jar with warm water and then use your fingers to wipe as much peanut butter as you can off the inside surface.  (Don't spend more than a few seconds on this; it's not necessary to get all the peanut butter off at this point.)Then empty the jar and fill it up a bit more than halfway with hot water and maybe a little dish soap.  Screw the lid onto the jar, hold it securely, and shake it vigorously, turning it once or twice in the process.  Ten or twenty seconds of agitation should very quickly dislodge all the remaining peanut butter.  (In rare cases you may need to repeat the process with fresh hot water.)

That way you can actually keep your hands under the quilt together with the keyboard. :D
How to remove garlic smell from my mouth
I want to add that most of the time the bad breath from garlic is not caused from residue in your mouth but rather from the digestion of the garlic. Sulfur containing compounds from the garlic (and other smelling food) like allicin are broken down in your stomach and liver... and result in sulfur compounds in your body. A lot of these compounds leave the body via breathing and urinating (and as far as I know sweating) in the form of the stable  allyl methyl sulfide, which last a long time in your body. As often known in Arabic/Middle Eastern countries, milk and other milk products help with the smell as well as string taste.Literature:Suarez, F.; Springfield, J.; Furne, J.; Levitt, M. "Differentiation of mouth versus gut as site of origin of odoriferous breath gases after garlic ingestion," Am. J. Physiol. 1999, 276(2 Pt 1), G425–30.Maier, Karyn (5 June 2010).

How can I get food unstuck from my teeth while at work?
Take a sip of water and swish it around in your mouth in the same way you would a fluoride rinse. This will push out most particles.I've used -- although it may not be the best idea -- a bent paperclip. It works essentially the same as a toothpick, but is metal, so it can hurt your gums if you're not careful. Use the bathroom mirror if possible.

If I've had a take-out lunch, upon finishing lunch I'll often have an empty soft drink cup and a straw. I've found that the tip of the straw can often work a bit like floss.The open part of the straw often fits down over my tooth, so I can kind of get it around all sides of the tooth at once.It's no substitute for floss, but it can work in a pinch.

How can I get food unstuck from my teeth while at work?
I use flossing sticks at work, but whenever I run out of those, then I use a pushpin:This is something that can be found in any office environment.  The fact that the end is sharp means it's good for squeezing in between your teeth and digging out pieces of food.  I have a small mirror at my desk and it helps to make sure that I don't prick my gums.  Also, when using the pushpin, try to keep your head tilted downward - that way if you were to drop the pushpin, it won't fall into your mouth.  It would cause serious problems if you accidentally swallowed it.Like David Richerby said, a pushpin could scratch off the enamel from teeth, so only use it if you have nothing better at your disposal.  If you have to use a pushpin, then use it with care and only use it to dig out food that's stuck between your teeth.  Don't start flossing all of your teeth with it.

How to quickly warm up a toilet seat
Three rather simple methods you could use before/instead of sitting down on the cold seat:Preheat the toilet seat by rubbing the ring for a while using your handsAdd some insulation, like covering the ring with toilet paperAvoid sitting on the it, squat over it like they do in some cultures
How to quickly warm up a toilet seat
If you have a minute to spare before sitting, try using a blow dryer, otherwise known as a hair dryer, on it. That should work pretty well, but only if you aren't dancing from holding it in. A prevention method, and not really a hack, is to buy either a heated seat or one of those cushioned seats which will still be cold but should warm up much faster. 
How to undo a cable tie so that it is reusable
As you can see it the images you've provided, there is usually a small tab that slots into the grooves of the zip tie in order to stop the cable undoing, some of the smaller ones used with electronics can relatively easily be undone by simply pulling either side hard, however, for more heavy duty ones, this is near impossible to do so you'll need to do something else.If you get something small and pointy (a pin or needle but other small objects will work) and put into the block with this tab and try to pull it down with the object you are using and then it should undo very easily!It won't damage the zip tie and it will still be useable and once you've had a couple of goes at it, it'll be very easy for you to do. Some more expensive zip ties have a small button like thing on the block which will undo the zip tie by moving this tab out of the way, so if you use them a lot you could look into investing in something like this.Here is a link to a similar method to the one I have mentioned previously with a slight variation.
How to quickly warm up a toilet seat
I assume both warming up and insulating the toilet seat from the skin will give the same comfort. 1. SocksPlace socks on either side of the toilet seat. This will prevent the direct contact of buttocks with the toilet seat, but there are some risks involved in it as the socks may get germs, so be sure to wash them afterwards.2. Toilet paperFold the toilet paper three or four times and place it on one side of the seat, ensuring that it covers one side of the oval seat. Do the same for other side. 3. Rub with NapkinRub the seat with towel napkin until it warms up to the satisfactory level. 4. Artificial seat made of clothStitch a seat shaped material with some thin layer of insulating material. Have some sets of this. Replace it daily.
How to remove / brighten yellow patches in hair
There's no 'hack' answer I'd suggest, other than the relatively safe but probably, in this case, totally ineffectual application of neat lemon juice left on for a while. I'd advise caution though - sometimes, dyed blond can start to look green when other chemicals are applied (chlorine being the obvious one, but chemical reactions are possible even with lemon juice, so its hard to predict the outcome).If its orangey yellow, it means the product you used is not powerful enough to 'lift' the basic hair colour, or you didn't leave it on long enough. Any hair colour containing peroxide is very efficient at creating blond, but again, the results vary according to how long its been left on;- too short a time and it'll be orangey yellow, too long means the hair will start to degrade, becomes fragile and starts to break. If the product you bought came with something to apply after the colour, that's probably a toner, which is meant to knock out any yellow/orangey tones - if that didn't do the trick, then it's likely nothing is going to.You could, though, try a 'silver' shampoo, such as L'Oreal Professional Silver - its purple when applied, but will brighten dull blond hair and does reduce yellow/orange tones. If that doesn't help, the hair colour needs to be corrected, preferably by a professional.

How do I put protective screens on, without getting air bubbles?
The best would be to use tempered glass screen protector instead, so you won't get much air bubbles. You can also use liquid screen protector which is basically a super ultra-thin silicone dioxide surface coating.Whatever you've one or not, here are few steps how to do it:Use a dust-free environment.For example in the kitchen under extractor/exhaust fan.Wash your hands thoroughly.You may cover your face (e.g. hygienic mask).Clean and dry your screen with thoroughly with the alcohol pad and microfiber cloth before beginning installation to remove any dust, dirt or lint.Use wipes or cleaning cloth to remove the excess dirt. First use the wet one (alcohol based), secondly use the dry one.You can use dust absorption sticker to clean the screen again if it's still not clean enough.Gently peel off the protective layer on the adhesive side, carefully align it correctly with the screen, speaker grill and holes, then lay down the screen protector gracefully and slowly begin the application process starting from one side (slightly pressing the centre) and spread to over all smoothly by pressing on it. This will allow adhesive properties to stick onto your screen.Don't touch the sticky side.Some protective screens have liquid included, so it can be used before applying the screen protector.For squeezing you may use a squeegee card.Finish by using a squeegee card to get rid any additional bubbles.
How to undo a stubborn knot without using fingers
First, get a spoon (preferably wooden). Bang on the knot, this will loosen it up. Now you can do one of two things. I prefer to use a corkscrew, but you can also use tweezers or pliers. For the corkscrew, put the point in between the strings of the knot. Twist and wiggle the corkscrew and eventually the knot will come undone. You can follow a similar procedure for tweezers and pliers.Image from Wikipedia
How to undo a stubborn knot without using fingers
All knots rely on stress between the turns on the rope to stay together. If you are able to release some of the tension so it is easier to untie the knot.Tapping on it can help, and doing something similar to the plastic bag solution can help. That is to twist the ends and push them into the knot to loosen it. Also locating a bend which is movable can help releave tension, and jiggle this around a bit.Finally you can apply pliers or flat screw drivers in some bend to help it loosen from the other parts, but be careful to actually loosen it, and not tightening it.
How to undo a cable tie so that it is reusable
Another option, only available if you can tighten it a little more, is to insert a bit of plastic or paper from the other side and let it slide under the ratchet to hold it up, ready for you to pull the rest out again.

You can always try to roll it the other way around, which will remove some of the curl in the paper when unrolled again.Another option if you don't mind creases in the paper is to make a crease in the direction of the curl. Creases don't curl easily.
What can be used besides rice to keep moisture out of salt?
Sometimes you get little packages of silica gel when you get some new electrical toy tool, I do believe this can be used to keep salt dry. Haven't tried it myself though.
How to undo a stubborn knot without using fingers
Scissors work amazingly. No, I'm serious. If you don't care too much about the knot, just cut it with a pair of scissors.But I would also focus on the bigger picture: biting your nails. I struggled with this as well, and I've found that there are two main situations where I find myself biting my nails: 1. when they're jagged, and 2. when they're too long.Buy yourself two good nail clippers and leave one at home, and carry the other with you. First of all, clip your nails to be as neat as possible, so that you have no jagged edges to tempt you into biting them. When your nail breaks in the middle of the day, instead of biting them (which only makes it worse), use the nail clippers you carry with you to solve it. And finally, get into the habit of clipping your nails often so that you're clipping them instead of biting them.
How to undo a stubborn knot without using fingers
Try soaking the knot in water and then placing it in a microwave.  Make sure there isn't any metal or that it won't give off noxious fumes when heated.  Alternatively try lubing it with some kind of oil and putting it in the freezer.

How can I prevent leaves from blocking my gutter guard?
You can't! But you can try adding some larger grids around the drop outlet which will keep it from clogging up a little longer. This grids can be bought, or made as DIY lifehacks from  large bottles with holes or wire mesh bent into shape.In the long run you do need to keep cleaning the gutter, or trim the tree's overhanging branches.
What is the best way to open clamshell packaging?
You're probably not necessarily looking for the 'best' way to open it, but one that will work when you're in the middle of nowhere, you just purchased an item from a store, and for obvious reasons don't carry scissors with you.Chances are you don't care for the cardboard packaging or imagery (and want to vent your frustration on a bad design). If you're out and about, one thing you are probably always carrying with you is a house key (if you use one of the square ones, you're out of luck).On the flattest, widest part of the surface (double check there's no cables or useful parts underneath or hidden by the cardboard - physically feel it), apply the 'sharp' point of the key and cut up and down (preferably in the centre as a line). You'll have to repeat this process as a key is fairly blunt - but it does mean you will avoid any serious cuts.Once you get a line in (the wider the open line, the easier this will be), place either hand or fingers like you would pull apart two curtains. Apply brute force and pull apart in opposite directions. What will happen is the line will further split and allow you to worm out the item and contents.This might seem inefficient, but cutting a slot and pulling apart is sometimes actually easier than scissors, and it's a neat trick if you're in a remote area.(If you don't have such a shaped key, it might be worth getting one.)
How to see better in the dark
Put your Hands in front of your eyes before going in the dark room , your eyes will adjust much faster because it's darker than in the room. Or maybe try a flashlight with redlight, eyes don't react to red light, so they don't need to adjust, but you can see everything. 
How to see better in the dark
This is why I keep a small flashlight on my nightstand. Alternatively consider installing a small stick on push button light either in the bathroom (near the toilet) or your bedroom to provide just enough light to see what you're doing, or a plugin nightlight or two. If your bathroom has more than one light (and separate switches), like a light for the shower, and the main light, and maybe even a vanity (mirror) light, take some time to experiment with which light is dimmer at night and turn only that light when you go into the bathroom. My bathroom has separate lights for the shower and the main light, and the shower light is much dimmer, so if I don't take my flashlight in the middle of the night I just turn on the shower light. This way I don't ruin my night vision.
How to see better in the dark
I use the light on my phone...and I don't mean the camera flash as a flashlight, I simply mean hit any key on my phone to have the screen light up in response. This often adds enough light in the room so I don't bump my knee or leg on an obstacle, an doesn't become too bright forcing my eyes to adjust and "wake me up more"I have also simply stood for a moment or two in the dark room and tried to focus on an object at the other side of the room. and then focus on an object very close. This distant focusing seems to "warm up" the eyes relatively quickly and allows the organ to let in as much light as possible to try and see the different ranges in the room. 
How to quickly cure hiccups
The surefire, never fail method for me is simply to drink water in small rapid sips without breathing until I need to take a breath. By the time I breathe, the hiccups are gone. Other methods, holding my breath, breathing deeply, etc, always take more than one try.
How to separate plastic grocery bags?
The classic way is to moisten the your index and thumb and then do the rubbing methos, usually with saliva, but of course there's germs because who knows what you've touched while picking up groceries.Another way to get some quick moisture on your finger that does not include your mouth: If you happened to have picked up some items from the refrigerated/frozen section, like cold beverages, a jug of milk, plastic wrapped meats/food, a tub of ice cream, perhaps a six pack of beer, often there will be condensation on the outside of these items. Just swipe your fingers across the item to pick up some moisture and get to bag separation!This seems to be more common in Asian grocery stores, but often at the checkout lanes, I've noticed the cashier and/or baggers have a small container of this stuff:Essentially a waxy substances that you dip your fingers into to get a better grip on stuff- bags, paper, money, whatever.
How can I prevent leaves from blocking my gutter guard?
This looks awesome, but I don't know how easy it would be to DIY. Maybe just a few long pieces of wood? Just an idea.Consumer Reports recommended DIY ones, such as 'CR Best Buy Amerimax 85198 or 854054,' which they say costs less than $100 and is available at Home Depot for $2.50 for a 20' roll.Hope this helps! 
How to see better in the dark

How can I make an improvised vegetable steamer?
It dawned on me as I was writing the question that I have other pans, one of which is a good size; I'll use that.
How can I make an improvised vegetable steamer?
You can use a steaming rack like this:Placed inside the the large pan/pot/wok with water lower than the height of the rack. Then put a heatproof plate or smaller pan (with or without sieve holes) on the steaming rack. Lid the pot/wok and steam way.If you don't have a steaming rack, you can use aluminum foil. Make three small to medium sized balls and squish them slightly flat so that don't roll. put them in your pot in a triangle and add water. Rest your plat/pan of food/veggies for steaming on top.
What is an inexpensive and non-electric way to warm my sheets before getting in them?
You could keep the sheets in your living room, or another room which is warmer than your bedroom, and thusly have warmer sheets when going to bed.Another option, maybe not to hygienic, but could still be useful, would be to enter bed with some clothing to preheat before taking off your clothes. (Maybe best done in the outdoors) My last suggestion would be to use extra blankets over the bed during daytime to keep the sheets underneath slightly warmer.
How To Get Food Out of Braces
Who says you can't brush your teeth at school? Just keep a small travel toothbrush (or brush with travel cap/tube) in your backpack and visit the bathroom after lunch. This was my dentist/orthodontist's recommendation when I had braces 10+ years ago, still a good idea today I think. Alternatively they do sell different sizes and shapes of disposable "brushpick" style tools in the dental aisle of pharmacies/Walmart/Target, and even plain old toothpicks might work. Carry some in a plastic baggie for after lunch at school. This method is probably more time consuming.For a very basic approach, try swishing plain old water vigorously around your mouth then spitting it out, repeating a few times. Probably will not dislodge the most stubborn food particles, but should get rid of the majority of it. 
How To Untangle Headphones
I  get this quite a lot and more often than not I can untangle them with a fair amount of success.  Initially, I grab a random wire among the tangled mess and shake it up and down a few times by this strand of wire, this usually removes the worst of the mess and the rest can easily be picked apart as it normally ends up with just one end of them being a little bit tangled.If you use something like a pen or pencil to pick it apart - it'll have less grip than it does on your fingers so will work out a little bit easier but it all depends on your preferences.
How to listen to music in the shower?
I hate advertising for Sony, but you can get one of these waterproof headphones:http://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/walkman/nwz-w273-nwz-w274sThey're made for people who engage in sports activity and sweat a lot. I use them only in the shower and it works fine.
How to quickly cure headaches without medicine
Cold CompressSoak a small towel in cold water, wrap it around an ice pack, lay down, and hold it on your forehead.Or, depending on the type of headache...Hot CompressSoak a small towel in as-hot-as-possible-but-it-will-not-burn-you water, lay down, and hold it on your forehead.Tension headaches can also be relieved with caffeine (thus why it's various pain relievers). Drinking hot, caffeinated tea will doubly help.
What is the best setting on iPad for reading eBooks
Any backlit screen isn't optimal for reading; an e-ink screen such as that on the Amazon Kindle is preferred. But to answer your question...As to avoid computer vision syndrome, the 20-20-20 rule is very effective. Quoting from this article:The 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, take your eyes off your computer and look at something 20 feet (6 metre) away for at least 20 seconds.I like to use the 204 rule, which is the above, but ALSO using the recommended 20 inches (50 cm) between the monitor/tablet and your eyes.
What office equipment can I use to safely observe a solar eclipse?
A common method that I was taught at school is to create a pinhole projector type thing.You can do this by making a small (pinhole) piercing in a sheet of paper and hold it above the ground until you get a small circle on the floor (which is the 'Sun') and you can safely watch the floor to see the eclipse progress.You can also do it by interlocking your fingers at right-angles and the gaps between your fingers can act as the pinhole in this instance.More information can be found here.
What is the best way of cleaning the glass on a wood burning stove?
Very fine wire wool (1000 grade) is the best way to do this.  Spray the glass with a little water, then rub firmly with the wire wool.This was suggested to me by a stove dealer, and is the only method I've found that removes the thickest layers of burnt-on deposits.
Best method of getting a wine label off a wine bottle?
I fill a large bucket with water and a small amount of bleach (I've never been overly particular about the quantity).  Soak a batch of bottles for a few hours, then, wearing rubber gloves, the labels should just slip off.I've found this approach works for about 80% of beer bottles (used for homebrew).  If the labels don't come off with this method, I dump the bottles as I've found nothing that can get these 20% of labels off efficiently.
How to jump start a car without another car
If your battery is getting old and nearing replacement time, you can use a simple trick (provided you have a wet battery that can be opened from the top) involving just two aspirin tablets which are commonly available and used for treating fever and pains.Pop the hood of your carUnscrew the filler caps for each cellNote that opening a battery is dangerous so only do it if you are comfortable with the risks and know what you are doing. Divide the two tablets into equal amounts to be put in each cell (make sure every hole gets a piece of aspirin)Close up all the filler caps and shut the hoodImmediately start your car, don't stand around admiring the scenery. The car should now have enough juice for one more start.Note: This method can seriously effect the lifetime of the battery, so if it is a new battery and it has simply just run out of charge, avoid using this method. As mentioned this should be used for old and dying batteries so you should head to a garage to get it replaced as soon as possible.
I need to attach two+ pieces of paper without staples, glue, tape, or the like
A simpler variation which has worked well in my world, is to double fold the corner. That is fold first the corner at i.e. 60°, and then afterwards at 30°. The point is not the actual degress, but rather to have double interlocking creases in the corner.
How to jump start a car without another car
Depending on how low your battery is, there is a way to start a car if you have a manual transmission, and that is to push-start the car.Follow this procedure:Set the ignition(/key) to the drive-position, i.e. the normal position it is in when drivingPut the car in 2nd gear, and hit the clutch and hold it Get someone to push/pull the car so that you have a little speed on the carRelease the clutch swiftly, and the car will most likely start If the car is moving too slowly, it will not work, but you don't really need to have a lot of speed either. It can also be done whilst in reverse, but it's a little trickier to steer and handle car then.Please do use 2nd gear and the clutch pushed in. It's a lot harder to start if in 1st gear, or if the car is in gear!I have followed this procedure a lot of times with success, but mainly on slightly old cars.
How to quickly cure headaches without medicine
You've almost given the answer in your question: If you have a starting headache due to little water or food, then your best option is to drink and/or eat. Neither pills nor lifehacks should be used instead of drinking or eating.And then it's another story what to drink or eat if not regular drinks or meals are available, or if the headache comes from other medical situations. But normally, start with drinking and/or eating, and maybe relax and try not stressing.
How to jump start a car without another car
For around $100 (USD) you can buy a battery pack that is able to jump your car. A quick google search for "jump starter battery pack" will show many options and price ranges. They'll often be able to inflate tires, charge phones and other handy utilities too. You clamp it on just like you would a jump start with another car and start, but you might not want to keep them attached too long.I have one that has saved me misery many times, but remember to check the charge frequently as the batteries do drain even when not in use. I fine mine should be charged maybe every two to three months and gets 3 jumps on a battery but YMWV.
How to jump start a car without another car
If you have a charged battery lying around you can jump start a car off that. Attach the jump leads as you would to a battery in another vehicle. You probably won't get many starts off this battery before it goes flat. Of course it would make more sense to put the charged battery in your car, if it fits.
How to quickly cure headaches without medicine
Word of warning: this is an extremely impractical solution.At one of my old jobs we had an Anechoic chamber. The result of being in one of these is that is is extremely quiet and when the lights are off, extremely dark.One of my colleagues used to swear that five minutes sitting in it with the lights off would cure any headache. I can anecdotally confirm.A less extreme/more practical alternative could be keeping your head under a duvet, curtains drawn, earplugs in.
How to jump start a car without another car
Some additional methods:Push-start with nowhere to pushGot a manual transmission you could push-start but nowhere to push it? This works if you're parallel parked or don't have suitable terrain to push-start. You do need sufficient battery charge to power the ECU/coils/injectors though. Jack up one of the drive wheels off the ground, put the car in 4th or 5th gear and the key in the ignition position, and turn the jacked-up wheel by hand to turn over the engine. If turning it by the tire is too hard, a ratcheting socket wrench on the axle nut with a long extension bar can be used instead.Safety notes: Make sure you have the parking brake firmly engaged and also have a secondary method of blocking the non-drive wheels from moving. If using the wrench method, it must be a ratchet or once the engine takes over it will turn your wrench into a projectile!Trickle charge with an electronic device's AC adapterGot a laptop charger or other device with 13-15v output? Hook it up to the battery terminals for a half hour or so and, if the battery is in decent condition, you'll probably get enough charge to start. Not useful without AC outlets nearby though, but I've used this method successfully before at home. It can also be combined with the above method if you don't have sufficient battery charge to power the ignition system.
How to undo a stubborn knot without using fingers
There is a tool made just for your problem.  It's called a 'marlinspike' and is used by sailors to undo knots and bends when they've been drawn too tight.You can find an example here.As others have stated, the best bet is to attempt to add material into the knot/bend.  This facilitates loosening the troubled area.  To explain further, from an end of the work, find the first crossing and, from the side opposite the end, insert the marlinspike (or corkscrew, screwdriver, what-have-you) between the end piece and the crossing (typically, under the crossing piece toward the end.)  This should allow you to make a little extra space in the first crossing's loop and then you can push some material from the end into the knot, thereby creating more slack in the knot / bend.Continue to do this with all the crossings in the knot/bend until satisfied with the result. 
My monitor turns off when fridge starts. How can I stop this?
Put your computer/monitor onto a battery backup. That way, when there is a big (but short) drain on the power, the computer/monitor will be fine. I do this, and find that it is also very convenient during power flickers/blackouts, where I'd otherwise have to stop using the desktop computer.A battery backup doesn't last forever, but it should definitely keep your monitor from cutting out during power drains.

Figure out what outlets are on what circuits. Plug them into different circuits, using an extension cord if needed.You could also use a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) device to protect the monitor from being shut off.
My monitor turns off when fridge starts. How can I stop this?
As other people have noted, using a UPS is a great idea.However, it sounds like your monitor may be particularly sensitive to power fluctuation.  I would recommend, as a test, when you get your UPS home, plug your monitor in to it, and then plug the UPS into itself.  This will make the UPS think that it has good power from the wall.  It will eventually turn off the inverter, going to 'wall' power, just as the 'wall' power (coming from the unit itself) disappears.  If your monitor still goes out before the UPS turns the inverter back on, I'd look for an active battery backup.  Something that runs an inverter all the time and has a separate circuit for charging the battery when AC is present.Oh yeah, I'd probably plug my computer into the solution as well (unless it is a laptop.) ;-)
How to determine how much heating oil is left in the tank?
Pour boiling water down the side of the tank.There will be an obvious line where the heat is transferred away from the metal by the remaining fuel in the tank.  The upper part, where there is no fuel, will dry quickly from the hot water heating the metal of the tank and staying hot.  The lower area, where there is fuel, will remain wet longer, since the metal will be cooled by the fuel.If the visual indicator is not as helpful as you'd like, you can also just feel the metal side of the tank, from the bottom, moving up, looking for the height at which the tank is noticeably warmer.  That will mark the fuel level, as the fuel will cool the metal tank faster than the vapors above will.
How to quickly cure headaches without medicine
Bend over at the waist, let your arms hang loose, tuck your chin in and let the blood rush to your head.  Hold for 10-20 seconds.  Repeat as necessary.

Hydration - water is best, also try sports drink with electrolytesCoffee helps if you are into that.Accupressure/reflexology REALLY WORKS I prefer the hand pressure point.
How can I amplify the speakers of my iPhone?
Similar to @kenorb's answer, but instead you could place your phone in a metal saucepan. I have done this while on holiday and I had forgotten to bring speakers and it works really well. Also tilting the pan on it's side and facing it to where you are sitting or 'boogieing' will make it more directional and louder.
My monitor turns off when fridge starts. How can I stop this?
A cheaper thing to try is a couple of clamp on ferrites on the power cables. They can be obtained from your local electronics store or online. I would start with a couple on both the monitor and refrigerator.
How to jump start a car without another car
You can push-start a manual transmission car alone (with no-one to help you push) if you can push in reverse (using your back) to back the car up onto a slight hill. Not too steep otherwise you will not be able to push it up. Long and almost flat is the best. Even up a moderately steep hill, you can push car up one step at a time by your leg and back muscles.Keeping the driver's door opened, put transmission into first gear, push the clutch down with your right leg, and push car backwards uphill with your left leg through the opened door (assuming steering wheel is on the left side of the car). When you are tired, disengage clutch and car will stop in the middle of the hill. Repeat until you are far enough uphill so that you have chance to develop enough speed downhill.Then, to start, you put the car into neutral, push the car forward a bit, jump in, wait for a bit speed to develop using gravity, and put it into first gear to start engine (and pray it works first time so you don't have to repeat).If you are in flat area with no hill to back up to, starting in reverse gives you more power: Get into reverse, push clutch with right leg and push thru opened door with left leg to develop some speed, then release clutch to try start engine. Be prepared to press clutch again, because when car starts, will have not enough speed to run (and might die like when you slow down without engaging the clutch).If your batteries are dead because you forgot to turn off lights (for few hours not days, so battery is not 100% dead, only nearly dead and has not enough juice to start your car): Before starting, turn off the lights and wait an hour or few to let the battery recover. You may also use time to find someone to jump-start car or help you to push :-)
My monitor turns off when fridge starts. How can I stop this?
This sounds remarkably like a problem that a housemate and I had some years back. Everytime the fridge kicked in, other pieces of electrical equipment in the room would stutter and sometimes die.We tried most of the suggestions I have seen in the other answers (surge protection/UPS) to no avail.After a bit of thought and investigation we discovered that the problem was the motor putting out a surge of EM and was insufficiently shielded (it was a very old fridge)The solution for us was to open up the fridge and line the inner cover around the motor with tin foil to act as a makeshift Faraday cage. After that, no more problems.tl; dr; Wrap it in tinfoil
What can I use in place of a spanner / wrench?
If you have a metal clamp, that could work well - the larger the better. A pair of pliers should also be able to do the trick, but I would try using a clamp first.
What can I use in place of a spanner / wrench?
Make your own spanner!Requirements:Bolt the size of what you want to screw.PVC pipe slightly smaller than the outside of the bolt.Metal rod to stick through the PVC (longer rod = more force).Heat (any candle or lighter will do)Something to stick the metal rod through the middle of the pipe (either drill or melt the the PVC with a heated rod).The following recipe is based on an Instructable, but I've used it myself in the past. Works fairly well for spanners you only need a couple of times.Warning!Consider PVC as a toxic material and do the following in a well ventilated area.Heat the bolt. Push the PVC pipe over the bolt. The hot bolt will melt the pipe and the pipe will take the form of the bolt.Now wait for it to cool, remove the bolt from the PVC and stick the metal rod through the middle of the PVC pipe. You got yourself a spanner!
How to get skinny jeans on more easily
Submit your skinny jeans to a steamer session right before you put them on. The steamer will hydrate the pants, making them softer and the heat will dilate it, giving to you a little more space to pass your legs through them. Also, shave your legs, like the professionals swimmers do, to reduce the friction.
How to get skinny jeans on more easily
You could try using talcum powder on your legs - this may make it easier to get on as it stops the moisture on your legs trying to stick to the inside of the trouser leg - like socks after you've been swimming.
How can I test for electrical current through bare wires without a meter?
Maybe use this.image sourceIt glows when current is present. That way you won't have to touch the wire. However, as stated by everybody, be careful.
How can I clean a vase that I can't reach inside?
Coarse Salt and Baking soda. They act well to both soak and scrub.If the stain/dirt/refuse is more stubborn there is a more severe course of action: Household Lye This is the stuff you might clean your pipes with. It is in effect Sodium Hydroxide, and creates a very strong base in water. It can literally dissolve the first few microns of glass from the surface. Be careful of fumes and do not allow this to get in contact with your skin.
How to vacuum stairs with minimal effort?
You definitely have the vacuum that makes this the hardest way to do is. I suggest a canister vacuum with long attachments and a backpack harness. One of these that J. Musser suggested in the comments Would be ideal, It allows you to safely and easily vacuum stairs. Might be a little pricey.A shop vac would also work with the proper attachment. They usually have long hoses that would allow you to get all the stairs without having to move the thing. Can be found for a reasonable price and a wide variety of configurations.
How to write in a straight line without lined paper?
As far as I know there isn't really a hack to write in a straight line, but there are a couple of tips that can help you practice:I don't know how you write, but I was taught to turn the paper at an angle when writing. If you also do so, you can try adjusting the angle as soon as you notice your lines being not straight or not parallel.If your unlined paper is thin enough (otherwise you could use a light box), put lined paper behind it and use it as a guide.When writing the first line, look at the top edge of the paper and use it as a guide. Then use the previous line as a guide for the next one.Fold the paper twice in length (pictures here) and use the created fold-areas as guides. Write your first line and notice if your handwriting is going up or down. Try to write the second line more straight, practice!I could also imagine, curved writing occurs, because we don't move our elbow (enough). Try moving the paper instead of your arm as you write a line.Always try to look at the whole page from a distance, rather than focusing on the words and letters. Your neck will thank you later.
How can I efficiently plant seeds in my garden without placing them by hand?
Get a shaker - salt/pepper/red pepper flakes/cheese... Size the holes to the size of your seeds.  Mix seeds in bag with something like sand and fill shaker.  Walk along row shaking mixture out.  As long as your seeds aren't too big or weird shaped and you've mixed them well with sand or other carrier, it should come out relatively evenly.Obviously works best with smaller round seeds - not so good for long rod shaped seeds.  Works decently for "dust" type seeds too, just use dry sand - wet and it will clump.  Also nicely shows where you sprinkled.
How to write in a straight line without lined paper?
There a several options to create an invisible line to help you write:Draw thin lines with a pencil and erase them afterwards. If you work with a soft pencil and without much force, the lines are easily erasable and you won`t mark the sheet. If you are working on a poster, you could also provide a line with the help of a beamer/over head projector or some fancy laser liner. It should work best if you are left handed, since you otherwise cover the line with your arm/hand. Here is an example. Also, you can work at the edge of a table or by placing a ruler under the paper. You will notice directly if you are not on the line. But it will be not beneficial for your style.  
I forgot my toothpaste and it is impossible to buy in this situation, are there any substitutes?
Use the twigs of this plant : Azadirachta indica in simple English, it is called Neem. Easy identification: look for leaf shape (in image) and leaf length is no more than 6-7 cm. Smells slightly bitter. Has excellent medicinal and germicidal qualities. It is still used as a common substitute for toothpaste in India, Asia.Image source: Google
How do I chew bubble gum if I am wearing dental braces?
As you already know, it is not good to chew gum if you are wearing braces. But still you like it. I am not sure, but before chewing gum you can lubricate your braces with some oil using your fingers or dipping a soft brush into the oil. This will prevent the gum from sticking to your braces.Note of Caution: Try this with the oil that can be taken directly. Like olive oil (please confirm).
How to unblock a blocked drain without acids/chemicals?
You can usually find a Zipit, a sort of small disposable plastic drain snake, at a nearby store. They have a very simple design, are cheap, and will clear out most of your blocked sink and shower drains very easily. If the blockage is further down you may need to contact a professional or rent an auger.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
For immediate relief, there are two similar things that I will try.First, I take a hot shower (make the shower as hot as you can withstand). Make sure to breath in and out deeply to fill your nasal passages and your lungs with steam. If that doesn't immediately make me feel better, I will also use a pot of boiling water. Just boil the water, drape a towel over your head (helps trap steam) and breath in the steam. This will help a lot.One last tip is to keep your head elevated while sleeping. Don't use extra pillows, try to elevate your entire body from the waist up, or you can use books under your bed to make it like a hospital bed.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
In addition to the tips regarding trying to clear everything out before going to bed, I sometimes have to resort to sleeping in a good chair in a rather upright sitting position with support for my head (and usually with a leg rest).This way I'm able to get some sleep, although the quality of sleep is better in a bed when the nose is clear.
How can I make sure I get the USB plug in the right way up?
One method that always works for me is looking at the connector itself. The bottom side of the connector has a "seam" as can be seen in the USB A side in this photo. Also, notice the 2 holes on either side of the seam are white and blocked, wheras on the other side they are open. So if you see the seam and holes filled with white, flip it over.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
Instead of a decongestant take a cheap anti-histamine like diphenhydramine (Benadryl). In addition stopping the flow of mucus, the first generation anti-histamines make you so drowsy you'll have hard time staying awake even if you wanted to.
How can I make sure I get the USB plug in the right way up?
It seems simple enough but if that were the case then we wouldn't be looking for a hack.My wife sticks a colorful little jewel from my daughter's BDazzle kit on both the cord and the resepticle. This works better than a dab of nail polish or a sticker because most of the time I'm reaching around the back side or under something to plug in.  I can feel the jewel under my finger and line it up with its opposite number.
How to keep the windshield from freezing over?
The best solution is to get the car into a garage or carport if possible. Surprised no one has mentioned that so far. Some sort of roof over the car is really helpful.If not those are available, then natural shelter like large trees could be helpful, in addition to covering the windshield like described in other answers. I've also seen cars parked next to ventilation or air condition vents to refuse the warmer air, but you got to have some luck for that to be available.
How to unblock a blocked drain without acids/chemicals?
I have used the following, done in the order.1) Plunge out existing water sitting in front of clog.2) Use a clothes hanger or ZipIt to Try to snag and pull out as well as break up some stuff on the sides of the drain as well potentially the clog.3) Refill with water flushing it out, then plunge water out so little to no water in front of the clog.4) Then use a Floor / Curtain Steamer without the floor attachment inserted into the drain with a rag around the drain to trap the steam. Plug the second sink to such as with a garbage disposal. (you should see little steam rising out) Do for 5-10 minutes.5) Flush with water. If still clogged repeat steps 3-5.This basically breaks down the clogging agents (if organic) at the point of the clog but also cleans the interior of the pipes a bit reducing risk of another clog. There is some risk of damage as with any unclogging method, but in this one so far as I am aware is exposing holes / cracks the goo in your drains has been dealing as PVC pipes used in drain plumbing should be able to handle the steam temperature just fine.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
Try taking a paracetamol. Although it is mainly a painkiller, it also has an anti-inflammatory action too. This can help by reducing swelling and that can affect the nasal membranes. What we consider to be a "blocked nose" is usually nothing of the sort, it is soft tissue of the nose swollen up and blocking the airway all on its own.I used to suffer from hayfever and once or twice tried paracetamol to help with sleep and it seemed to work for me.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
Oh, I know what you mean. I have the same problem. There are two important factors to this:air qualityposition of the headI noticed that the position of the head may hinder the breathing. If I move my head a little backwards the nostrils open up and it's easier to breathe. As for the air: keep it clean (no dust - open your windows for a while before you go to sleep) and keep it humid. Humidity is so important, especially in winter when the heaters make the air very dry. I bought some air humidifiers and the problem is gone.When that doesn't work, you may have an allergy (dust, mites) and it would be a good idea to consult a doctor.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
I tend to create nose plugs out of tissue paper... it's not pretty, but its the running mucus which keeps me awake not the stuffy part. Once they're in my nose (big enough so they are easy to pull out).. then it gives me the chance I need to fall asleep.Good luck.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
The main problem with OTC decongestants is that your sinuses basically become "addicted" to them very quickly, giving a rebound effect when you attempt to quit using them which is often more severe than the initial problem, this is a condition called Rhinitis Medicamentosa.One approach is to dilute the spray with saline solution over a period of time, weaning the tissue off the drug.  You might also try substituting one of the corticosteroid sprays which have recently become available OTC and they are said to have less of this rebound tendency for a period of time until your sinuses readjust.  
How to vacuum stairs with minimal effort?
I leave the cleaner at the bottom of the stairs and use one of these to extend the hose:http://www.coopersofstortford.co.uk/src/gbase/coopers-of-stortford-universally-fitting-5m-vacuum-extension-hose-prodst07691i/?gclid=CJyAnOeZs8QCFSzKtAodYBAAGg
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
I have just finished dealing with this same problem last week, here are a few things that helped me get over it:Put on some chap stick and breath through your mouth.Don't go too crazy with the decongestants, you could end up "crashing hard" and prolonging the congestion period.Wasabi and horseradish are really good at decreasing the swelling in your nasal passages. And no, I'm not some "all natural against western medicine" person, if it works I do it and horseradish works! 
How to vacuum stairs with minimal effort?
Canister vacuums are heavy and expensive and unsuited to single family residences.  The hose extension is a much better option but is likely too short for an entire flight of stairs making it necessary to work first from the top, then from the bottom.My solution was to use a handheld DustBuster type vacuum ($40) on a regular basis and only drag out the regular vacuum once a quarter or so.
How to quickly cure headaches without medicine
Eat salted nuts and wash them down with water.There are three common causes that account for the bulk of all headaches (not counting migraines).  They are lack of potassium, lack of protein, and dehydration.  Salted nuts alleviate the first two and water resolves the third.  Results in just a few minutes.By way of notes, if you were inclined to argue about muscle tension headaches that's what potassium does.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
I use an oral decongestant like time released generic sudafed. A nasal steroid spray only after I spray or snort a nasal saline solution to loosen mucus and irrigate the nasal passages.Last I use a breathe rite strip (clear works better, easier to remove in the morning).Sleeping with the head elevated or upright in a recliner also helps.
How to jump start a car without another car
The batteries age and their capacity to deliver the proper amount of current decreases, it is most noticeable when the temperature drops. All the drivers that live in areas where the temperature drops to -20Celsius - in the night - are aware of this.Your local battery shop should have a battery tester to assess the main electrical characteristics of the battery and the charging circuitry on the car. It is worth to do a check on your battery, it might be just as simple as replacing the old battery.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
My mother used to cut an onion and place it on a plate near my bed. You could try that.I also like to have something soft like a towel under my pillow. That way my head is a bit more upwards, instead of lying down flat. It makes sleeping more comfortable for me.
How can I easily open plastic film wrapped packages?
The answer to this is similar to that of How to separate plastic grocery bags? You need to increase the friction between your fingers and the plastic. Quoting from my answer to that question:Breathe on your finger tips (not blow; breathe. like breathing on a cold window to fog it up.) before using them to pull at the plastic bag. Slightly moistening your fingertips provides greater friction and therefore a better chance of success.After doing so, squeeze the box and pull. The wrapping should break right off.Sometimes, at either end of the box, there is a folded plastic flap at each narrow end. You can often pull at any of these to open the plastic.
Cleaning a dirty computer screen
No microfiber cloth, no glass cleaning cloth! And the cotton cloth only smears/disseminate it.  Now what to do?In a small effort to accodomate a question marked as duplicate, where the above restrictions apply, here is another few options for cleaning a glass surface: First of all, if the restrictions doesn't apply to you, then you most likely are better of using the microfiber cloth or the glass cleaning cloth!To help clean the surface using a cotton cloth (of sorts), not only smearing everything about, you could try using a small amount of dishwashing liquid, or possibly a thinned out vinegar solutionIf cotton cloths are not feasible to do the job, you could opt for either an old newspaper or a coffee filter. Both can be used, but do be careful not to scratch glass. Neither will leave residue/stains on the glass, but can be helpful clearing the glassAlways be careful when applying any liquid to electrical components, like touchscreens or LCD screens. Also do not use excessive force when rubbing these devices.
How can I easily open plastic film wrapped packages?
Usually I pop the plastic wrapping with something I have to hand. It is a little quicker and easier in some instances.I usually have a pen or a screw driver which seem to be perfect for the job.
How can I easily open plastic film wrapped packages?
Often I have the impression that these packages were not meant to be opened too. Especially refractory are those plastic wrappings around CD-Cases.Unless, for any reason, we need to keep the wrapping I cut them apart. To do this quickly I use a knife, or an open pair of scissors to cut along the rims of the package underneath (i.e. cardboard, or jewel case).This gives a slit in the wrapping that will leave enough space for my finger to fit under it and I can easily tear it off.
How To Get Food Out of Braces
Back when I had braces myself, I faced the same problem. My orthodontist recommended Oral-B Super-Floss (don't want to advertise, but I just don't know a comparable dental floss). This indeed is perfect for use with braces, but normal dental floss works as well.As mentioned by Trish Ling you can use brushpicks as well.These are handy and easy to carry, so perfect for your scenario at school.At home I had some kind of "brush stick". They look like this and probably are also available in the dental section of your local store, just as brushpicks are:There may be no new insights here, but I just wanted to share my experience and save you from searching for images.Keep in mind: All above methods best work in front of a mirror. So if you have to go to the bathroom anyway, brushing your teeth may still be the best solution.
How to write in a straight line without lined paper?
You could get a ruler or yard stick (depending on what size your project is) and tape it's sides down.  Then you could slide the paper (or poster board or whatever) under the ruler/yard stick and use it like a pseudo-line to help keep your writing straight.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
You can try the following:Ginger Tea: Just add a small (crushed) piece of ginger to your tea. And you can also add crushed clove, in addition to ginger.Spicy Food: Some hot and spicy foods can relieve sinus congestion because they help to keep your mucous thin. Food with mucokinetics, or mucous-thinning activity, include chilli peppers, garlic, black pepper and curry spices. Capsaicin found in pepper makes your nose run helping you clear your nasal passage. Vicks Vapor rub: Apply it on your nose just before you sleep and cover you face with blanket, leave a very small space for breathing. This will let the rub work more better. You can buy it from Amazon.I have tried all the above methods. It helped me. But you should choose the one that suits you the best.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
I have this problem most of the time because of allergic rhinitis - I do use a steroid spray, but sometimes, the sinuses get blocked because of a cold or because the pollution's high, and I start to feel muzzy and a bit dizzy. I put off doing the following, its such a faff and makes my fringe (bangs for folks from the USA) frizzy, but when I do force myself to do it, it works really well. It's an old fashioned thing - an inhalation. Just means boiling a kettle of water, pouring some into a bowl, adding whatever you've got handy (Vick, Olbas Oil, Karvol, or the cheapest, a teaspoon of menthol and eucalyptus in a brown bottle from the pharmacy), throwing a towel or something large over your head and the bowl to make a tent, leaning forward over the bowl and inhaling the vapours as deeply as possible for a few minutes. You usually find you have to emerge after a minute or two to blow your nose, but then continue the procedure. Tedious - but it does work. Best done within a couple of hours of going to bed, although repeated treatments during the day do no harm. Its also important to make sure you sleep with the window slightly open, so the air's cooler and is moving.
How can I easily open plastic film wrapped packages?
You need a sharpish object - I use whatever I've got, quite often a metal nail file or a key if I'm out. With a key, you have to sort of scratch into the plastic to rip it, then get your fingers in to pull it off. Indoors, I use a sharp, pointed knife to puncture the plastic (use it at an angle, you're trying to slide the knife into the plastic rather than puncture the container).My vision's not what it was, and there's nothing more frustrating than finally locating the pull tab and having it come off before its done the job, so I don't bother, out comes a knife.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
Your sinuses are suffering from vasodilatation or nasal congestion.  There's nothing to blow out that will unblock them because the passages themselves are shrinking due to the blood vessels increasing in size, and the nasal passages shrinking as a result.Normally your sinuses do this throughout the day following a nasal cycle that allows one side to rest and remoisten while the other side handles the majority of the airflow. The frequency of this cycle depends on the environmental factors.But now your body is fighting an infection and it's decided to play Madagascar and shut down everything.  Both nostrils are not only congested, but severely so, to the point where you can't use them.Some of the treatments suggested do provide some relief.  Sitting up decreases blood pressure in the head, decreasing vasodilation. Hot steam provides very temporary relief. A nasal strip can pull the nasal passages open a little more widely.  If your congestion isn't severe, or if you fall asleep quickly, then these might be sufficient.It sounds like your congestion is bad enough, though, that you should look at vasoconstricting medications, otherwise known as decongestants. I recognize you've tried some decongestants, but there're two things you need to understand - first, one very common, over the counter decongestant in the US may not be effective, and second, a nasal spray decongestant should be tried if you've only taken oral decongestants so far.Typically nasal decongestants will work in most cases. Pseudoephedrine is the most common over the counter oral decongestant that people indicate works, though in the US it is controlled so you'll have to ask your pharmacist for it (no prescription required). Note that if you're buying an over-the-counter decongestant in the US that doesn't require you to visit the pharmacist, it's probably Phenylephrine, and "clinical studies suggest that phenylephrine is ... not more effective than placebo".  Make sure you try Pseudoephedrine before you give up on oral decongestants. Check your medicine ingredients, and talk to your pharmacist if you have any questions.When that doesn't work, however, I've found that a direct decongestant spray, oxymetazoline, works very quickly and effectively.  This is common enough that you can find it in many brand names and generics, such as Afrin.  There are a number of nasal sprays that claim decongesting effects, but some are simply saline spray.  Make sure you try one with oxymetazoline.They all work the same way but use different routes to the affected area. Direct nasal spray application works very quickly, but can't be timed release, so may need to be used more frequently than an oral decongestant.  Further, they are different drugs, so if one doesn't work, it's worth trying another to see how your body reacts. For me, oxymetazoline beats Pseudoephedrine which beats phenylephrine.There is an issue where if you consistently use them your body starts to work harder to close your nasal passages, which means that once you stop you become congested even if you would normally not be congested at that point.  As such, I've limited my use to only when I need to get to sleep, and usually only one spray (1/2 to 1/3 the recommended dose) in one nostril (I don't need both open to sleep), and alternate nostrils each night. Usually, I've only needed it for a day or two.  If it appears you need it for more than a few days in a row, you should probably consult your doctor or GP to check for bacterial infection or other causes, or a plan to wean you from the medication once the cause is resolved.
How to make sun view glasses from home supplies
If you happen to be a bit of a welder - you can use shade 14 welder's glass which is basically a neutral density filter which will be enough protection for your eyes from the Sun's glare. This sort of material is usually available from some hardware stores and it can always be obtained online if not (I would add a link to somewhere you could get it but I would get a telling off so just Google "#14 Welder's Glass") - it is by far the cheapest alternative compared to professional filters and other such things.You will have to make sure that the glass completely covers both of your eyes while you are viewing the Sun in order to avoid permanent damage to them.You could get away with stacking a few lighter shades of welder's glass on top of each other and viewing through them as the lighter ones are sometimes more commonly available than #14. (Note: It is probably safe to use down to shade 12 Welder's Glass, but I wouldn't over expose my eyes to the Sun if you opt for going slightly lower than #14)You can even place the glass over your binocular lenses so you can have a zoomed view of the Sun.
How can I easily open plastic film wrapped packages?
Takkat suggested any sharp or pointy object that's nearby, and I agree.  I just want to add one more tip.Often the plastic is folded over itself and sealed, usually on a diagonal like a gift-wrapped present. It's easier to poke & tear along the edges of the folds instead of in the middle of a sheet.
How to make sun view glasses from home supplies
Smoked glass.  Take a piece of flat glass and a candle, wave the glass around in the candle flame so that black carbon soot is deposited on it.  Make a thick, uniform coating (you may have to let it cool a few times and make sure to wear safety gloves to protect your hands and fingers - better yet, use a pair of tongs to hold the glass), and test it until it blocks enough sunlight.

I would suggest taking a eucalyptus/menthol lozenge or inhalation of Menthol & Eucalyptus Oil to clear your nose.
How can I easily open plastic film wrapped packages?
I always use my keys for something like this - one key in particular (my parents' house key) works much better than the others, so try different keys if the first one doesn't seem to get a good "bite" in the plastic.
How to sleep with a stuffy / blocked nose?
I would recommend using some form of nasal irrigation before going to bed.The idea is to run a mild salt solution through your nasal passages which clears stuffiness out and helps disinfect and thus de-inflame.  It sounds kind of gross, but it really works well for me.Without making any specific product recommendations, there are several inexpensive products available usually available in your local pharmacy (assuming US).Additionally you may have a deviated septum which will make your situation worse.  It might be worth getting it checked out by an ENT specialist.
How to Stop Scratching
This may be more mental or psychological than an actual physical hack.I once heard you just need to think that you're scratching your itchy skin. Like you said in your comment, this depends on ones degree of mental strength.If this fails, try to distract yourself from the itchiness: Do not think about it! Do something you like, preferably something that involves movement like dancing or doing sports. (1)In the above reference you'll also find some tips. I'll just include the ones that may help with lotion already on the skin:Instead of scratching, try rubbing it lightly or slapping it.If you can, cover the irritated area with a band aid.Apply direct pressure to itchy areas.
How to make sun view glasses from home supplies
You can use your smartphone to watch it, but only if it has a front camera. Use the front camera, and turn your back to the sun. You can then safely watch the sun on your screen and can even record it for viewing pleasure again and again. Do not use the rear / main camera on your phone unless you are wearing solar glasses, while the camera doesn't have retinas that could be damaged by the Sun's rays, your eyes still could be as you'll be facing towards the Sun to take any pictures / videos.Sorry if you actually are interested in making some sort of glasses, but this tip might help some people. 
How to Stop Scratching
I tend to find that I need to do something else to the afflicted area to relieve / or distract me from the itchiness.A couple of things that I have done before with varying success are:Apply cold to the area - Just rubbing over a cool glass or chilled drinks can can do wonders to relieving the itching sensationInflict pain on or around the area - This can vary from a firm slap to me stabbing it with something sharp like a pen or pencil (I'm not a sadist or anything, only do it if you're comfortable and don't do any serious damage to yourself)Bathe the area in warm or cold water - I sometimes get really itchy eyes so opt for putting them under running cold water to try and relieve some of the irritation. Experiment with both cold and warm water to see what works for you bestCover the area - If you are unable to stop the urge to scratch, then you can just employ a physical barrier to completely stop you from being able to scratch. Unless of course you just remove said barrier to get the itchy goodness but then you must really love to scratchPut pressure on it - Sometimes I just find the most simple thing is to put a deal of pressure on it either by sitting on (if possible) or laying on it. This is usually the most effective for me personally so it might work for you too.Just as an extra note - if it is the lotion that is causing the itchiness you might have an allergy to it or something so I would suggest trying a different brand or product. Just something to think about as it could remove the problem all together!
How to Stop Scratching
I felt this answer warranted a separate post (as to avoid an overly long list) so here is one final method that I've just thought of and it should work:Get some clingfilmApply your lotion to said clingfilm - enough to cover your itchy areaPlace clingfilm, lotion side down, over your itchy area and wrap it around the body part to keep it in placeDone.This is what they advise you do with a serious burn as it prevents scarring, I assume it would also have relieving effects for an itchy area too! (You could probably get away with a bandage as it would let the skin breath and stop it getting really sweaty and what not but it's up to you)If it is your hands that are the itchy area, you could do the same with a latex glove or similar - put some lotion in there and then put the glove on!I would think that chilling the lotion before applying it might work (unless it states otherwise on the label - always read the label) also.

How to make sun view glasses from home supplies
Even as now the solar eclipse is over I want to post an answer :)Please note, that it is extreamly dangerous to look into the sun directly, as it (the UV light) may damage your eyes irreparably. It is recommended by all officials to NOT! use smoked glass or even welders glass (under #14), rescue blankets, CDs, X-rays or anything improvised. The risk of damaging or losing your sight is always there. It is only recommended to use good specs made with the special filter foil or with a digital camera while using the screen (as @Izzo worte).Perhaps, if you are a hobby astronomer or photographer, you might have the special filter foil you use to look at the sun with a telescope or camera to take good pictures of the sun at home. These filter foils are also availble in photographer shops. https://astrosolar.com/en/information/how-to/how-to-make-your-own-objective-solar-filter-for-your-camera-or-telescope/ I hope this link is okay. It`s a producer but also an astrolab  and they  have some building instructions. e.g. how to change a binocular using foil. Otherwise just use a live stream :)
How to transport liquids without spilling?
The trick is to sort of isolate your arm and shoulder from the rest of your body when you're moving, so that your body's moving but the combined unit of your arm, shoulder, and hand carrying the drink isn't.  The only way I can achieve this is to fix my attention on what I'm carrying rather than looking at the floor or stairs as I walk, but it's much more difficult on uneven terrain. It does require a bit of practice to get the technique off pat. I'd also say it's easier to go upstairs with a drink in hand in this way than it is to go downstairs, particularly if there's a handrail to hold onto with your other hand - I suspect because one's peripheral vision is taking in the stairway when going up, and the handrail provides more stability. If I have to carry drinks downstairs, I just don't fill right to the top, but still manage to slop it a bit anyway. Having a tray or a saucer just means, when it slops over, it's at least on the tray and not on the floor, but doesn't seem to improve the chances of not spilling it, in fact, quite the opposite - I'm more likely to spill something on a tray than directly in my hand, but that may simply be down to lack of practice. It might be better for you to buy yourself one of those cups with a lid for carrying downstairs.

How to make an adapter for a micro SIM?
When I had this situation, I was able to slide the micro-SIM into the correct position manually and tape it into place, but this depends on having a phone with an open SIM slot (e.g. under the battery rather than in the side edge of the phone) where it is possible to see the locations of the contacts clearly, and to remove the card later.
How do you stay productive during the afternoon energy slump?
I think many people, after their midday meal, tend to sit still afterwards to "digest". This can cause sleepiness. If you have extra time on your lunch break after finishing your food, take a walk. Whether it's around the building, or outside for some fresh air, moving around a bit can do you a world of good. You could even get up and stretch your legs anytime you start to feel your brain shutting down (i.e. sleepy).Common practice in some Asian countries (Taiwan, at least) since lunch breaks tend to be longer there, is to take a short nap after lunch. Literally, lay your head on your desk and nap. I suppose this can help to restore some energy and get rid of sleepiness. Never really picked up the habit while I was there.Lastly, though my comment was joking in nature, caffeine might actually be a doable option. Coffee, soda, whatever. It may give you just what you need.

How to ease upset stomach when hungover?
The main reason people get stomach aches when they are hungover is because drinking a lot of alcohol raises the level of acid in your stomach. To cure this, you need to soak up the acid. Eating something dry like plain toast (nothing on it) or saltine crackers. I know you don't want to eat anything because you don't want to vomit, but these foods are not tough on your stomach, so you shouldn't have to throw up. If you do throw up, it's not all bad because vomiting can help you cure your stomach ache. Also, to avoid a hangover, try to drink lots of water before you go to sleep the night you were drinking.

How to clean inside of straw
Your best option is to use a pipe cleaner. Add some dish soap to the pipe cleaner. I like to dip the pipe cleaner in a bottle of soap, but you can pour soap on it. Now just push the pipe cleaner through the straw and rinse it with water. If you have a straw that has too wide of a diameter for on pipe cleaner, you can braid 2 or 3 together to make it wider.
How to clean inside of straw
I would just hold the straw in a vertical position with one of my fingers covering the bottom of the straw. Pour some soap into the top of the straw. Then pour some warm water into the top of the straw. At this point you can just keep the water running for a while and then eventually remove your finger from the bottom of the straw and rinse the straw out. Or you could cover the top end as well with another finger and then shake the straw all about letting the water hit the edges of the inside straw over and over again. And then rinse it out.If you want to make sure it gets clean as possible, then you could just repeat the above steps a few times.
How to remove build up of biofilm within pipes
Vinegar, baking soda, and boiling water.Start some water boiling. Pour 1/2 cup baking soda down your drain. Wait a few minutes. Pour 1/2 cup vinegar down the drain. Cover with a cloth (in case it is too reactive and bubbles out of the plug). Get the boiling water and pour it down the drain after the reaction between the baking soda and vinegar has died down.Note: The pipes will sound like heck! They crack, sputter, and make all sorts of weird noises. This is normal. Be not afraid!If you find more buildup after a while, you can try just pour boiling water down the drain, as it may clear it out with just water (we have a slow draining sink, and this helps tremendously).

Now make a long strip of this fabric and wrap it around the stick or wire in a diagonal wrapping fashion. Wrap it tight, your scrubber is ready. Now dip the wrapped stick in soap added water for some time. Now use this scrubber to wash your straw. Move the scrubber in and out of the straw to clean it as required. 
How to get skinny jeans on more easily
You could try:Laying on your back and then after they are pulled on halfway picking your butt up and pulling them on this way. This way you get more leverage.Wear socks. When putting on TED hose wearing socks first sometimes makes it easier. Pick thin socks and not fluffy ones. This may make your legs feel more comfortable, as the jeans will glide over the socks. If you wear panty hose this also makes it easier. You could also try adding another zipper on the waistband so that you have more room to scoot into them with. This takes sewing skills.
How can I neutralize the odor of Tide washing detergent?
I have recently read that you can soak the garments afflicted with the stench in water with some Vitamin C powder mixed in. If you don't have any powder you can pop open a couple of the caplets and pour the contents into the water.You could actually put the Vitamin C powder in with your washing detergent and that should be able to aid in reducing the smell.Once you have finished washing, if possible, always allow the clothes to dry out in the sunshine - it is amazing what a bit of Sunlight can do to help!
How to clean inside of straw
Now for some truly out of the box thinking with my newly devised straw cleaning apparatus.Equipment needed:Dirty straw (otherwise this whole thing is not needed...)A couple of balloons (water balloons preferably, and small ones!)Elastic band / hair band / stringWaterSoap (liquid variety)Optional - Sand or other coarse grained thing (for abrasiveness to get off stubborn dirt)What you'll need to do:Fill one water balloon with some water and some soap (enough to easily be able to squeeze the water out) and the sand if you so choosePlace straw into filled balloon and tie with elastic band / string / whatever to stop it coming offPlace other balloon at the other end of the straw and tie off as wellSqueeze the filled balloon and the water should race through the straw to the other balloonRepeat a few times - the sand would aid in removing some stuck bits of grime (which FYI is absolutely grim so just buy a new straw you weirdo)Remove balloons and put straw under some running water so that it can clean out any left over soap / sandDone.As I said - this required a little out of the box thinking and may be more effort than it is worth, but it would be fun to see if it is effective!Godspeed.
How to clean inside of straw
An adaptation to a couple of methods already mentioned that involves shoving something down the straw to try and get rid of any dirt.You could use an ear cleaner (Q-Tip) - preferably a clean one. Get it wet and add a little bit of soap and that should be quite nifty.Dental floss - if you feed a length of this down the straw and keep tight and wiggle the straw around, this should have good cleaning potential (after all, people clean their teeth with this stuff)Alternatives to dental floss:StringElastic bandA chain (like a necklace)A shoelace - a clean one (would, I think, be the most effective as it'll be a similar width to the straw so be nice and tight to the edges)Buy a new one.

How can I get wrinkles out of a dress I can't Iron or wash?
Steaming wrinkles out works rather well. I would recommend trying to steam it as lightly as possible to ensure you don't damage the dress. Additionally, small hand-held steamers would allow you the opportunity to steam out wrinkles where you want to without affecting the entire dress (to include those intentional folds you mentioned).

How can I get rid of large amounts of cardboard boxes
Obviously if you put the boxes into the trash, they will take up a lot of space due to their shape.  There will be a lot of wasted empty space in the trash since nothing is inside the boxes.So just tear up the boxes into a lot of flat pieces.  Each box has 6 sides, so you'll want to tear up each box into at least 6 pieces.  Once you have torn up the boxes into flat pieces, you can fit a lot more of those pieces into the trash, and there won't be any wasted space in the trash.

How to have cross ventilation in a single window room?
A simple solution that does really help in a room like this is to have the window open, but also have the door open. This will allow the hot air to have somewhere to go rather than just circulate around the room. If you don't have the window open (because it is too hot outside and is cooler to keep them shut) then you can continue to use your ceiling fan as you are, but again with the door open.I know most people don't like having their door open while sleeping, but even if it is just open a small amount, it will help with air circulation - not only with temperature regulation, but it'll also stop your room becoming a stink pit.If your door automatically closes you can just put something in the way so that it remains open at least a small amount. But note that the more the door is open, the more circulation you'll get.

You state that you can't have the window open due to a stray cat possibly entering the room. This still is your best option to access colder air, so I would suggest to open the window and add something like wire mesh over the window so that the cat can't enter. This will depend on approval from the landlord, but if done correctly it should not degrade the apartment, and it should also be possible to do without leaving marks on/around the window.

How to clean dead skin off feet?
If you don't want to buy any sort of pedicure product designed for this then there are a couple of other alternatives that I can think of and that I have personally used in the past:Rub with something rough - Like the pedicure stones and scrubbers, you can just find something rough and rub the dead skin away (i.e. sandpaper [fine grain to save your feet from bleeding], stones / rocks, pavement, etc.)Cut it off - While perhaps not being the safest method, you can always get a fairly sharp knife and cut away the dead skin (best for working around the heel), but be careful not to cut too deep into new skin otherwise you'll eb walking funny for a little while.Pick at it - I used to get really flaky feet and I could entertain myself for a fair while by just getting a pair of tweezers or similar and picking away at the dead skin trying to get rid of it - while it isn't actually very effective, it kept me happy for a while.In the end, I had to start applying some serious moisturizer (betnovate) to the feet daily in order to get rid of it completely - then again I think mine was a fungus of sorts.You could always try and stop it at the source by not putting baking soda in your shoes any more, try finding an alternative that would be less harsh on your feet. I am sure there are special aerating inner soles that you could find to treat the issue of smelly feet.
How do I scratch the middle of my back in a car?
I find just simply stretching my arms as far as possible (while keeping control of the vehicle) will make the middle of the back more exposed to the seat. Then you can just rub you back up against the chair - hard enough so that it can somewhat satisfy the itchiness.Note, this is useless if you're in a leather seated car.

The trick is to control the sopping of the fluids and other stuff. When carrying a glass, you can move it forward pretty quickly without spilling it by tilting the glass. The same applies for trays, plates, etc. Whenever you are walking around, make sure you swish you fluids accordingly in the same manner.
How to clean dead skin off feet?
Feet are tender so I don't think you should attack them with tweezers or knifes. Reasons:By pulling the skin off you can create openings that can get infected. Knives can also cut you and open you to infection. Your hand may not be steady enough and the knife may be dirty.Things you can do:Use exfoliants. Moisturizing will make the skin fall of and promote more healthier skin. With that I offer these tips:Scrub your feet in a hot water bath. Soaking before scrubbing helps you remove the skin as well. Now add moisturizer and clean your shoes. Replacing inner soles and washing shoes should help. Dirty shoes may cause infection.If you are interested in feet stone alternatives:Fine grain sand paper. This works just the same mostly, I even make nail files out of it.Make salt scrubs out of oils and salt, always moisturizer after ward. Using loose oils and letting them sit works better.Using emery boards would work to. Additional infoEhow. ComWarning: There are no alternatives to going to a foot doctor who can actually diagnose you. You may have a skin condition.
How do I extract a small object from a vacuum cleaner bag?

Try using water. Take the dust and put it in a plastic garbage bag and then add water slowly while holding the bag as shut as you can. Now that the dust is wet you can handle it without it blowing in your face. Add the mixture slowly to a bowl or buckets of water and the dust should float making anything appear.If the earring is big you can sift through the wet dust. Please do either method outside so that any spilt dust does not go in your face.
How do I extract a small object from a vacuum cleaner bag?
The dustbag contains not only dust and dirt - it's also heaving with bacteria, so although I do exactly what you now intend to do, I first take the precaution of wearing a face mask (just a basic dust mask) and rubber gloves. If you can, take the bag outside and spread a sheet of something (plastic, tarpaulin, whatever) and put the bag on it. If its disposable, then slit it open and rummage for what you want, if not, you'll have to either put your hand in and rummage, or gently tip and pull out the contents onto your sheet and poke around to find the object. Best not done on a windy day... and after all that, I hope it is your earring and not something you don't even want, like a bottle top!
Get Shampoo and Conditioner Out of My Eyes
This is not directly an answer to your question, but rather a solution: Have you tried to use friendly shampoos that don't cause this? (Disclaimer: I could name dozens of companies who increase their income by claiming they produucts are eye-friendly while they are not.) I have got very sensitive eyes and trying 3 or 4 different shampoos I found one that doesn't cause me any problem. I don't use anything else since then.(I would name the company, but I'm not sure what's the policy on advertisement. I can, however, assure you that you have a better chance in a pharmacy or a special cosmetics shops then in a general drug store or a supermarket.)
How do I extract a small object from a vacuum cleaner bag?
The trick to this for me has always been surface area. I cut open an old grocery store plastic bag, and lay it on a table. I then cut open the dust bag, and carefully spread it into as thin of a layer as possible so that there's no need to dig a lot. Cleanup is simple: fold the grocery bag to seal the dust. In general, you're trying to avoid getting dust into the air column, and the surest way to do that is to disrupt the pile as little as possible. If the depth of the pile is this enough, you should be able to do a quick visible inspection in order to find your lost trinket.I also tend to use a pair of tweezers to work through the debris or fish things out of the bag when I can see them towards the top.
How do I extract a small object from a vacuum cleaner bag?
Get a second vacuum with a hose attachment.  Over the opening of the hose, attach (with duct tape?) a screen that will let through dust and dirt but nothing bigger than, say, a popcorn kernel.  Then simply vacuum all the dust from the first vacuum's bag into the second vacuum's bag through the hose.  The larger object -- such as an earring -- will get caught by the screen or will just remain in the first bag.
How to jump start a car without another car
There is a method that works for most manual cars, which simply involves getting the car moving before starting the engine, otherwise knows as a push start - this will work for new batteries without damaging them as the method above would.Two variations of the method which would have the same effect:Get a few people to help push the car, push the clutch all the way down and put it into the second gear (do not release clutch just yet). Begin pushing the car and once it has gathered some speed - pop the clutch and the engine should start, and the car's alternator should start charging the battery again. The ignition should be turned to 'on'. If it doesn't work initially, keep depressing and releasing the clutch and it should eventually be successful.Park at the top of a hill / incline facing down - make sure you have the emergency brake on. When you return to your car, release the brake and do the same as mentioned in the previous method. - This method doesn't need people but there is a slight lack of control as your brakes will be less effective with the engine off should this method fail.For both of these variations you only need to be up to a speed of ~ 5 mph (~ 8 kph) before releasing the clutch for it to work - any slower and it will likely fail, faster will still work but has greater risks involved (i.e. lack of power steering when engine off - child in road, no easy way to swerve, splat. Child pancakes for breakfast.)

How to put a bandaid on the tip of your finger
We can very easily make our special fingertip bandaid from a standard bandaid by using a clean pair of scissors (consider rinsing the scissors in desinfenctant (e.g. alcohol) or heating is shortly with a lighter before use).Then we can cut out a trapezoid shape at the long sides of the bandaid to leave the pad in the middle, and to obtain lateral plaster flaps that will perfectly hold the baindaid in place.The size of both the bandaid, and the cuts we make depend on the size of the injured finger. In addition, the way we cut also depends on the make of our standard bandaid. If it was a whole strip with wound pads to the outer sides we have to remove parts of the central wound pad, if the lateral plaster rim was wide enough and the wound bad small, we can just cut the sides of the trapeziod but leave the plaster to additional fix the bandaid.

Pinch your nose. Similarly to scratching an itch, pinching your nose will stop the tickling sensation.
How do I stop toothpaste from piling up on the cover?
You need to prevent oxygen from reacting with the toothpaste. Usually people would just reapply the cap, but you could store in a ziplock bag or similar airtight container.
How does one efficiently clean-up hair from sink after shaving or trimming beard?
This is just a guess since I am a female and don't shave my face, butI think it'd work if you put a towel in the sink before you shave, just lay it out on the surface and then shave, the hair will fall on the towel and you can still use the tap. Afterwards you can just fold the towel and put it in the laundry.
How do I extract a small object from a vacuum cleaner bag?
One method to recover the potential earring would be to take the bag to an open area where making a mess would not be a concern, and just splitting the bag and spilling its contents.The wind will carry away the dust and fine particles (hold the bag from upwind) and the earring and other heavy objects will fall straight down. Just be sure to clean up the bag pieces and other large refuse so as to leave the area unpolluted.

With a party game.See who can clean the floor the best with soap and water.
How do I extract a small object from a vacuum cleaner bag?
Get a really strong rare earth magnet and run it around the part of the bag that would be the top of the dirt pile. If you feel it connect to something, bring it to the top of the bag and then try to pull it out with your finger. If your earring was a non-magnetic metal (which is most likely) and this plan doesn't work, it's likely you will feel extreme rage having failed after all the trouble of getting the magnet. To handle that, tell the vacuum you hate it, optionally kick it a few times, then tell it it's sacked. Then go watch QVC so you can buy a new earring.
How do I clean my sticky floor after a party night?
Hire a cleaning service. They're experts when it come to cleaning, and have the proper tools and skills one needs for cleaning up any mess.
How does one efficiently clean-up hair from sink after shaving or trimming beard?
Try using the razor in the bath tube or in a shower. Afterwards you can rinse the whole tub easier using the hose. You can put one of these cosmetic mirrors with a suction cup on the wall if you need a mirror. Also, if you use the trimmer on wet hair, it will stick together and it won't fly everywhere. You will unfortunately have more work to clean the trimmer. 
How does one efficiently clean-up hair from sink after shaving or trimming beard?
It's not clear whether you're using something electrical which uses the power socket in the bathroom. If not, don't do it over the sink - obviously, wet shaving must be done at the sink, but any trimming can be done elsewhere. Put a towel across your lap and sit at a table with a mirror - that means you can use a dustpan and brush to clear the table and take the towel outside and shake it out.Being female, I manage leg hair standing on a towel (if you're using an epilator, where the hair falls to the nearest flat surface) and shaking that out afterwards. Underarms, I use the electric shaver with a mirror placed behind the loo - I lift the loo seat, look in the mirror and use the shaver, and all the bits drop down the loo, and I just flush it, job done. If I didn't have a shelf behind the loo, I'd use the towel across the lap sitting at a table method instead.
Is there a way that I can stop my hair from moving all day?
A couple of hair grips strategically placed, hair slides, barrette at the back holding it in a 'tail', put it up (french pleat, bun, wrap, whatever) put in a ponytail, plait it - if you're not female, some of these ideas may not be appropriate, although the low ponytail is fine.My hair's long with a fringe, I don't have a problem with it unless I'm working outside in a garden, when I either shove it all up into a baseball cap or use a 'hair grab' to keep it up and out of the way. Hair grabs are wonderful things, easy and quick. Although we all call them hair grabs here, they appear to be listed as 'hair claws or clamps' - banana clips are longer and curved, but similar.
How does one efficiently clean-up hair from sink after shaving or trimming beard?
If the sink is completely dry beforehand, the dry hairs from your mustache & beard shouldn't stick, and a vacuum with a hose (and possibly a brush attachment) should work very effectively.
How does one efficiently clean-up hair from sink after shaving or trimming beard?
I use an electric beard trimmer so I end up shaving over the sink as well.I line the sink with 2-3 paper towels(try to cover the whole surface area of the sink) and wet them. I shave over the sink as best I can although hairs inevitably get elsewhere. After I'm done I throw away the paper towels(along with most of the hair), and then take a wet paper towel and wipe away any remaining hairs. I'd guess the cleaning takes about 3 minutes and it's clean enough my girlfriend doesn't seem to notice or complain.
How does one efficiently clean-up hair from sink after shaving or trimming beard?
Turn on the tap and then with your hand guide and/or throw the stream to the places where there are still hairs. Repeat until clean :)You can use your moist hand to wipe up the loose hairs around the basin. Wash once after, done.Advanced topic: aim for a spiral path for the splashes so they hit more sink surface before returning to the hole in the middle.
I can't stop sneezing
As @Mooseman said, pinching the nose can make the tickling go away. But you should not pinch it as if something smells bad (closing the nostrils), but instead only apply some pressure on both sides of the nose bridge with your fingers so that you still can (could, if you did not have a cold) breathe. You might try a bit to find the right spot, but you will definitely know it as soon as you did!A trick to help sneezing is looking into bright light. Not too bright, of course because you don't want to damage your eyes. This works, because the nerves responsible for the sneezing reflex and the ones for noticing brightness may lay close together in some people. Therefore the brightness signal might "jump over" and intensify the sneezing stimulus which would then finally lead to a relieving sneeze...
Is there a way that I can stop my hair from moving all day?
Collect your hair in a ponytail and band it.  If there are stray hairs remaining that you need to move, either due to short length (don't reach the ponytail) or they go over areas of your face you want uncovered even though they make it to the ponytail, use bobby pins.These can be found in many colors, try to find one that matches your hair color.When you've got the stray hair collected in it, pin it up with hair nearer the top of the head.  If you like, you can hide the pin under some of the hair as well so it's not as obvious that you're using pins, but given the pieces of hair you're moving will be pulled up it'll be clear to an observant person that you're using pins.Another option is the topknot to take care of hair that could end up in your face.  You can put all your hair in the topknot, or leave the back hair hanging.  Alternately, there's no reason you can't have multiple ponytails, or use a style typically associated with women. If you don't want to use a ponytail you can try pinning your front hair back and under your top hair.  This should keep your face a bit more free, but of course it doesn't prevent side or top hair from getting into your face in the wind.
Is there a way that I can stop my hair from moving all day?
If you do not have a super emotional attachment to your hair and its style, then you could always consider mixing things up and going for a trim at the barbers. They might even be able to give you some pointers as to how to prevent your problem next time you go for a clean up.You'd be surprised how nice it is to have short hair - I used to have long(ish) hair and then decided I would get a short back n' sides, and it so much easier to keep control of, no lengthy showers / hair drying, no issue with bed hair, no overheating in Summer, etc...
How does one efficiently clean-up hair from sink after shaving or trimming beard?
I have been cutting my own hair for twenty years, shaving for that long as well, using electric clippers. This is a problem the first few times you perform this task, but it is something where "practice makes perfect". For cutting my hair, I use a plastic bag from the grocery store which fits almost perfectly into the bowl shape of most sinks, and then I shave my head above this plastic bag. For facial hair, I use the same Wahl brand clippers (absolutely the best brand by far) to trim my beard to stubble once every couple of weeks. I can see how a more significant beard would create a situation where you would plug the sink up while trying to wash the hairs down, so for this, I would go with the same plastic bag method. Otherwise, I simply shave with the clippers over the bare sink, and wash down any hair in the sink afterwards. I use a small amount of wet toilet paper to wipe up any stray hairs that inevitably end up outside of the sink itself. Wet is the key word here: It causes the stray hairs to stick to the toilet paper like a magnet, vastly increasing your cleaning efficiency.Like I said, after a few messy experiences using this method (and frankly any and all other methods except perhaps one of those old school FlowBees), you'll get the hang of not making your wife/girlfriend angry when you perform maintenance. Good luck!
How to listen to music in the shower?
I have stumbled across this problem as well, but I don't have speakers. I throw my laptop in the sink and it works surprisingly well. You might be able to do this with your speaker, as the sink makes it quite a bit louder.This is also a completely free option, as it doesn't require you to purchase bags or a shelving unit. Almost every bathroom has a shower already in it :)NOTE: Do not turn the water on! I have almost done this before
How to put a bandaid on the tip of your finger
If you use extra wide bandaids, you stick the bandaid lengthways along the front and back of your finger. The sides of the bandaid will wrap around the sides of your finger and stick to each other. 
How do I remove hard-to-remove ink from my hands?
This might work:Try hairspray. This is said to leave stickiness, but it works.Any alcohol based products, even hand disinfectant.  Finishing with a soap rinse works to.Dishsoap. This works pretty good, but the thick ones meant for extra cleaning.Using nail polish remover works, but make sure to wash your hands afterward really good.Additional Info Mixing soaps you use with salt or baking soda to make a exfoliant like scrub works.Also, trying baby oil may work. 
How to put a bandaid on the tip of your finger
From Instructables:Take a bandaid and cut the ends up to the gauze in half. Then lay the bandaid flat and put the finger on it wrapping the wings around it. Do it to both sides of the bandaid and then it should fit on your finger like a little hat.Make sure the finger, scissors and bandaid are clean. Use disinfectants and cut the bandaid in the package.
How does one efficiently clean-up hair from sink after shaving or trimming beard?
I use a small rectangular plastic bag with:The length side split approximately half way down.Place it in the sink and all your trimmings fall into the open bag.When you're done you simply lift the bag and give it a jiggle on anangle and all the trimmings fall into the bottom corner.The small trimmings form a nice neat ball which rolls out of the bagand into the garbage.Keep the bag for next time!  No need to waste water, clog your pipesand make a mess with towels and the like!TADA!
How does one efficiently clean-up hair from sink after shaving or trimming beard?
I shave with clippers every other week or so and it gets everywhere around the sink. What I use to clean the sink and surrounding counter area is a bit unique; you know how in a pack of, say, NyQuil capsules, there's an "empty" square in the middle? Save this piece and use it as a scraper to scrape everything into your sink. If stuff is sticking to the sink wall, this piece should be stiff enough to scrape it out. When you're done, just rinse it off and throw it back in your drawer.
I can't stop sneezing
A few years ago I fell down a hole hurting my kidneys and God knows what else (nothing serious). Anyway due to the trauma, I experienced hard pain when I was walking and every time I sneezed pain was incredible. After few days I learned to control sneezing. The trick is to focus on sneezing, take one large breath and freeze instantly (do not move). Now, I had to learn this because of the pain, but if you ask me you don't need to put that much effort in order to control sneezing. Like others have mentioned it will only last a day or so.One other thing that is significant. You said that you are only sneezing and haven't mentioned other cold symptoms. Maybe you are allergic to something (it's not important how old are you and if this is the first time you have these symptoms) in which case you should see a doctor.
How to quickly cure headaches without medicine
I find that regulating the blood to the brain helps with some headache causes. Something like:Putting a slight pressure on both temples and holding that for 1 minute on, 1 minute off helps.Placing your index finger and thumb on the bridge of your nose (there's a small blood vessel on either side, I believe)Other than that, though as others have said, water (sips, not gulps) helps.
How does one efficiently clean-up hair from sink after shaving or trimming beard?
I can understand your desire to focus on cleanup and not prevention! When I trim my beard I use a large round plastic bucket with a rope handle that completely covers not only the sink but a few inches (5 cm) on either side, and I still find hairs in the sink afterwards which must be cleaned up. It sounds like the solutions you have tried involve getting the hairs out of the sink and surrounding areas.  My solution is just the opposite - I simply wash the hairs down the drain.  They are very short and not long enough to stick together and clog up the drain, and it is much quicker and cleaner than trying to keep them out of the drain.  If you have a lot of hair in the sink you might be more reluctant about using this method, but it does work quite well if it's only a little hair.
How to get air tight seals on canisters?
Place a sheet of plastic wrap over the container before placing the lid on top. This will meet between the rubber and the container to ensure an air-tight seal.
How to get air tight seals on canisters?
If you're primarily drawn to these canisters because they look nice, you could put things in Ziploc bags and put the bags into the containers.  (Just like breakfast cereal: it's usually in a more airtight plastic bag, inside a sturdier, decorative box.)A similar approach, which I don't like as much, is to buy smaller hermitic containers that fit inside the decorative brass ones, and store the contents in the smaller containers which are then inside the brass containers.
How to quickly whiten teeth
Try lemon juice and baking soda. Mix together and apply to teeth. Rinse off after a little while and don't use too frequently as this may cause tooth damage as any acids aren't good for teeth. But if you use very little lemon it should be alright. Try using peroxide which is an ingredient of many teeth products. Brush and rinse with it, rinse cleanly. And don't use to often, it is actually a bleaching agent for hair and etc, but use in moderation. 
How Can I Fix a Broken Fly? (As in "Pants" not "Insects")
Solutions:Sew a few stitches into the pants where the zipper is. This keeps the zipper together, but is hard to take apart for bathroom breaks or generally to change them if you have tight pants. If you have loose pants or wear a belt then the pants will be turned into slipons. There are 2 way I can think of doing this:Do a whipstitich or other stitch to the zipper while the zipper apparatus is still there. A Whipstitch or blanket stitch may be to bulky and you may opt for another stitch. Remove the Zipper by the stitches that hold it into the pants or just try cutting it out. Then just sew the left over flaps together so it looks like it was meant to be that way.Use a safety pin. Using a large diaper pin or several safety pins would keep them together and these can be reused. Be careful when adding then though, you can sick yourself if you are not careful. Change the zipper. Buy or "borrow" one from other pants. Zippers are not to expensive and can be found in other pants, so if you wore out some pants, you have a zipper. Wear a longer shirt. This makes sure the problem isn't shown, as the shirt will cover the zipper and the problem. Avoid bending backward and winds that will blow up the shirt.  Alternative SolutionDon't wear zipper pants. If you wear elastic and other pants, and not zipper pants then your fly will not wear out. Change the zipper to elastic. If you proactively change the zipper, then the problem is avoided. Lifeacker.com on ways to fix a broken zipper. You can go to a tailor other clothes fixers and have them fix it for you. They can also probably do other repairs such as fix holes adjust pants length.Alternatives to sewing are sticky sewing adhesives that can be Ironed or applied with other heat. These adhesives may work better as it allows a person to take something a loose more and may be easier for people without sewing skills.   
How to set effective long-term reminders?
Something tells me you have already forgotten this one so here are some tips to help you not forget again:Set an alarm on your watch/phone for the last month Additionally set multiple alarms on your computer for the last month Use one or two online calendars/reminders to notify you by email in the last month Tell a friend to remind you of it in the last month If you have some seasonal stuff you are not going to look at before the last month, attach a note to some of it. i.e. put a note on the Christmas decorationsBuy yourself a calendar and make big mark in it (and if you can't buy the 2016 calendar now, buy a 2015 calendar and make a reminder to buy a new one and to mark it) Place the calendar somewhere you'll keep looking at it If you implement some of or all of these, you should have a lot of different independent triggers where some of them, at least, should be able to warn you ahead of the deadline!The main point I'm trying to make is not to put all your eggs (or  alarms so to speak) in the same basket. Using multiple triggers increases the possibility for you to be properly warned.
How to vacuum stairs with minimal effort?
I don't have any experience with upright vacuums, but have successfully used regular vacuums in stairs. My tip is to use hold/carry the vacuum in one hand, and then use it with a half-length (or compressed) pipe with maybe a smaller nozzle attachment to get into corners.Image, from wikimedia, shows small vacuum with shorter pipe, but regular nozzle. These are easily carried in a stair.
How to get air tight seals on canisters?
I understand your question to if it is possible to modify an arbitrary copper cannister to be air right. That is a rather large question...Depending on your skills and how nice you want it to look I'd say: Yes, to some extent and to a certain level of air tight.To me the easiest and prettiest method would be to line the lid or the top of the cannister with tape or rubber of some sort if they are too wide.If you use a flexible liner material it will be quite air tight, and you could possibly get it even better using the plastic wrap tip from another answer.
How Can I Fix a Broken Fly? (As in "Pants" not "Insects")
Old fashioned diaper (nappy in the UK) pins, the kind you can lock closed. You'll look like a nutter, but probably marginally less so than constantly walking around with an open fly, and at least you won't be risking prosecution for inadvertent flashing. If you can't be bothered to buy new clothes, take your pants with broken zippers to the cleaners (they also do repairs) and get them to put new zips in. It's a trial, but easier than looking for new clothes.
How Can I Fix a Broken Fly? (As in "Pants" not "Insects")
A common method I used a lot when I was in boarding school, when my zipper broke was to make a cut across the bottom of the teeth on the side where the zipper separated from, this effectively makes the zip work like the zips on hoodies where you have to push one end through the zip before you zip it.At times after doing this, this zip would move up and down but not zip the pants closed, at this point I usually use my teeth to bite the zip to make it smaller, and when that fails, I usually remove the zip from my moist, miserable pants, and make a second cut on the other zip teeth to replace the zip.
Is there a way that I can stop my hair from moving all day?
Use a men's hair band or tie a bandana (head band).
I can't stop sneezing
This method stops my sneezes 100% of the time. I hold my index finger above my lip, as if I were imitating a mustache, and press inward and upward on my nasal septum. Keep your finger there with applied pressure until the sensation subsides. 
How to quickly whiten teeth
I did it with baking soda and mixed in water to create a thick paste. Then apply to toothbrush and apply. You will not see and instant whiteness but you will definitely feel the clean feeling afterwards. Don't do more than 2-3 times a month. Perhaps consider an enamel repair toothpaste to use at the same time to counteract any damage you might be doing. 
How to set effective long-term reminders?
I thought of something that would be very useful for my specific case. Reminders should be somewhere you're already checking everyday out of habit. For some, this would be their physical calendar at home, for others (like me), their email accounts.So I checked for tools that can send delayed emails and I found Boomerang for Gmail.With this, I could send myself emails dated whenever I want to receive them, so I'll be able to give myself reminders via delayed emails.@holroy's answer is spot-on, and I believe redundancy is key. I just thought this would help other people as well. I am not affiliated with Boomerang in any way.
Removing and restoring stickers/decals
Unfortunately, no.Stickers -- especially old stickers -- only stick once. This is because they are either 1) not sticky enough or 2) pull fibers from the present backing making the surface no longer sticky. Even if you were able to get the stickers to peel off, they'd be curled beyond repair.
Removing and restoring stickers/decals
Using the steam from a kettle will loosen the stickers enough for you to slowly and carefully peel them off.As soon as you get them off I would try to keep them straight so they don’t dry all crinkled and twisted.Be very careful. If you steam them for too long you may ruin the finish on them.
How Can I Fix a Broken Fly? (As in "Pants" not "Insects")
Cover the broken zipper with an apron or other view obstructing device. If your job allows you to wear something like this, then the problem can be hidden.
What's the most time efficient way to completely clean teeth?
A water-pick is helpful for me, though I don't know if it saves time for the "same amount" of cleaning compared to a toothbrush.
What's the most time efficient way to completely clean teeth?
"Properly" is the key word here, because the devil is in the details. If you were to go directly to a dentist with this question, they would undoubtedly tell you that there is no real alternative to spending the appointed time with good old toothpaste and tooth brush, not to mention a thorough flossing to boot!I'll be the first to admit that I have previously been known to do a quick once-over with a toothbrush without any toothpaste, but it turns out that this practice is likely to cause micro-scratches in the enamel of one's teeth--just the thing, as long as you want to help stains and food particles to stick to your teeth in the long run.I'll also speak for the crowd and say that flossing is the natural first sacrifice that folks tend to make when they're in a hurry, and this is a fairly okay option from time to time, as long as you don't make a habit of it. If you're the sort of person who would otherwise forget about flossing altogether, then it would even be advisable to go as far as setting yourself an alarm to force it into your schedule every now and then.As far as time efficiency goes, mouthwash is your best friend; the time used for swishing is ideal for multitasking, as the rest of your body is completely free in the meantime. Whatever else you need to get done in that same time frame-- get dressed, use the bathroom, take a shower, throw a bagel in the toaster-- time spent rinsing with mouthwash need not count against your busy schedule, and so I would always make sure to do this.On the subject of plain old brushing (with toothpaste, or a water pik, or one of those disposable on-the-go brushes, or whatever), there is an obvious time tradeoff available: how long is long enough? The answer is pretty much up to you. You should never skip this step altogether if you can possibly help it, but the exact duration is less important than the fact of brushing (all surfaces, not just the easy-to-reach ones) in the first place. If you also use mouthwash, for example, then it may be justifiable to reduce your brush time when you're in a hurry-- as long as you still make sure to spend the time to do a thorough job whenever you aren't in a hurry (especially if you've recently eaten sugary and/or acidic foods like fruit, sweets, soda, and juice).The big takeaway:Dental health, much like dietary habits and many other things, is all about moderation. As long as you still keep up good habits in the long run, you can get away with minor discrepancies every now and then; and vice versa, if you're going to take shortcuts every now and then, that makes it all the more important that you keep up good habits in the long run.P.S. While I'm at it, here's a bonus protip for you:Follow your consumption of sugary, acidic, or staining food and drink (sweets, fruit, soda, juice, coffee, tea, you name it) with a glass of uncarbonated water or milk, or by chewing a piece of sugarfree gum! Each of these will help to neutralize, dilute, and rinse away the offending substances, and thereby reduce the amount of erosion and/or staining that can occur. 
Removing and restoring stickers/decals
You could spend some time cutting around the edges with an x-acto knife. This would be time consuming, and it wouldn't restore them to their original state, but it would at least leave them able to be put somewhere else using double-sided tape or whatever.
How Can I Fix a Broken Fly? (As in "Pants" not "Insects")
If you can't insert a new zip yourself, take your trousers to a specialist and have a new zip put in. It's a lot cheaper than you think.Sometimes dry-cleaning shops offer this service, sometimes you see small ads for garment repairs or alteration. As a matter of fact it is so cheap I feel quite guilty about it, but the seamstresses are very pleased to get the money.
How to quickly straighten a tooth
This is probably not what you want to hear, but I do not believe it is possible, at least not in a safe and healthy way!The way that orthodontic braces work is by applying a force to your teeth, such that the teeth loosen slowly over time, and new bone growth forms around the new, slightly altered position, which is also a very slow process.
How to quickly straighten a tooth
There is no quick way of straighten a tooth and obviously not in a week. Don't attempt any teeth-straightening on your own as you can risk a pain or further complications without necessary knowledge. This require training and long-term practice. If this would be so simple, orthodontist wouldn't study that topic.If your tooth is slightly twisted, there is some reason for it. Either you've another tooth either underneath (you can't know that without a proper X-Ray) or next to it or there is no really space for your tooth (and you need a palatal spreader to widen the upper jaw), or there is some potential complication and you can end up with dental extraction. So make sure that you make an appointment with your your orthodonist before making a decision. There is no better person who can tell you the options than your orthodontist (always be open for a second opinion).Today, one of the most popular options for realigning teeth (excempt traditional braces) is to use a clear retainer or brace appliance (such as Invisalign, Damon System, etc.). Or you can get a holding arch to prevent teeth from shifting.If you're looking for any brace-less techniques, the only one is by gently massaging the teeth and gums every day in intended direction. However if you're not confident, please consult that with your orthodontist.See also:How to Straighten Your Teeth Without Braces at wikiHow
What's the most time efficient way to completely clean teeth?
Here are the methods which can efficiently clean your teeth as part of your dental care:Brush your teeth with toothpaste for two minutes (at least 1h after eating) including outer/inner teeth  surface and against the gumline (sweep or roll the brush away from the gumline).Use dental floss after brushing to remove plaque between teeth and under the gum line, where ordinary toothbrushes can't reach.Use mouthwash liquid which can kill 99.9% of bacteria and provides protection against plaque (such as Listerine). Alternatively use water or an acid-neutralizing mixture (one part baking soda, eight parts water).Add some sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), it's used as an ingredient in some mouthwashes for a better whitening, acid neutralizer and plaque removal. Toothpaste containing sodium bicarbonate has in several studies shown to have a better whitening and plaque removal effect than toothpastes without itwiki. There is no harm in using excess of sodium bicarbonate.It works as a mechanical cleanser on the teeth and gums, neutralizes the production of acid in the mouth and also as an antiseptic to help prevent infections occurring. (p. 47, Cloth Diapers by Donald C. Cooper Ph.D.)You may also add activated charcoal powder onto your toothpaste. It absorbs toxins, a wide variety of drugs, chemicals and other impurities.Never brush immediately after an acidic meal or drink. Always wait at least 30 minutes.It is recommended to brush your teeth at least 1h after eating or drinking acidic foods/drinks to prevent chance of enamel erosion and dental erosion which can damage your teeth. So brushing too soon after meals and drinks can do more harm than good. See: Really? Never Brush Your Teeth Immediately After a MealAfter your last teeth brushing, avoid eating and drink only plain water (maintaining the right pH and °C in the mouth can prevent a dental plaque, which can help saliva to naturally neutralize the acids produced by the bacteria and remineralize the tooth surface).You may use Plaque Disclosing gel or Disclosing tablets which can dramatically highlights harmful bacterial plaque on tooth surfaces and shows the areas where more brushing and flossing are required. See: Detection of plaque build up.If your whitening toothpaste isn't working, try leaving it on your teeth for a couple of minutes before you rinst it off.
What's the most time efficient way to completely clean teeth?
I'd argue about the recommended use of dental floss - my dentist refers to it as 'cheese cutter wire' claiming it commonly causes cuts in gums between teeth. I've certainly experienced that myself.It should take you 4 minutes of brushing with toothpaste if you have all your teeth still, then that needs to be followed up with the small, inter dental brushes (Tepe is the best known make) in between the teeth, at the gum margin both sides of each tooth, where there are gaps. These come in different sizes, but younger people (below, say, 40) often find even the smallest one is too large for the gaps, so they have to stick to dental floss, despite the dangers. It's quite surprising, after a good brushing, to discover small particles of food still being removed by the interdental brushes... follow up with mouthwash if you must, though its not essential, but preferably an alcohol free one. Check also that the mouthwash you choose can be used directly after toothpaste or whether you need to wait a while - products like Corsodyl neutralise the good effects of toothpaste, and toothpaste neutralises Corsodyl, if used within half an hour of brushing. Note that consistent use of strong mouthwash can cause an imbalance of flora within the mouth, causing possible fungal and other infections to occur.In terms of time management, doing what I've described properly before bed is best -if you can't manage this any other time of day, it'll be okay, so long as you reserve that 10 minutes at bed time for this routine. Bloomin' tedious though...I tend to take the tablet into the bathroom and watch something while I'm doing this procedure, or I'm likely to become impatient and take shortcuts...
Fast and Easy way to put a belt on
I don't think you'll be able to solve this without additional tools (plus you tagged it with substitute tools), so I've come up with a device which should solve your problem.You'll require some string, and a collar. You'll want to tie the string around the collar, and then put the collar on your neck. When you need to put a belt on someone, you tie the string around one of the "hoops" in their pants you put a belt through. This device will hold the pants up for you without requiring you to use your hands (since your neck is holding it up). You'll need to make sure the string is long enough so you can get around the person, but short enough that it'll hold up the belt (if it's too short, the pants will just fall to the ground). The exact length is a matter of personal preference, so I'd suggest experimenting to see what you like best. Having varying lengths of string tied to the collar would be a good idea too, so that you have different strings for different sizes of people.
Fast and Easy way to put a belt on
I think you need to add a tool as you only have two arms of given length. (And growing a third arm isn't really feasible :), ref  Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy)My suggestion is therefore to put the belt in the pants beforehand and use suspenders with alligator claws to hold the pants up while you buckle the pants. Remove suspenders afterwards as there is no need for both belt and suspenders, and it's, supposedly, against  the fashion rules for men.
How can I safely sanitise my smartphone's display?
If the screen itself is not greasy or visibly soiled then you should just wipe it down with a microfiber cloth. If the cloth is clean the screen will be clean. Clean the cloth though sometimes, I usually clean it with water, but mild soap without buildup should work.For greasy or just dirty screens:Slightly damp microfiber cloths will work. You can dampen the cloth with saline or a mild eyeglass cleaner. This is what I do.Things to avoid: Anything wet in the phone's openings.Alcohol products. Hydrogen Peroxide,  vinegar, etc.These are just some things that can damage your screen.Long term solutions:Buy a case and/or screen protector. This makes sure that your phone screen is protected, and you can use other cleaning products on it. As a plus, most cases have a built in screen protector. Cases also protect against phone breakage and sometimes water damage.
How can I safely sanitise my smartphone's display?
I use Xpro screen clean on mine - comes in a kit with a microfibre cloth and a dusting brush. Doesn't contain alcohol, and I don't use it very often, finding the microfibre cloth does most of the time, and I use a stylus on screen and not my fingers anyway. I clean the other parts (back and sides) carefully with anti bacterial wipes, the sort you might use on your bathroom sink or loo, and I use those to clean the stylus too.
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
In times of need I have heard that dish soap can unclog the toilet. I have no idea how, or why anyone even thought of it, but it's worth a try. If you're constantly getting clogged toilets, it might be best to just call out a plumber and get your pipes looked at.
Preventing soap from slipping in washbasin
Clean thoroughly the area where you want to leave the soap.  When it's clean (and absolutely dry) take a cocktail stick and put tiny dots of white uPVC sealant on the shelved area. (Don't try to apply it direct from the sealant gun they'll be much too big and they'll be visible.) The dots give friction which hold the soap from slipping.You can flatten the dots very carefully with a wetted finger.  Leave to dry overnight. I did this to my washbasin several months ago and to my surprise the dots are still there despite the usual regular cleaning routine.
Ant Chalk Cleanup
You can do what you have been doing with a few alternations:used latex gloves, a good cloth, water/soap and wiped the floor cleanSome other added methods:Utilize proper ventilation and use masks, so that this dust does not damage your lungs. Use suction, i.e. a vaccuum cleaner with nozzle  and proper filter to suck up the bulk. This also can grab the dust in the crevices. Use a brush to loosen any particles that may be residing deeper or just need some friction to be removed. To vacuum while brushing also helps. Change water frequently so that you do not wipe the dust back onto the floor. 
Removing Ring From Finger
I have always done something I found on Lifehacker a while back. You will need an elastic band (like a rubber band, but stretchy fabric works better) and tweezers. Get the elastic band and wrap it around your finger tightly up until the ring. Now, using the tweezers, grab the end of the band and pull it under the ring. Now, you can just grab the part of the band that unwrap it from your finger.Article
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
If a toilet clogs very often, it is a sign of it being filled with water sediments. This is the case with most of the old toilets and in the areas with hard water.You should remove the toilet and manually clean it from the other side of the pipe. You'll probably need a hammer and/or some other tool to break the sediments. The easier way is to change the toilet for a new one.A toilet without any blockage should never clog unless you put in there something that should not go there. 
Removing Ring From Finger
A jewelry store was able to remove my wedding ring over a swollen knuckle using a copious spray of Windex (sorry if that sounds like a Big Fat Greek Wedding joke!). I've also successfully used an ice-cold water bath and dish-soap on less-stuck rings.Good luck!
How to dye eggs without food dye?
In my family, we never used artificial colored dyes.  Instead, we took the leftover onion peels in the pantry, wrapped them around the eggs and boiled them.The downside of this is you do need to plan in advance a little as you need to have raw eggs and you end up coloring them while you hard boil them.  If the eggs are cooked, you really can't do this unless you want to cook the eggs again.  You also have to have a sufficient quantity of onion peels laying around.The basic steps are:Wet everything downWrap the egg in the onion peel.Secure it with a rubber bandHard boil the egg.Depending how you wrap them, you'll end up with a very nice marbled look that varies in color depending on what kind of onions you use.  We typically have yellow onions, so I know the will give you a red-brown color.  I have never tried it with any other color of onion, so I can't speak for the coloring with them and if it would be any different.
How to dye eggs without food dye?
We can use any kind of natural vegetable dye sources we may find in our kitchen or garden as egg shells easily take up the color from them.All natural dyes have in common to boil the eggs together with the vegetables. Some vinegar added as a fixative to the water may help to make the color last longer.Brown to red: outer onion peels of brown Spanish onions.Natural red: peels of red onions, red cabbage, red wineBright red/pink: beetroot piecesYellow: carrots, turmeric spiceGreen: parsley, spinachIn case we need the eggs to have more than a solid color I found that wrapping small leaves or early spring flowers tightly around the eggs using nylons before cooking them in the dye gives very beautiful results: 
Removing Ring From Finger
Try several methods:Take grease, such as mineral oil, olive oil or other loose oils and soak the finger in it. Twist the ring gently and try to slip it up the finger.Also, raising your arm for a while can help the ring get off, this helps if it is a medical problem, as well. Soaking the hand in cool water, also helps, as it helps to resize the ring. Doing multiple methods helps if the ring just won't come off. Warning:The ring may have to be cut if:It has been on the finger for a while and the finger grew into the small ring.Or the finger is swollen and the ring is constricting. This may cause you to loose your finger if you don't remove the ring. Don't discount cutting the ring off as a method. Rings can be fixed as good as new and the ring can be cut from the back. After removing the ring to avoid this issue, buy larger rings and utilize ring resizers. Try the Floss method. This method I have not really tried, so it may or my not work. 
Ηow can I keep my jeans' zippers from unzipping on their own?
If your pants button and the zipper are magnetic, you might want to magnetize both by swiping them with a strong magnet ~100 times. This will cause them to stick to each other, but can be still removed when you pull on them.
How can I get rid of large amounts of cardboard boxes
You can use them as makeshift bins to put boxes and other trash until you finally be able to throw them out.
Removing Ring From Finger
If your finger is swollen or just too big, cutting it off is your only option. If it's only just a little too small, try soaking your hand in ice water as long as you can. This will cause your skin to shrink a little bit but not much. Then, soap your hand thoroughly and try to take the ring off. While soaping make sure to spin the ring and get the soap water underneath the ring. This is clean and works as well or better than oils for me. If you need steps like these, do not put the ring back on until either your finger is smaller or the ring has been resized to fit properly. 
Eye strain due to fluorescent lights
Cover it with the film used to coat car windows. It will prevent the UV light from reaching and slightly dim it, keeping its intensity.
How Can I Fix a Broken Fly? (As in "Pants" not "Insects")
The only solution that makes sense:Take these pants to a seamstress or cobbler shop. For $5-25 you'll have your problem solved in 1 to 2 days.Once you start using these services you'll kick yourself for not frequenting them sooner in life.
Eye strain due to fluorescent lights
Put on sunglasses ... unless that is considered "reducing the intensity of light". I wasn't sure if you meant "reducing the intensity of light" for other people in the room, or for you.
Eye strain due to fluorescent lights
The eyestrain may be caused by flicker rather than by the type of light itself.  Most fluorescent lights flicker at the same rate of your AC power - generally 50 or 60 times per second.  Replacing the ballast with a high-frequency electronic ballast will make the flicker undetectable to your eyes.  Modern compact fluorescent lights are generally in this high frequency range.  If you get eyestrain even with CFLs, then it is probably caused by the color temperature or the intensity of the light, and a high-frequency ballast for a traditional tube isn't likely to help.Is the reason you are "supposed to receive direct fluorescent tube light" a medical reason?  If so, consult with the same doctor before attempting to fix the eyestrain or you may inadvertently remove the intended benefit.  Find out which components are beneficial (frequency, color temperature, and/or intensity), and then maybe you can alter the remaining traits.
Is there a non-mechanical solution to unclogging a sink drain?
A large quantity of boiling water sometimes works.  I usually avoid chemicals because they often cause wear and tear on the pipes (depends on the chemicals and the pipes but don't trust the advertised claims).  A leaky pipe is a much bigger problem than a clogged pipe.
Removing Ring From Finger
It is completely possible to remove the ring by using some string/dental floss. I've seen it done personally before.The way to achieve this is by wrapping the string around the finger just before the ring, then push the string under and through the ring, then simply pull the string from the side where you pushed it through to (essentially unraveling it), and the ring should come off. You could aid this my adding the slightest drop of olive oil/lubricant.You can see it in action by watching this Youtube videoString the floss under the ring, and wrap it around your finger. Then,  unwind the floss to move the ring up your finger.SourceThis is commonly referred to as the Floss Method

Is it possible to make stiff cables and wires flexible again?
Try to avoid temperature changes to the rubber, because that is what is most likely causes it's stiffness. By heat changes I mean seasonal heat and coolings. This sourceand I don't exactly agree, but it may help you find a solution.Also, if placing the cords in a stable environment won't work. Then trying to stop them from coiling by wrapping floss around them, hanging them up or etc may help.A solution?Try to move them as much as possible while in a heated environment. This seemed to work for me, probably as the heat made the rubber relax. They usually stay pretty not  stiff if I continuously use them after this and try to keep the mobil.

Huge noise in my inkjet printer
Insulators will certainly help.Try wrapping the noisy parts with a blanket or noise-reducing mats and taping them there to reduce noise. A sound-reducing blanket could look like this:Attaches with Velcro, so your printer won't look so weird with all the tape... Amazon will probably sell some stuff that are flexible and can reduce noise. Using insulators like blankets should help you out. A giant jacket could cover the entire printer, just open the zipper to get the papers out of there.Otherwise, you could buy a newer printer that is quieter. 
Stopping My Burning Tongue
It depends on base chemistry of the spicy.Oil BasedWater BasedOil based, chili peppers and such, really require a soluble liquid to wash them off the surface of your tongue.

Huge noise in my inkjet printer
Instead of making the output directly to paper, you could set up a PDF printer and make the printout at midnight go to the PDF printer. And then you could make the paper output at daytime not disturbing your guests. (Or even better, just store the PDF output and save paper :-) )
Stopping My Burning Tongue
'Curd' does the magic. Cover your entire tongue using chilled curd, as it reduces the burning sensation for moment and if you repeat this couple of times with fresh curd, that sensation disappears easily. I did this couple of times at my grandma's house. 
Stopping My Burning Tongue
One of the best ways I have found for easing the effect of Capsaicin (the active component of chili peppers) exposure is NOT by drinking water (all this does is spread the oils around the mouth more which will make the burning sensation worse)What works for me is actually a spoonful (teaspoon NOT tablespoon) of granulated cane sugar.Some background to why this works: The Scoville scale uses a sugar solution in order to dilute the capsaicin solution until the heat is no longer detected.Therefore it stands to reason that sugar (or a sugar syrup) will be helpful in negating the effects when your mouth is burning.
How to have cross ventilation in a single window room?
All the above answers were great and would work for most people but not for me. Here's why:Ice bucket method: I have a  that produces 1 tumbler worth of ice cubes at a time. By the time I actually fill up a small bucket I would have consumed a lot of power and time, thus this method is impractical for me.Door open method: I have already stated in question that opening the door blocks out both outgoing air and light towards window. So that wont do.Camp bed method: I already have a bed and cant afford to buy a camp bed which is really expensive if available in India. There is no such thing as camping in our city-living actually.Although nobody suggested this but offline a friend did, what about using a cooler like this:Nope, takes too much precious floor space in my already small room.I ended up buying the tower fan and its awesome! I put it near my door with the fan facing me and the back of the fan faces towards the window. This does pull in cool air well.So anyone having a similar room layout as me and limited options, a tower fan has worked for me and you might want to consider it too!
How to open a beverage can that has a broken tab?
I would strongly advise against using sharp objects (like screwdrivers) to make a hole that is different in shape from the intended opening. It could result in small bits of aluminium (that the can is made of) falling into the contents, and possibly cause harm if ingested.Just simulate the usual way of opening cans using a spoon handle or a similar non-sharp object in the same motion as the original tab.
How to open a beverage can that has a broken tab?
Using force is always an option. :)Seriously, though, the main thing you want to avoid is squeezing the can while you are opening it, or you will have a mess.  Aim for the perforations with a screwdriver or a spoon and you should be able to ease it open.
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?

Faster ways of placing cans in the fridge?
I'll assume the 12-pack is in a cardboard box.Get a cutting board or some similar sturdy, flat rectangle.Turn the 12-pack upside down on a table.Tear off the bottom piece of cardboard (which is pointing at the ceiling).Put the cutting board on top of the exposed can-bottoms.Holding the cutting board in place with one hand, flip the 12-pack of cans over on top of it.Tear the back off of the cardboard case, but keep the front and the 2 sides intact.Walk them over to the fridge and put the cutting board on the shelf.Slide the cutting board out from underneath the cans by putting your hand against the front of the box and pushing towards the back of the fridge.Pull the cardboard box off of the cans.The cans won't all be "staged" like they are in your photo, with labels pointing towards the front. And the width of the cutting board may prevent you from placing ALL the cans on the shelf this way (because the cutting board will bump into cans you already placed on the shelf). But at least this will let you move 12 cans at a time!
Faster ways of placing cans in the fridge?
For the 2x6 boxes that soda cans tend to come in, you can open one end of the box and tear the flap off that is closest to the bottom of the cans.

What is a permanent solution for black mold?
I have the same problem and I have tried with white vinegar and after several months bleach spray for mold removing (which is not exactly a lifehack but works). The spray works better for me, but smells bad and it is very toxic.I have made a little research and I found the following strategy:clean the surface with bleach sprayclean the spray with spongedry the surfaceapply a special anti-mold basispaint over it as you add to the paint special chemical against mold (containing some kind of preservatives, anti fungi chemicals, or silver ions)some cons of this method are:it uses harmful chemicalsshould not be used if the moisture comes from the wallIf the moisture comes from the wall first you have to make proper isolation.If the moisture comes from the air then you have to reduce air humidity (ventilation, electric dehumidifier). Find the source of humidity and remove it. Sources of humidity can be household activities such as cooking, washing; big plants; water leakage due to plumbing problem somewhere in the house.

Is it possible to make stiff cables and wires flexible again?
There are products called rubber rejuvenators.  I believe they include solvents and oily plasticisers that try to correct for what may have been lost over the years.They are often used on magnetic tape recorder pinch rollers and office printer paper pick-up rollers.Some materials they will not work on and others they will destroy (sometimes after a delay of days or weeks) so test them on a small area first and then try treating one controller at a time to learn which ones respond well.The factory and added plasticisers may also react aggressively towards some plastics so you may be better served with keeping the wires away from the controllers at least for long enough to have no residue left on the wires.One functional way of storing cables is to coil them loosely around your hand, grab the coil into a bundle and push it into a toilet paper core.
How can I keep 2 blankets together on a bed?
Flannel duvet cover with multiple blanketsIn the past, I used a (flannel) duvet cover containing a (down) comforter and one or two (army surplus) wool blankets as upper layers.As long as you fill it by initially stacking all of the blankets and pushing each set of corners into place as if they were one blanket, you can use a fair number. But they should all be as close to the duvet's dimensions as possible.Once together, they only need to be handled slightly differently than a single blanket while making the bed. (You should hold two corners and their contents quite firmly as you throw the duvet across the bed.)

Is it possible to make stiff cables and wires flexible again?
You can try the hair dryer trick, which basically heats up the insulation and resets the rubber's "memory" but this might make it more brittle in the long run.  I find that the natural oils from handling the cables tends to keep them supple.There's a similar discussion at this radio restoration forum. If you know an electrician or network installer, you can try some of their wire pulling lubricant to see if it has any lasting benefit.  The risk of dissolving the insulation is less than with rubber rejuvenator.  In general, try the mildest remedies first.
A trick to make bulk erasable handwritten notes on traditional paper and in books?
Try using an electric eraser.  Borrow one from your artist/architect buddy.  It's basically a cross between those white eraser sticks and a drill.  They work great on pencil, erasable pen, and some more permanent types of media.  It will still require some time, but not nearly as much as a manual eraser.These videos reviews a few different models.  This should give you an idea of how they operate.  I have the corded model he shows at the end of part 1.  I lucked out and found it at a thrift store for about $5, and it suits my needs well.Part 1: https://youtu.be/jzFGb5YE3bgPart 2: https://youtu.be/AWhOKS4UwiE
Removing and restoring stickers/decals
Tools:Get a heat gun (some auto parts stores will rent you one) A straight edge razor Non-stick paper (like the original backing of the sticker, craft stores will have)Action:Put the heat gun on the lowest setting and hold at least 6"s from the sticker. Wave the heat gun in a side to side motion until you can feel that the sticker is very warm. Using the razor, gently try to slide the blade under the edges of the sticker, lifting them from the base. Repeat until you can get your thumb and pointer fingers firmly on the edges. Use your heat gun with one hand and start slowly lifting the sticker with the other. Hold the heat gun at a safe distance from your hand and keep waving left to right. Once sticker, is removed, place on non-stick paper.Good Luck!!!

A trick to make bulk erasable handwritten notes on traditional paper and in books?
Heat sensitive eraseable pen and a clothes ironTools:Eraseable pen that erases by the heat of friction, (the manufacturer of my pen's claims 65oC.)Standard clothes iron set on high.A blank sheet of printer paper. (To protect the iron from any ink as it becomes visible if exposed to cold temperatures.)Procedure:Once the iron has heated up, place the paper over a page and go quickly over it as if you are ironing it, about 2-3 pages deep are reliably erased, while sections you covered less begin to appear a few pages down.Results:It took about 10 minutes to erase the 50 or so pages I'd filled in a 180 page workbook. It looked like the page may become too warped by the heat, but they seemed acceptable/normal range of my other used books afterwards. On inspection, I missed 1 page fully and some corners of 3 other pages. Other ink, pen and pencil notes were unaffected.Disadvantages:Some Page BucklingSome visible scratches from the pen remain (tried 2 versions of the pens)Limited availability of the heat based eraseable pens. (Are they still under patent?)Alternate heating methods:Laminator- really cool and unlikely to set paper on fire without a manufacturer's defect, but only useful for loose leaf paper. (I tested this first to make sure there is a safe temperature for the entire page that reliably erases all the ink.)Blow dryer- mine seems to max out right around 65oC since it just disappeared in spots, but it looks like a hotter dryer or a heat gun with a paper safe setting would be almost as easy with some finer control.Oven- I've decided not to try this for for now though my oven does go down to as low as 50oC so it should be possible to do safely.

Now you fill your mouth with a little bit of air from your lungs, then start breathing in through your nose and pushing the air out of your mouth with your cheeks. Maybe you have seen a "very cool" smoker one day who does this trick where he has the smoke coming out his mouth and going back in his nose. This is basically the same what you have to do. It might take some time to master this, but once you know how to do it you can check your breath in very little time and without any other equipment. You can even do it in public, as long as you're not really talking to someone, no one will really notice... 
What to do in the event of a car accident?
There may be specific laws in your area so they are worth looking up, but in general if you are not on private property you call the police so they can document the accident and take witness statements. You also exchange insurance information so that you can get your vehicles fixed. On private property you notify the owner and they can decide if the police should be involved. Also, if there are injuries then call your local emergency number, 911 in the states, to get help. 
How to put a bandaid on the tip of your finger
I wrap the band-aid over the end of the finger and pull the ends diagonally around below. Then I use nail scissors to snip off, in a curve around the shape of the finger, any sharp corners and any flaps sticking out. (If there are gaps then in the gauzy part, you can put another band-aid on horizontally over it, or a bit of bandage-tape.) Plastic band-aids are the worst for the sharpness, but cloth ones are the worst for obtrusive flaps. So I buy band-aids that have the sticky part made out of stretchy foam, or best of all for fingertips, Nexcare Soft 'n' Flex, since it's the thinnest stretchy kind. The combination of the technique with one of these types is much more comfortable than, and at least as secure as, any specialized fingertip-band-aid. So if you can buy new band-aids of a general sort any time, try Nexcare Soft 'n' Flex ones, or foam (a.k.a. 'sport') ones of whatever brand you like.
How can I neutralize the odor of Tide washing detergent?
Wash the items again, with your normal soap, plus half a cup of baking soda. It would help to use the soaking cycle on the washing machine too, and lemon juice and vinegar can't hurt. If it's not enough, run another cycle with baking soda. I use baking soda on teenagers' sweaty socks and undershirts and jiu-jitsu uniforms, and they come out smelling perfectly. I believe in this power of baking soda so much that when I once bought a used book several hundred pages long smelling just as you describe, I spent a couple of hours spreading baking soda over every surface of every page, since of course you can't wash a book, then left it for a few days, then brushed off every surface of every page. It didn't turn out perfectly, since it wasn't washed, but close, and I can now use the book without any distraction of smell. By the way, washing soda is not as effective at removing smells in the laundry.
Measuring my altitude above sea level accurately
Flip the building horizontalI'm presuming the ground height of your building, 700 feet, is good enough for your purposes, so it's really a question of finding the height of your building. If not use a local typographic map with height indications.From a viewpoint where you see both the base and your floor of the building, use some measure to rotate the height of the building into a horizontal distance. I.e find something which at an arms length equals the height of the building, and then rotate this length to the horizontal level and measures it afterwards. This does require free sight to a point horizontal to the left or right of the base of the building...Edit: Here are some illustrations of the concept.Stand sideways at point where you see the entire building. At an arms length hold a stick and make the top align with the top of the building, and put your thumb at the point aligning with the bottom of the building. Now rotate your arm 90 degrees.Now align the thumb to the corner of the building, and mark out where the top of the stick is pointing. Go over to the building, and measure from this poing back to the corner of the building, and you have the correct height of the building. Essentially you flipped the building from vertical to horizontal, and are now able to measure it more easily.Major edit: Hopefully this is not so vague, and illustrates my point of flipping the building over much better. Images made by myself
Cleaning hydrochloric acid stains from metal
Since it's actually etched into the metal, you'll need to buff the sink to a consistent finish. One method, assuming it's a stainless steel surface, is to use a mild abrasive with oxalic acid, such as Barkeepers Friend and clean and abrade the entire sink with a sponge or cloth. This will require a lot of rubbing. If that does not produce a consistent finish, abrasive grits can be used, starting with a moderately coarse (low number grit) and finishing with one that gives an even matte appearance.Do not use steel wool, which inevitably leaves embedded fragments that rust.
Measuring my altitude above sea level accurately
The angular approachEither from the flat or from the outside find a point at the same height as the base of the building, and use some device to calculate the viewing angle to the point. Measure the distance at base level to your point and use standard calculus to find the height (I.e use Pythagoras therom)If you have 45 degrees, then the distance from the building is the same as the height. Add this to the known height of base level of building. This method requires the most calculations, but could be the most precise given that you are able to get a good reading of the angles.See also measuring the height of trees from StackExchange, or tree facts from OneOak regarding the formulas.The formula to use is:Height of building = ( tan a * AB) + (tan b * AB)To get the angles, either use a hypsometer, like the one in the OneOak link, or try something like the following:Hold a piece of board to a wall and get the proper sight of the top (or bottom) of the building along the edge of the boardPut your smart phone on top of the boardUse a bubble level app to read out the angle of the boardMajor edit: Keeping the concept, but adding illustrations and references to another question on StackExchange, which refers to the same methods as I've presented here (amongst others)
Measuring my altitude above sea level accurately
Measure level heightFrom your window use your laser measuring device and measure the distance up or down one story, and multiply by your level. Measure from bottom to bottom of the window, of from top to top.The key point is to measure two known distances (A and B) with your measuring device, subtract these from each other, and then you get the exact height of each level. Multiply and add this to the known height of base level of building. In this way you don't need access to the other levels, except for visual references. But you are still able to get a fairly accurate height between levels/floors.Edit: Edited as someone downvoted solution, without grasping the context, which is doable and usable.
Keep pen from falling out of pocket (or attach it to body in convenient way)
Try using a carabiner retractable keychain pen, or maybe using your phones text (or note) capabilities (thusly avoiding the need of a pen).If those fails (or doesn't suit you), use the pen clip to attach the pen to the inside of your shirt. Either in the collar, or if a buttoned shirt horizontal somewhere above the waist line. That shouldn't go against uniform policies and be less visually intrusive than anything hanging from the waist.Yet another option would be to have a carabiner pen (of some sort) and attach it to the car key when driving, and your belt loop when walking.
A trick to make bulk erasable handwritten notes on traditional paper and in books?
Some cool answers have been given using heat erasable pens, but what about simply make the notes outside of the book, and use a referencing system to link the notes? Then you can make and keep (or delete) notes without cluttering up your books at all!
How do I prop up a laptop screen with a broken hinge?
you could make a hinge much like you find on a photo frame although this would have to be attached to the lid of the laptop and would look unsightly.if that wouldn't be a problem then all you would need is a stiff piece of card cut into a triangle, and something to attach it eg. duct tape  if attached with a couple of millimetres between the lid and card it would fold to the side quite nicely

What is a permanent solution for black mold?
You have not said where this mould is or what the conditions are. So here is just a helpful guess.Firstly, the mould spores are always there, you can't get rid of them forever, so you have to stop them from flourishing. Most of all you have to get it dry. Ventilate! Move your furniture and stuff an inch (25 mm) away from the wall. Dry the spot by using heat. Of course this may spread the spores around the place, wash them off first. Make sure your problem areas are always well ventilated. If this is a bedroom then get used to sleeping with an open window.-Using a dehumidifier is a good short-term solution, but uses a lot of electricity. -Never ventilate on a warm day when outside is warmer than in. Otherwise warm, moisture-laden air comes in and the water condenses on your cool areas.That's the first step. Now we have to stop moisture from collecting in corners and similar spots. It does this where one spot is colder than the others. If the house belongs to you then insulate it on the outside. Otherwise talk to your landlord about it. Often cold spots are above window frames because the house structure has design faults. You might like to insulate on the inside, though that's not the optimal solution.So your answer is to ventilate and insulate.edit: a new point I thought of. You can paint the problem area with fungus-preventing paint. I got some of this for the north side of my garage and it works very well. However, this is probably not suitable for indoors - but you could ask in the paint shop.
How do I prop up a laptop screen with a broken hinge?
Get a piece of styrofoam packing (which I suppose counts as ordinary household stuff, no?) Carve it into an angled shape with a recess that holds the screen in a press fit.
How can I safely sanitise my smartphone's display?
Here is a life hack that may be just what you need but, if not, will be useful for more other applications than you'd ever have imagined. There is a low cost and very effective sanitiser available. I do not know if it will damage your screen coating, but I'd expect that it wouldn't. The material, which I'll call Baq for short, is used in the majority of disinfectants and sanitisers. Also sold as carpet shampoo, floor wash, hand sanitiser, mouthwash, mould preventer, moss remover, pool sanitiser and more. Despite its apparently fearsome abilities it is also used at low concentrations, as an oral disinfectant. It is variously known as eg Quaternary ammonium salts / Lauryl dimethyl benzyl alkonium chloride, Benzyl alkonium chloride and more. Once you've seen it mentioned a few times you'll find it under a range of similar names in many (possibly most) cleaning and sanitising products. Read the ingredient labels on as many disinfectants as you can find. Here most use Baq. The cost per active ingredient varies widely. Baq is available at a range of concentrations and prices that usually utterly fail to reflect how cheap it really is. Here (in New Zealand) I can buy 2 litres (about half a gallon) of 2% concentrated baq for $2. That can be diluted 20  to 1 (20 parts of water to 1 part of Baq) to make (close enough to) 0.1% Baq solution. This cam be used as a hand sanitiser, kitchen bench wipe down, disc-cloth soaker, shower cleaner , general disinfectant - and cellphone screen cleaner. I would be surprised if it caused screen damage but, as they say, try it in an unimportant area first.How good is it? - At about 0.1% to 0.25% concentration it is sold here in Chemist shops as an approved hand sanitiser which is superior overall to 65%+ alcohol hand sanitiser. This costs over $10 for 250 ml x say 0.25%, so is about$10/$2 x 2l/250ml x 2%/0.25% = 10 x 8 x 8 = 600+ times dearer per active ingredient that the disinfectant I buy in the local supermarket. And no more effective. As a general purpose value or money life-hack it's about as good as they come.For smart phone sanitising it may be as well. 
What is a permanent solution for black mold?
Depending on the environment this is happening in (pets, children, food preparation, ...) this permanent solution might not apply. A bit of back-ground: Mould is one of the oldest life forms on Earth and thus pretty resistant to pretty much everything...  You can temporarily stop growth, but even bleach, ammonia, ... are no permanent solutions.The solution:Before attempting any of the following remedies, you need rubber boots, chemical gloves and a gas-mask.Therefore, use the following: (higher number = more effective = more toxic)Peroxide: The Marilyn Monroe of the solutions, but not the normal pharmacy 2%, but the nasty 30 or 40% industrial-strength product.  It works by releasing ionic oxygen, so the gas-mask might seem superfluous but is really needed as it'll burn your lungs. 30-40% Peroxide also stings like hell if even a tiny drop gets on your skin and feels like someone is poking you with a needle for an hour or so (though no permanent damage will be done, happened quite a few times to myself).Use a natural sponge (no synthetics!) to scrub off the mould and soak all the tiny cracks the mould is growing out of...  You'll notice a slight fizzying as you apply this: this is absolutely normal as the ionic oxygen is being released.  Don't just clean the area with the mould itself, but clean as much around it as well as the spores will be everywhere.  If possible, clean the walls, floor and ceiling as well in the room/corridor/basement this is happening in.  (Don't use a vacuum cleaner: it'll make things worse)Sulphuric acid: The vitriolic of the solutions, just not the normal battery acid (5%), but real vitriol that is hygroscopic and will not only liquefy any deep spores, but pull out microscopic amounts of water from the cracks that contain the mycelia.  No need to describe what vitriol does to your skin: a mummy will look fresh compared to a skin that gets even a tiny drop on it!Use a high-quality synthetic sponge and please don't apply this on wood, calcium-containing stone (bluestone, sandstone, calcite), metal or similar materials (bricks, cement, concrete are no problem). You'll notice a bit of heat as you apply the vitriol; this is due to the hygroscopic effect and is absolutely normal.  Again: don't just clean the moulded area, but as much around it as well to kill off the spores as with solution #1.Potassium Cyanide: This is the kill-all of cleaning products!  Containing a triple Carbon-Nitrogen bond it breaks open any mould DNA down to the molecular level and leaves behind the most sterile and clean area you've ever witnessed.  Just add it to water (even a 2% solution will work great!) and again use a sponge (synthetic or natural: now it doesn't matter) and the same physical treatment as the above solutions.  This is the most permanent solution of all!Whichever of the solutions you took, it's important to let the entire room dry (adding an air conditioner set to dehumidification mode is an asset) as mould needs water (even in microscopic quantities) to flourish!Final warning: If you would want to apply all of the above, please allow sufficient time between applications as mixing the vitriol with the Potassium Cyanide will generate Hydrogen Cyanide: a gas smelling of nice raw almonds that kills any oxygen-breathing life-form on Earth within seconds!And finally: apply another coat of water-resistant paint to the surfaces thus treated!
Measuring my altitude above sea level accurately
The first two ideas require knowing the altitude of your building.You may have a building manager / contractor that actually knows how tall each story in the building is.Tie a rock to the end of a string, hang it out your window, and measure how long it is when it touches the ground ( think "kite string" )Other than that I think you will need rather precise tools to get a better estimate than just guessing at the height of each floor.Water boils at different temperatures at different altitudes, but we're talking about a few degrees at most.  So, you're going to be needing to be able to measure within thousands of a degree to get within 10 feet.It is simple to make a clinometer, fir which you can measure the angle to an object of known distance.  I believe tan ( angle ) / distance will give you the height difference ( trigonometry ).  Again though, the further away the object, the more precise you will need to be.  If you knew the altitude of your building,  you could even measure the angle to across the street. 
How do I prop up a laptop screen with a broken hinge?
I like large binder clips for problems like this.  Clip the black part to the edge of the lid, and adjust the silver "ears" so that they prop up the screen.  If the ears aren't long enough, use something like a thick book behind the laptop for the ears to lean on.

It helps hold the shirts together and keep your drawers neat. Just add one extra fold and place your shirts like files in your dresser drawer.
What is a permanent solution for black mold?
Black mold is caused by Stachybotrys (also known as "toxic black mold" in the US( and it's usually associated with poor indoor air quality that arises after fungal growth on water-damaged building materials and exposure can cause adverse health effects.The worst-case scenario for homeowners is produced by consecutive episodes of water damage that promote fungal growth and mycotoxin synthesis, followed by drier conditions that facilitate the liberation of spores and hyphal fragments2003.Remember that simply killing the mold with a biocide is not enough. It can grow on any substance (on wood, paper, carpet, and foods) and there is no practical way to eliminate all mold and mold spores in the indoor environment. The way to control indoor mold growth is to control moisture.The first step is solving an indoor mold problem which is always stopping the source of moistureEPA:Assess the area infected with mold, checking for any hidden mold.Identify and permanently fix the source of the leaks or seepage (such as water problem) to prevent mold growth. Water leaks in pipes, around tubs and sinks and can provide a place for biological pollutants to grow.Secondly get rid of mold it-self:Clean and dry any damp or wet building materials and furnishings.Clean mold off hard surfaces with water and detergent, and dry completely.Clean all components of the HVAC system to ensure nothing becomes contaminated.Remove any object/materials near the insulation system that may have been contaminated.Use mold removal compositions (such as containing anionic surfactants and sodium hydroxide)US5783550After removing mold, here are the things which can prevent mold keeps growing back:Reduce indoor humidity (to 30-60%) to decrease mold growth. Use dehumidifiers and air conditioners (be sure that the appliances themselves don't become sources of biological pollutants).Reduce the potential for condensation on cold surfaces on cold surfaces.Be sure crawlspaces are well-ventilated.Turn off certain appliances (such as humidifiers, kerosene heaters) if you notice moisture on windows and other surfaces. Or remove/dispose contaminated HVAC filter media.Vent your clothes dryer to the outside.Raise the temperature of cold surfaces where moisture condenses.Increase air circulation.Use exhaust fans (e.g. in bathrooms and kitchens) to remove moisture to the outside.Move furniture from wall corners to promote air and heat circulation.Keep open doors between rooms (especially to closets which are colder than other rooms) to increase circulation.In areas where there is a perpetual moisture problem, do not install carpeting. It can absorb moisture and serve as a place for biological pollutants to grow. If you have insulated air ducts and the insulation gets wet or moldy, it should be removed and replaced.Consider replacing the insulation in the HVAC system with an external to prevent future floodwater contamination.If above conditions causing the mold growth are not corrected, mold growth could recur.In case where the area of mold is large you should hire a remediation manager to properly dispose of the mold or consult with a qualified professional.See also:Mold growth, assessment, and remediation at WikipediaHow to reduce the air humidity in a room? at LH
Measuring my altitude above sea level accurately
Some of the more modern smartphones (especially flagships) have a barometer integrated to assist with the GPS altitude measurements.So technically you could use your phone's GPS to determine the altitude (bear in mind to stay close to the window, possibly even open the window for a better GPS signal).An option is also, that you put a marker of some sort on your window, that measures exactly 1 foot, then take a photo of your building, where you can see your window and the base of the building simultaneously, without using special (fish-eye) lenses, then you can use pixels as a measurement of approximately how high you are living.

I hang all my t-shirts on hangers in a closet. They are never wrinkled (provided I pull them out of the dryer soon after it turns off).
Keep pen from falling out of pocket (or attach it to body in convenient way)
You could attache the pen via tape or through a hole in the key to a retractable ski pass holder (don't know the english word, in german it's a Skipasshalter). These have a sting attached to them which will go back into the body after it was retracted. These are most of the time cheap giveaways but there are also metallic "better looking" ones. If you attach one of those inside your jacket or perhaps your sleeve (as @Carl suggested in his answer) it is our of sight. 
How to remove lint from a shirt without a lint brush?
Using rubber gloves might do the trick, just caress the shirt with the gloves and the static electricity should remove lint and pet hair.Just make sure the gloves are new and dry.
Stick to a morning routine
In general, rather than trying to figure out some new-fangled way to keep track of all the things you do in the morning, my suggestion is to reduce the amount of things you need to do in the morning by doing them the night before.  Things like packing your lunch, putting out clothes, having your bag/briefcase ready,  etc. can all be done the night before and will save you time, energy, and potential forgetfulness the next morning.  If there is something that needs to be done in the morning, write a note with big, black marker on a piece of paper and put it in/under something that you will definitely need to use/grab (wallet, car keys, phone).  The final part of my suggestion is to eliminate all of the "dilly-dally" and "nootsing" that you may do in the morning.  Your sole goal for the morning should be getting out the door.  Don't decide to start reading a magazine article, don't fold laundry, don't turn on the TV, don't listen to music.  Wake up, do what has to be done in the morning (brush teeth, get dressed, eat, etc) and leave for the day.
Keep a rug lying flat on a carpet
You may be able to get some heavy-duty red thread and sew the edges of the rug to your carpet. (I'm not sure; I haven't tried it.) Removing the rug would be as simple as cutting a few of the heavy-duty threads.
How to wake up without waking up other people in the same room
To fill some of the gaps of the already proposed headphones solution, I would suggest SleepPhones. They're a comfortable headband with headphone speakers built in for the purpose of use while sleeping.I use them to listen to music while falling asleep and find that, a lot of the time, I wake the next day still wearing them, and the sound from the headphones doesn't disturb my sleep-mate. This seems like it would be a convenient way to keep an alarm exclusive.They come in wired (single cloth wrapped cable) or Bluetooth wireless version. The Bluetooth is listed as having an 18-20 hour battery life which should be enough to still be active for alarm time in the morning.Source: I use them (the wired ones; gray if you're curious; I bought them on Amazon)Note: No, I don't sell them, nor do I get any commission. They just work well for me so I thought I'd share.
How to wake up without waking up other people in the same room
this will sound ridiculous, but bear with me.When I have a specific time that I HAVE to wake up at (say for a flight or train), before I go to bed I will repeat to myself "I need to wake up at 6:30" about ten or fifteen times and it may not wake me up right at that time, but I will generally wake up within about +/- 15 minutes of the intended time. I learned to do this in high school when I did not have an alarm clock.  After doing it for a few months, I was able to wake up at 7:12 every morning without an alarm.  Downvote/flag this if you want and I'll delete it because I realize how ridiculous it sounds but it can't hurt to try, and it definitely helps me every day.
How to wake up without waking up other people in the same room
There are light alarm clocks, which you could use selectively.  Essentially a light slowly turns on rather than making noise.  Selective placement of the light-alarm or standard sleep blindfold mask would prevent your significant other from being awakened.In essence combine the following two:+Another option I thought of was to use your cell phone alarm on vibrate mode and put it under your pillow; you might need to put it in the pillow case (underside of pillow) so it doesn't get lost.  Sleep well...
Keep a rug lying flat on a carpet
You could pin the rug through the carpet into the floor. Use nails with wide heads, or a heavy duty staple gun. A couple on each end of the rug should hold it steady. Another option, as stated in another answer would be to see the rug to the carpet. You can also get a rubber mat to hold it still, although designed for hard floor I think it would be effective, but not as much as the previous options and also more costly than the previous suggestions.
How to wake up without waking up other people in the same room
I just keep my phone on the bed by my pillow. If you're a light sleeper you can probably turn off the phone before the sound gets really obnoxious. 
Gave my mobile number out online. Now I'm being spammed?
You can opt-out but it seems that it doesn't help. The companies calling you are most likely different ones each time. If it is the normal survey sites they sell your details on.I would suggest downloading a blacklisting app or get a new number.
How can I save space in my closet?
Soda can tabs can be used to accomplish various tasks. That is one of them.Also this problem can be solved using soda can tabs. Thread a hanger through one hole of the soda can tab. Use the second hole in the soda can tab to hang another hanger. By now you realize that Red Bull can tabs don't work well because they have their bull-logo instead of a second hole.Depending on the stability of your initial hanger you can repeat this as many times as you wantAnother method not dependent on the stability of the soda can tabs or the initial hanger uses a chain instead.
How can I hide a cable from a lamp in my room
Use surface wiring.Run the wire through the ceiling and/or wall; it's not difficult, in most cases, but should be inspected by an electrician if you do it yourself.Conceal it with something such as fake beams.
How can I remove the plastic seal inside new coffee jar in its whole?
Just switch containers after opening the one the coffee came in.  Use a clean, opaque, airtight container to store the coffee instead of the one that they provide you.  Also from what I can see, the container they give you is clear which is not ideal for coffee storage.
How do I stop cars from tailgating?
For someone aggressively tailgating, they generally want to pass, so you can slow down and pull to the side, or change lanes if possible, so they can pass you. You don't want to have them around you so letting them pass is your best option. Unless you did something to anger them, like cutting them off. In which case you will either have to deal with it for a short while or call the police because they will likely just tailgate you till they are satisfied. Whatever you do, do not stop or engage them, people die this way. The problem with the other type is generally they aren't paying attention so there isn't much you can do besides my first suggestion since they won't notice anything you do because they aren't paying attention. 
How do I stop cars from tailgating?
You could put some sort of sign on the back of your car like a piece of poster board in the window (maybe a small piece of plywood and some screws? Although that could damage your car.) that says something about not going any faster so they can just go around. 
How do I stop cars from tailgating?
I generally do the following::Ease off on the acceleratorThis slows us both down and reduces the potential impact of a later collisionIt also makes it easier for them to overtake and more likely that they'll do soTap the brakes gently occasionally in the hope that the lights cause them to slow downSlowing down in either of these ways obviously creates some risk that they'll immediately hit me, but the relative speed would be low so it's better than a serious rear-ending later if I have to stop suddenly.
Make coffee with no coffee filters?
I have in the past used a Muslin cloth with a paper cup.First cut the bottom off the cup, then line the inside of the cup with muslin and away you go. Not by any means a perfect solution but ok in a fix
How do I stop cars from tailgating?
Many are suggesting to use the brakes which seems a very risky proposition.Someone used the following technique on me when I was inadvertently tailgating a corvette that was driving irresponsibly (he was gunning it when the light changed to hurry up to that next red light.) I assumed he would speed off at any moment so was following a little too close for his comfort.  He put on his hazard lights for a few flashes. That immediately got my attention and did not use the brake at all. This is less abrasive than the windshield wiper method but probably can't be seen as a coincidence but is less likely to further anger someone I would think.However, none of these answers will likely work for the aggressive tailgater out to get you, so you should probably (try to) let them pass.
How do I stop cars from tailgating?
Examine your environment. What's the speed limit? Are you going too slow, or is the tailgater going too fast? Is there a way they could pass you, or you could move out of the way? Give them an opening, if you can. A lot of times, these problems can be solved by focusing on the world around you, instead of just focusing on the angry person behind you. Of course, if you're dealing with a person who's tailgating you just to be a jerk, then there is little you can do to resolve the problem. Just slow down (gently) to avoid serious damage. 
How do I stop cars from tailgating?
My experience in my area is some percentage of tailgaters will correct themselves after you flash the brakes, some percentage will correct themselves if you slow down by 5 or 10 MPH, and some percentage will correct themselves after you do both, and this adds up to almost all tailgaters, although some are more stubborn than others.I usually flash my brakes first, as it also counts as a warning that I'm going to start slowing down. (flashing the brakes is also useful to make sure you're noticed by someone who is a ways behind you and travelling a fair bit faster than you)"Correct themselves" usually means that they will finally think about passing you, although occasionally it means they will back off a bit (and some will even maintain a reasonable distance for a while after you speed back up).I am the only person on the road who travels the speed limit, though; if you tend to speed, you'll probably get different results than I do. (also, different areas probably have different driving habits)I will also advise giving yourself a lot of extra room between yourself and the car ahead of you, so as to reduce the likelihood you'll have to slow down rapidly and consequently exacerbate the danger of being tailgated.
How do I stop cars from tailgating?
A technique I've found useful on occasion is to briefly turn on the headlights. This causes the brake lights to illuminate as if you're braking, but without reducing your speed at all.The illuminated brake lights are generally enough to get the tailgater to back off (as they think you're slowing down), but since you don't actually lose any speed there's no risk of closing the gap and causing a tail-end collision.This is a similar approach as the left-foot braking advocated in Lefty's answer, but much easier to accomplish safely (especially if you're not practiced at left-foot braking).There are, however, a few downsides to the technique:Some vehicles have automated headlights, which makes the technique difficult or impossible to apply (@holroy).The flashing headlights may confuse traffic ahead of the vehicle, as they think you're trying to communicate to them. (@David Richerby)It's not going to work at night, since (hopefully) your headlights are already turned on.As a result, this won't be useful under all circumstances. However, it should still be useful to some drivers, under some circumstances.
How do I stop cars from tailgating?
I had a friend tell me his "trick" today for deterring tailgating and I actually gave it a shot on my commute home.Basically, if a car is following you too closely, you can pretend to adjust your rear view mirror repeatedly. I just lifted my arm up and slowly wiggled the thing while driving, with my eyes forward the whole time.The car that was tailgating me let off the accelerator for a couple minutes before resuming with the tailgating. I did it again, and sure it enough he let up some space again!  Not sure why, maybe the person behind gets "spooked" that the person in front is watching them  (meanwhile they can't actually see the driver)?
Keep the tea bag underwater while microwaving
I have had this problem as well. My solution: pour hot water in the glass add the tea bag add some sugar and mix it along with the tea bag in the cup, it won't rise then :)
How do I get the bin bag (trash bag) outside without it dripping all over me?
Instead of walking about with a bin bag, take the indoor bin with you when you need to empty it.Then, once outside, transfer the bag from the indoor to the outdoor bin in one smooth steady motion.By limiting the amount of time the bin bag is jostling about, you should reduce the amount of sloshing of the liquid within it.Another advantage is that you're now outside to tip away any bin juice that may be in the bottom of the bin too.
Ηow can I keep my jeans' zippers from unzipping on their own?
You could avoid the need to constantly rezip jeans by sidestepping the problem entirely.I only wear button/rivet fly jeans for this exact reason.All major manufacturers of jeans provide designs without zips, if you find unzipping is a constant worry, they're a very simple solution.
How to open a beverage can that has a broken tab?
Lay a teaspoon on the hole, face-down, keeping the tip of the head against the edge of the tab/hole.Apply pressure to the middle of the head of the spoon.This will push the tab into the hole, in much the same fashion as the actual ring pull would.Take care to only press on the middle of the head of the spoon - stay away from the edges, otherwise your finger may slip into the hole when the tab gives way (which nobody wants).
What office equipment can I use to safely observe a solar eclipse?
Remember the floppy discs? We dug one out from our storage, opened it up and looked through the film sheet. Alternatively, a friend of mine took a lighter and a glass cup mat. He placed the glass mat above the lighter to get some soot onto it and watched it through the mat.
How do I soften my beard without going to a beauty parlour?
I use jojoba oil on mine. The fancy beard oils are usually a jojoba oil base with nice scents added for effect. After I wash the beard I pat it dry, brush out the remaining droplets, oil it liberally with my fingers, then comb it.
How do I trim my facial hair symmetrically and the same every time
The beard neck line can be difficult to keep symmetrical.  One technique I use is to get a piece of string a couple of feet long, place it above my Adam's apple, loop it over my ears and pull tight.Voila! The string follows the contour of your jawline, giving you a very clear line to follow with the shaver.
How can I quickly eliminate the smell of cigarette smoke in a confined space?
I have had great success using Febreeze to get rid of the smell of cigarette smoke. Especially in things like a couch or carpet. Works good for the car as well.  Also, after I quit smoking I never let my smoking friend smoke in my car or home. They respected that and I never had to worry about it. Maybe you can ask you friends to not smoke in your place or car? It's not really fair of them to stink up your space if you think about it. 
Keep the tea bag underwater while microwaving
I use a silicone spoon. Silicone has great heat-resistant qualities so it can withstand being in the microwave without melting and it keeps the teabag submerged just like you asked! Another plus is that they are pretty cheap to buy online. 
How do I separate multiple 5-gallon buckets efficiently?
I've done the air pressure into the sides of the bucket and it has worked - started with a needle valve for inflating sports ball, which loosened it just enough to stick a little bit larger tapered valve for inflating vinyl rafts.On the prescriptive side to avoid getting them stuck, I wrap the buckets with two layers of 2" wide duct tape just below the bottom anti-distortion ring and embed three equally spaced pieces of rigid wire between the duct tape wraps.  I like to use #12 insulated electrical wire and I cut them at about 1-3/4" so they don't extend beyond the tape.  Takes just 1-2 minutes per bucket to do, but keeps the them from fully nesting and maintains an air gap to avoid the vacuum seal.  You can push them in slightly to nest them for carrying.  You gain about 1" height per bucket when nested.  
How do I stop cars from tailgating?
You don't want to brake when you're being tailgated — but you do want to activate your brakelights.  That's why a friend installed a mechanism to activate brake lights without actually braking.  He said that he wasn't sure if it was quite legal — but that it certainly was effective.Of course, if someone is actively assaulting you, the correct response is to phone emergency services (112, 911, etc., depending on location).
How does one efficiently clean-up hair from sink after shaving or trimming beard?
I have a piece of poster board that I cover my sink with.  I have folded the board to rest easy on the faucet, as well as stop any hair from sliding off the paper.The hair is still dry, so it slides right into the trash when I'm done ( or I put it outside for birdies to make nests out of ).There are always a few hairs that manage to get on the sink, but I wash them down, as I feel it is less hair than one who shaves everyday would wash down.I've been using the same piece of poster board for about ten years now.
If I break a water pipe, is there a way to stop the flow while I go turn off the water?
You can't stop the flow. Every second you spend fiddling with the pipe is a second the main valve is still open.Ok, I kinda exaggerated, but in situations like that it's either obvious what you can do (eg divert the flow to the nearby bathtub) or there is no other way than running for the valve.
What is an effective way to clean stainless steel appliances without commercial products?
Oxalic acid, or cleaners with oxalic acid, such as Barkeepers Friend, are effective at removing stains from stainless steel. If the surface is lacquered brushed steel or brushed aluminum, though, they could damage the finish.The cleaners themselves, though, may leave a bit of powdery abrasive residue that has to be removed.
How do I minimize dirt tracked around the house?
You said people entering your house remove their footwear, but still carry dirt on their socks - you may try giving them a pair of shoes to use in-house only. This way even if they have dirt on socks, it will remain captured inside the shoe. Once the person stops using them, you can wash them in the washing machine. Look for shoes made of cloth or some other washable material (I've seen this kind is often used around Europe - also have them at home and you can easily wash them and they are really cheap to buy).Take note, some people consider that the practice of giving your guests shoes is rude.
What is an effective way to clean stainless steel appliances without commercial products?
We find the white melamine sponges (sold as Magic Eraser, but there are generic types widely available) can work really well, but they warn against using it on the front of stainless-steel appliances without trying it in an inconspicuous area first. Wipe in the direction of the brush finish, not in swirly motions. 
How do I minimize dirt tracked around the house?
At that time of year, focus on the cleaning the "front hall" or "mudroom" - the place where people come in and remove their shoes - much more often than the rest of the house. Dirt from the shoes of one person can easily get onto the sock (or bare foot) of that same person, or someone else who comes through the hall later. This is especially likely if people go in and out of that hall area all the time, not just on their way in and out of the home. A few moments spent sweeping or vacuuming the front hall every day during the muddy (or dusty, or grass-clippingsy) season may enable you to vacuum the entire rest of the house far less often. Consider keeping the broom or vacuum in that area so it's easy for anyone to do a quick cleanup. Also consider ways to reduce the requirement for people to go in and out of that area - for example we keep the reusable produce bags in the front hall closet, and when we use the last of a vegetable we put the bag away there, meaning we have to go through the potentially dirty area to do so. If you have a similar setup, see if you can move something that is stored in the dirty area to a cleaner area, at least during the dirty season.As well, set things up so that people do not have to come in far to get their shoes on or off. Without a bench by the front door, people may walk to the stairs to sit and take their shoes off. This creates a larger dirty area. Also, provide a "boot tray" for people to put their dirty shoes on. Whatever dirt falls off the shoes may be confined there and in any event, people are less likely to walk across a boot tray than across empty floor. An area rug by the door can keep the dirt localized. I even know people who have sort of straw mat things that the dirt is supposed to fall through. This involves lifting them up and sweeping under them which frankly seems like too much work to me, but I include it for completeness.
If I break a water pipe, is there a way to stop the flow while I go turn off the water?
Rather than fix the problem why not prevent it? Close the main valve while working on such a critical pipe. You wouldn't want to get the water to come into contact with electrical sockets and the like, would you?Nobody in your house should miss the water for those 15 minutes you're working on the pipes. If it's extensive maintenance then you and your family can easily survive a few hours with just a few buckets and/or jerry cans of water and a bit of planning.
If I break a water pipe, is there a way to stop the flow while I go turn off the water?
You say "pump" so I'm going to assume you've got a well with a submersible pump (or one of the old above ground pumps, but they're rare these days), rather than city water. If you have city water, find the main shutoff valve (usually near the water meter in the basement, I think). Find the circuit breaker on your power panel that controls the pump and turn it off before working on the water. Ideally, there will be markings on each of the breakers describing (cryptically) what they control. After you're finished, have a helper turn it on and stay by the switch while you inspect for leaks. If, for some reason, you really don't want to turn it off while you're working on it, at least locate it so you can run and turn it off before it causes expensive flood damage. If you have city water, find the main shutoff valve (usually near the water meter in the basement, I think), and turn it off and on as with the circuit breaker. 
How do I stop cars from tailgating?
How do I stop cars from tailgating?I have a method which works well and/but which I use only in circumstances where it seems likely to reduce and not increase the all round risk. I've used it more on large trucks than cars.Why do it: If it makes good sense to let the tailgater go I would generally do so.This may not be the case in some traffic situations where the tailgater is dangerously close if a stop is required and allowing overtaking is not a good immediate option. Reasons for this can arise for a range of reasosns but two typical situations are if allowing overtaking may increase the danger as they overtake (some mix of: tight winding road, low visibility, wet, no overtaking lines, ...) create a situation where my overall 'quality of travel' would be severely degraded with no or vastly less gain (eg stock transporter streaming effluent in a high traffic country road situation - if he overtakes me he is then trapped in front of me and I get splattered with cattle excrement for many miles - dangerous as well as unpleasant.Warning: Bear in mind in the following situations that a large laden truck may weigh 40 tons and probably mote than 20, and has a stopping distance better than ocean liners and freight trains but much much much worse than for cars. The action should be taken to try to reduce the chance of deathy not to increase it.Method: Ease very gently back on throttle to close gap between you and tailgater and, "until you are certain that you have their attention". ie there WILL come a point where they must be aware that the gap is closing towards zero. You are hardly if at all in any more danger at this point as an accident was almost certain in the prior case in the event of a sudden stop.Then continue to slowly lower your roadspeed and open the gap between you and the vehicle ahead of you. The vehicle behind you has no realistic option but to maintain minimum gp and lower speed. An utter idiot / drunk / man on a mission may make vehicle to vehicle contact, but this is extremely unlikely, and you might as well find out about him now with some degree of control, than later by mistake.  When an "adequate" gap has opened up in front of you accelerate "very crisply" and then brake very visibly (good long burst of brakelights) to arrive at and maintain a safe following distance behind the car in front of you.The tailgater is now well clear of you, you are at safe speed and distance from the car in front and the tail gater is travelling below queue speed. They can choose to adapt, to now maintain a safe distance, or may "as sometimes happens" accelerate aggressively and get back 'on your tail'. You can repeat the procedure above multiple times and they cannot prevent you doing so BUT odds are that 2 or 3 times max is the most that is useful. It it has not worked after a few applications a modified version will work, one way or another.Plan BDrop back as before and stay back. If possible and useful make it possible for them to overtake safely. If they do not overtake and do not increase the following gap you can maintain a following distance that is enough for both of you in an emergency.Occasions where I would try not to allow them to overtake might be the "stock truck" situation where they cannot go anywhere once they have passed and will then be splattering excrement all over your car indefinitely. In such cases you can generally control the speed and location of the following vehicle. If they are so aggressive as to continue to threaten your life repeatedly then a record of their number plate and a subsequent telephone call may help prevent others being similarly threatened.  Large heavily laden trucks generally cannot realistically overtake in such situations if not 'allowed to'.Again - the aim is to improve safety and reduce risk overall. If you can realistically let them go then doing so will often be the best choice.
How do I separate 2 drinking glasses that are stuck?
Try holding a vibrating object such as an electric shaver (or perhaps even toothbrush) to the outer glass while pulling gently.
How can I "wear in" my shoes without wearing them?
There are these things: I have no clue how they are called in english, but they are called "Schuhspreizer" in German (could translate into "shoe widener"). You put them into your shoes and they will widen them.
How to wake up without waking up other people in the same room
It might work setting a phone alarm to only vibrate and place in under the pillow, or maybe inside the backside of the pillow. IMPORTANT Please keep in mind that your phone creates an electromagnetic field so having it close to your head while sleeping might be unhealthy.
How can I clean my sticky keyboard?
In my experience, magic erasers work wonders for this sort of stuff.Slightly dampen a small part of a magic eraserNot too much as keyboards are electronic as you stated and water + electronics = bad day. Go across your keyboard, gently rubbing it, making sure you get everywhere you want toWipe off the keyboard with a paper towel to get any remaining moisture and grease off.
How do I ensure my car wheels are straight when parking before getting out?
Another cool way to know is adding a colored tape stripe to the top center part of the steering wheel like used in most race cars. It will give you the ability to know if your steering wheel is straight without looking down.As for knowing if the wheels are straight outside, the rule of thumb is, a steering wheel can do two full 360-degree turns before full lock. If you lock the wheel in one direction, just count two turns back to center and the wheels outside should be straight as well.
How can I affix pictures/photos to a wall cleanly without damaging the paint on the wall?
The Scotch mounting squares is a good suggestion but it's a high cost per photo. I use painting tape for delicate surfaces. Both Scotch and Frog make a version and they've both proven to be pretty reliable. I still have a single coat of builder's beige in my house and we've used the tape to hang things for a while so we can plan it all out. It's always removed easily with no damage. Even masking tape wasn't working that well.
How to trim your beard without a mirror?
I believe the question is not "how to shave without a mirror" but rather "how to shave without any reflecting surface or someone else helping you". If that's the case, you have to rely on sensory input other than visual.You've already said you use your palm to make sure the beard is even. I can't tell if that means you hold your hand against your neck and shave along the edge or if you shave and then touch it to check and touch-up until it's even. However, either idea should work.For me, I partially rely on muscle memory to get it as close as possible the first time. I will also close my eyes and focus on where the blade is on my face. For sideburns, I use an electric razor so I just attach a guide to get the length I want and, again, try to sense where the blade is to get both sides even.By definition, it's impossible to tell if it looks right without a way to visually confirm. You should be able to get pretty close by carefully shaving and checking by touch after the fact.
Hiding or covering annoying LED lights on computer and accessories
To dim LED lamps which are inside electrical devices such as a surface mount or discrete component on a motherboard, use PTFE (teflon) plumbing thread sealer. PTFE is an extremely good insulator and is resistant to fire and in the suggested tape form of extremely low density, cheap and very easy to obtain.PTFE is a great insulator and is opaque, it is very thin, for example in my region 0.075mm ( 0.00295276 inches) is the common thickness for water pipe.You can obtain different thickness/density variations of the tape, which will be more effective in completely blocking the light without applying may turns of the tape. Though being extremely thin, it is very easy to use a lot and it take little space up.  To use, simply try keep it flat and wrap it around the LED and keep some tension on the tape flat and stick it back to itself after a few turns.The advantage of using this is the lack of adhesive and electrical insulation properties. So you can use it to safely cover directly items attached to PCBs and over light channels without little worry it becomes displaced causing a short.See picture below for what it looks like and how it is used in its sealant role.
How to clean dead skin off feet?
If you have a high speed Dremel like tool, these with an abrasive attachment are very effective at physically grinding off the hard skin.  Of course you need to avoid pressing it too hard onto your skin as it will generate heat from the friction.You may apply something like KY jelly or moisturiser to your skin it will soften it and provide some protection against heat.  Otherwise a wet towel or a spray bottle can be used to douse any heat sensations instantly. On that front the heat is only very localized and dissipates very quickly and does not result in any burns.I know it sounds odd to use a 30,000 RPM tool to remove hard skin but myself and friends find it effective. Which tool to use is up to you really,obviously avoid anything like a cutting disk attachment, anything for grinding is most likely ok. Just be sure you aren't going to cut yourself with the tool head if you screw up, so sanding barrels are always safe on that front. Also finer grits aren't always better depending again on heat being generated. You wan't to get it over and done with quickly but you don't want to hurt yourself just learn what is an acceptable tool and method that avoids heat.  Example don't press down over a single location keep moving, and the heat generated will be spread around
How to trim your beard without a mirror?
Have a rigid shaving routine and use your fingers to feel for missed hairs. When trying to solve a task without visual aid, I often find it useful to investigate which routines blind people have come up with. I found this instructional video of a blind man showing how he shaves and I guess it's about as good as you can get with practice.
Keep the tea bag underwater while microwaving
You can use a metal spoon to keep it down. Contrary to popular belief, metal in a microwave isn't 100% a no go. It is just easier to present it that way to avoid confusion as few people know the workings of a microwave and the consequences thereof.While it generally is discouraged to leave metal objects in the microwave, the problem isn't the metal itself. Rather that metal will reflect microwaves and not absorb them to increase temperature. You already have metal walls in your oven for this reason. They help reflect the microwaves so eventually they will hit the food or liquid and me absorbed. If you have a mass of something containing water (i.e. pretty much anything organic) a little extra metal should not cause any problems. Especially if it is partially or fully submerged in the liquid.  I found another source of this by Google. I don't know the credentials of this site, so take it with a grain of salt. It does however look like he knows what he is talking about.Note: Please don't do this haphazardly and carelessly. Find another source than me saying this and read a little on why this works. A microwave oven is a powerful tool capable of concentrating about a kilowatt of energy in a small area. Treat it with respect.
How to keep change sorted in my pocket?
For a geeky look, try a coin holder, such as the Custom Accessories 91116 model I saw on Ace Hardware and Amazon sites, about US$4.The trouble with coins in pockets is that they can wind up in the wash or dryer, damaging the machines and tearing holes in the pocket (I've shorted out more than one dryer heating element).Alternatively, leave the coins as part of a tip.
How to keep change sorted in my pocket?
This is a problem for which I have found no good answers. Without buying extra products here is what you can do:Take small bags(plastic bags called Sandwich bags are quite good) and sort the coins by type into the bags. Now tie the bags tightly and put them into a coin purse. You can even put stickers on the bags indicating the amount in the bag.Store coins in the individual coin slots if you have such a wallet. Like below:And this:For the above style you may have to do the following:  You may have to wrap the wallet in a bag or cloth to stop the coins from falling out the top. This is only if you are very active and move a lot.You could make shapes or objects from them and store them that way.The link is here to Coinstruction. 
How can I clean my car headlights?
The easiest and most hacky way is using toothpaste. Yes, you've read right.

Clean blender as fast as possible, or prevent it from accumulating protein powder residue
The easiest way to clean a blender is to use the blender to clean itself. As you said a dishwasher cycle is pretty time consuming and not optimal if you use the blender several times a day. So turning the blender into a "dishwasher" is the solution.I couldn't think of anything, that would prevent powders from adhering to the blender. But here is the solution if they already are sticking there.What you'll need:some hot water (tap water is fine)dishwashing liquid(optional) half a lemon (white vinegar is an alternative)Steps to take:Fill the blender halfway with hot water.Add one or two drops of dishwashing liquid. If you have half a lemon this is the moment to add it. You can chop it coarsely.Turn on the blender and let it run on Low for about 30 seconds up to a minute (depending on the power and dirtiness of your blender).Pour out the soapy water.Rinse out the blender thoroughly with more hot water.Finished! Place upside down to air dry or use it right awayMore info (on why a lemon (or vinegar) helps) can be found below.Sources:wikiHowthe kitchnthe kitchnThe Blender GirlWonderHowTo
Cleaning around a fixed wire retainer
I don't know if it would fit, but you could get a bottle nipple cleaner from Wal-mart or Target or wherever you prefer.  It looks like a twisted wire with bristles coming off of it and is found in the baby section.  It is small enough to clean inside the nipples of a baby bottle so, if it is small enough, it might fit between the retainer and your teeth.
How to avoid answer papers being flappy under a fan?
We can control the flying(flapping)   papers by inserting a pen cap like a paperclip on a couple of papers together. This will probably makes papers difficult to flap. Hope we have some additional pens to use for. 
Typical problem in boom headset
Use your over-the-ear boom headset only on a well air conditioned room. For rest of the environment a in-the-ear headset is recommended.
How to keep change sorted in my pocket?
You may use the following methods :Coloured aluminium foilsIf you need to carry few coins, you can use different colour aluminium foils for different coins. Wrap your coins in the aluminium coils depending upon their value. You can choose your favorite colour and wrap coins which you use mostly in this.Polybag methodYou can use different colour small poly bags, which are easier to carry and you can large quantity of coins as compared to the first method.Different colours will help you to differentiate between coins of different values.
How to keep change sorted in my pocket?
You do have 4 pockets, and there are 4 common American coins: pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. You could designate one pocket for each type of coin.Alternately, you could make it a point of ONLY keeping one denomination of coin: only pennies, or only nickels, or only dimes, or only quarters. The others you could leave at the cash register or nearby.Alternately, you could make it a point of only keeping coins that are easy to tell apart by "feel" in your pocket. Quarters and nickels are easy to mix up, but quarters and dimes are significantly different. You could keep all your quarters and dimes, and leave the nickels and pennies at the cash register or the tip jar. Then when pulling coins out of your pocket, you could play "pocket pool" for a couple seconds to select just the quarters or dimes that you need, and then pull those out of your pocket.
Cleaning around a fixed wire retainer
I use a dental irrigator twice a day after brushing & flossing. It gets into spots that are hard or impossible to reach with a toothbrush or floss, including any pockets around the base of the tooth.
How can you get your car as cool as possible on a hot summer day without air conditioning?
Carry a spray bottle of water.  When you first get in, spray it on dash, seats, steering wheel, & other too-hot-to-touch parts.  Then when you get hot while driving, spray it on yourself.
How to avoid answer papers being flappy under a fan?
If there are multiple answer pages, you can clip them together with paper clips, binder clips, or bulldog clips. Being bound to each other, that will limit how much they can flap around in the breeze.
How can I clean my car headlights?
Method 1Use Baking Soda and soap. The method involves taking soap and mixing it with baking soda until you have a scouring powder like solution and then buffing the headlights with that. Rinse the cloth you use, between buffs and rinse clean with fresh water. The link says use Castile Soap and a mild soap is best. Things you need:Baking SodaSoap(Dish soap or Castile is fine)WaterRagBucket(for water)Method 2Use wet and dry sandpaper. This is a somewhat permanent method.Things you need:Wet and Dry sandpaper. Spray bottle with waterRinse water.Dry rags.Adhesive covering for the headlights.A buffering product for the headlights.I am not going to explain this method in detail, but in short you buff the headlight clean with the wet and dry sandpaper dampened with the spray bottle water. Then you buff the headlights with the buffering product and apply the adhesive. 
How can I clean my car headlights?
The answers above are good, but whatever you do, you need to add a UV coating once you're done. If you don't, you'll be right back where you started fairly quickly. The fogging is due to the breakdown of the original UV coating and consequent fading. I'm not sure what it costs, but I know I'll be buying it when I need to do mine.As for getting rid of the fading in the first place, toothpaste is good, and professional systems will do a better job. Depends on whether you want to apply the 80/20 principle to this and do it on the cheap, or if you want a real showroom finish.
How to get home after losing lugnuts?
You definitely don't want to hack a replacement for lugnuts, since it's a major safety issue. What you really need is more lugnuts.Luckily, you have some! Take some off the other wheels, and evenly distribute them between all four wheels. Since most consumer vehicles have 4-6 nuts on each (heavier vehicles tend to have more), you should be missing two at most from any wheel. Any you're missing two from, make sure the missing nuts aren't adjacent around the wheel.This should be fine as long as you aren't at maximum capacity for your vehicle (weight, not number of passengers). I wouldn't do this while towing or hauling anything, for example, and I'd probably try to stay below highway speed.To be honest, unless you have another vehicle at home, I'd recommend first driving to the store to get some more lugnuts. Either way, take it nice and easy, and get some more nuts to replace them as soon as possible.Note: If you have a very old vehicle (40+ years or so), the lugnuts on the left side wheels may be threaded differently from the ones on the right. If that's the case, you might just want to call someone for a ride, since you'd only have half the normal number of nuts on each wheel on the affected side.Note: You should probably also do something about the bear before removing the other lugnuts. You don't want to lose them, too. And pick up some bear mace or something after you get it fixed.
How to keep water from boiling over?
At the moment that it starts to boil over, lift it from the heat. This will usually stop the boilover. If possible, turn the heat down before you set it back on the heat again.If simply lifting it doesn't work, try blowing on it as you would blow on a hot cup of coffee. This stops the boilover (and will keep it stopped as long as you blow) giving you time to move the pot, turn the heat down, or otherwise deal with the issue. You may think that it won't work but next time you face a boiling-over pot, try it!

Finding a gold ring lost in the lawn
You could try raking the grass, with any luck the ring might hook onto one of the many tines on the rake and thus be retrieved.If it doesn't hook on, it should be easy to hear the metal on metal 'ding' noise once you've scraped over it.
Getting the stringy stuff off a clementine / tangerine easily?
Adhesive tape (like Scotch tape) or a lint roller should do the trick. Just press it against the stringy stuff and peel it off. But that seems unsanitary, whether it is or not. And the adhesive might not stick.An alternative would be to press a sticky food against the tangerine strings, then peel it/them off. The only sticky food I can think of at the moment is soft caramel. You could flatten a piece of soft caramel, press it against the clementine, peel it at the stringy stuff off, and throw it way. (The caramel flavor might even add something to the flavor of the clementine/tangerine!)
Finding a gold ring lost in the lawn
Go outside that night with a very strong flashlight or preferably a higher-intensity floodlight. With any luck, the glint of any metal object will stand out considerably compared to anything else you might find among the grass. Work systematically. Search the lawn one square at a time. You are much more likely to find something searching one square meter at a time rather than wandering aimlessly.
Finding a gold ring lost in the lawn
Obvious but expensive answer: wave a metal detector over your lawn. Maybe a friend has one you could borrow?
Getting the stringy stuff off a clementine / tangerine easily?
Rub it in a clean dish towel. The abrasiveness of the towel will pull off and hold the stringy parts.
Finding a gold ring lost in the lawn
First of all, do not assume it is in the garden unless you are absolutely certain. If there is any possibility it is somewhere else, then those other places must be systematically searched.Do not use a rake. Do not walk around on, or otherwise disturb in any way the search area. Randomly casting around for the object is a bad idea.The way to find the ring is to systematically search the search area. To do this with a plot of ground, like a backyard, what you should do is string it with a grid. Drive in wooden stakes around the perimeter of the area. Make sure the stakes are well outside anywhere the ring could have dropped. Next, pull twine around the stakes making a lattice pattern. Tie a heavy object to the twine and throw it across so you do not have to walk in the search area. When you are done you should have the yard divided into a grid, each cell being about 16 inches square.Once you have divided the search area into a grid, begin searching it cell by cell, marking each cell after you finish it. If your ring is in the search area, it is likely you will find it as long as you thoroughly search each cell. Also, check all branches and twigs in each cell; sometimes an object will catch on a twig.
What's the simplest way to put toothpaste back in the tube?
You could put your extra toothpaste in a ziplock bag. Then when you're finished with the regular tube cut a small hole in the corner of the ziplock bag with the extra toothpaste and squeeze out the toothpaste like that. You can also add a tip like people do for frosting a cake. Check out the images attached:
Tricks for opening very tight jars
Tap the side of the lid with the back of a knife.I have no idea why this works, but it does, and it is way easier than some of the other proposed methods.
How to prevent soda from fizzing upon opening
A couple of near misses in the answers above.The secret is to tap on the bottom of the can with a dense object, like a knife. If the can is badly shaken, tap more than usual. Sometimes at a party where there are no metal knives I have used large bottle openers. As long as the bottle opener has some heft to it, it will work.You do not need to bang the can. Just repeated sharp, light taps from a metal object. A key will not work because it is not heavy enough.
How can I get rid of the tiny fish-bone stuck in my throat upon eating fish?
A very easy method I've found is to eat marshmallows. You can use several mini ones or one or two big ones. Chew the marshmallows in your mouth, so that it becomes a sticky glob. Then swallow the glob. It should be sticky enough to grab the fishbone and drag it down your throat.A variation of this is to use bread and peanut butter. Put peanut butter on a piece of bread, let it be moistened by the saliva, then swallow.
Finding a gold ring lost in the lawn
If you have 5-10 year old sons, daughter, nieces and nephews (basically kids you trust with a ring), get a group of them together and tell them that whoever finds the ring in the grass will get $20 (or some other appropriate, parent-approved prize). Also have cake & ice cream for those who didn't find it.
Finding a gold ring lost in the lawn
Crows here in the Pacific Northwest find everything. I threw a loaf of bread squares onto my lawn one morning, trying to remember where I put my single car key. Voila, a crow buggered around and flipped the key so I could see it. Luckily he didn't use it for his nest.
How to clean my ear canal with something more reusable than a cotton swab?
What I heard from my ear specialist doctor is so simple that we almost forget about it. The human ear has a feature of self-cleaning, i.e. the wax will be propelled to the outside just by itself. However this self-cleaning process will not work if we push the wax back in to the outer auditory canal.Any mechanical device we may use has a high risk that it will push the wax back in to the ear which eventually will lead to a plug. Cotton tips are especially dangerous in this respect (when pushing too far they can even damage the eardrum).So what we only need to do is to remove the wax that is on the outside of the ear canal. To avoid pushing is back in we do have an in-built tool:Use your little finger to move it gently in circles around your ear canal. This will remove all wax that may sit there.The finger will be to big to push wax back into your ear but it is small enough to clean the outer side of our ear canal perfectly. Of cource we need to take care to have our nails cut short to avoid scratches that may lead to infections. In case you don't want the wax to sit on your finger you may wrap a tissue around it before cleaning.
How to carry heavy plastic bags?
A useful hack: Protect your fingersSo, the worst thing when walking is that the plastic straps can start cutting into your hands incredibly painfully. Normally this is not too bad, but sometimes it can really become too uncomfortable. In those rare cases I have wrapped my wallet through the plastic hole of the bag(s), thus giving a nice protected area. If you have an expensive wallet it's definitely not advisable, but with an old crappy wallet it really works quite well. The big advantage is that you do not need anything that you don't usually carry with you.The obvious: Distribute weightWhen walking make sure to have two bags where each arm carries a similar weight. When cycling make one bag heavy and another bag light. Carry/hold the heavy bag on the luggage rack whilst carrying the lighter bag in the hand you use for steering.
How can I get rid of the tiny fish-bone stuck in my throat upon eating fish?

Allergy relief without medicine?
Local honey.  Go to a farmers market/local farm/natural store in your area.  Try to find honey (preferably honey in the raw) that is farmed within 100 miles of you.  The closer the better.  The pollen in the honey will contain the things your allergic to (sounds counter productive) in a level that your body can handle, and will help you get over your allergies.  It may not completely get rid of them, but it will help.  Also helps with sore throat/cough.

I have a friend who wears a SCUBA mask with a HEPA filter on it when the birch trees are active. He looks like Darth Vader, but he experiences no allergies.
How to clean my ear canal with something more reusable than a cotton swab?
One strategy might be to wick the water out. Get a soft, somewhat thick string and stiffen it with starch. You can then push it into your ear canal and wick up any water you get from swimming. Use each end for either ear. Dry out the string between uses.Note that this will not actually dry the ear canal, it will just remove any puddled water. To fully dry the ear canal use 70% alcohol, one drop, after any excess water has been removed.
How to clean my ear canal with something more reusable than a cotton swab?
Put a few drops of isopropyl alcohol in your ear. The alcohol evaporates faster than water and has a lower surface tension, encouraging the water to come out. Wear swimmer's ear plugs so the water doesn't get in.
How to clean my ear canal with something more reusable than a cotton swab?
Use one of these:You can by it or make it yourself. It doesn't push the wax back into the ear and since it's rounded you will not hurt yourself.
How to clean my ear canal with something more reusable than a cotton swab?
Toilet paper works well for this:Take one sheet of toilet paper.Roll up one of the corners into a wick.Gently stick the wick in your ear. It will absorb the water. If you insist on reusability, use a thin cloth instead. A T-shirt or handkerchief will do. You won't be able to roll this into a really thin wick, but if you fold it twice you get a corner you can stick in your ear. To make the procedure more effective, lean over until your ear points straight down.

Allergy relief without medicine?
The best right now fix I've had is to wash your face and keep rinsing with clean water for a few minutes. This helps with the itchy eyes and removes irritants from your skin. Any other area of the body you can wash also helps. Best if you can actually take a shower and change into clean clothes, but the face wash is best for situations where that isn't possible. 
How to iron clothes at high temperature setting?
I don't know if it will work, but I heard ironing through a damp wash cloth will help to prevent color fade.If you are looking for creases in cloths (dress pants, etc.) then I can help you do it less often, which will also prevent color fade because you won't be doing it as often.Get some soap.  Any bar soap will work, but the little hotel soaps seem to work the best.  Iron a crease into the garment.  While it is still hot, turn it inside out and run the soap down the crease.  You want to make sure that some soap stays on the clothing.Turn it right side out and go over the crease again.  The soap acts like a glue and will melt into the crease.  You can often get 3 or 4 washes out of it before the soap lets go and you have to repeat the steps.Used to use this on my BDU's. Takes a little extra time in the beginning, but you save time in the long run by not having to iron every time you do laundry.

How to remove pigments from white clothes that have been accidentally laundered with strong colors clothes?
If the clothes can tolerate chlorine bleach, that should be effective, since they were white to start.Scrubbing small spots with dish-washing detergent and toothbrush works if the color is only a small area.
How to carry heavy plastic bags?
The most commonly suggest option would be to use a carabiner as @mkingsbu stated in his answer. This is great as an option, but it tends to be unevenly allocated as far as weight distribution goes. Your best bet is to go with something cylindrical. As you can see in the image below, it essentially takes the stress points out of the carrying/transportation of the plastic bags.A common tool I like to when I can't find anything myself, is simply a BIC lighter of mine, it does this well and allows me to carry the bag without straining my fingers.
Stop car doors from slamming against wall inside my garage
My answer assumes, that you already tried simply talking to them and it did not work and also, that you DO want them to exit the vehicle at exact this place.Since this is Lifehacks, not "How can I train my passengers to behave like I want", I would recommend taking steps that, even in the case of them smashing the door against the wall, the damage will be intercepted or minimal.You could install some kind of buffer, either at the wall or your door.A buffer on the car might make your car look ugly though, so this may be an issue for you.But the big pro is: it not only works in your garage, but in every public parking lot as well. Also, it's cheap (maybe $5-10).The con of this is that the buffer will absorb the damage for you and in doing so, it will wear off within some hundred usages.The alternative is a rubber buffer on the garage wall; a far more durable solution and it won't make your car ugly.A rubber impact bar can be bought in any hardware store for as cheap as the other solution. Compared to the car-bar, this solution is of high durability.
Stop car doors from slamming against wall inside my garage
Ask your passenger to get out of the car before you park the car. This also leaves you free to park it right next to the wall.For the passenger, this has the advantage they can open the door to its stop and easily get out of the car.   
How to maintain elasticity of rubber band like it was initially?
First of all, rubber band is an thermodynamic object which does not contain any potential energy if loose, this it's to be declared as "cold" if loose.If you stretch a rubber band, it warms up indeed and then, contains potential energy which is needed to get back in old state.Also, warm rubber bands are more elastic than cold ones.Like shown here.Due rubber bands wear of when getting overstretched, you should make them as elastic as possible before stretching and thus warm them up.Do not wrap them at your wrist if they're cold, better put them into your pocket or hold them in your hands for a moment.If they're warmed up, your wrist is a perfect storage due it keeps them warm.Make sure the rubber band is warm, before you wrap them around your hair. Do not store them at cold temperatures.And of course, higher quality is more durable.There's a german proverb:"Wer billig kauft, kauft zweimal, wer sparen will gibt Geld aus."If you buy cheap, you'll buy again. If you want to save money, pay more.

What is an effective way to clean stainless steel appliances without commercial products?
Isopropyl alcohol AKA isopropanol is very good at removing greasy marks from surfaces. Last time I bought it, I got it from a large pharmacists. Clean with soap and water first and when dry put a dab of neat isopropanol on a paper towel and rub the areas you want to get clean. Methylated spirits would work similarly but probably not quite as well. 
Dispose of sensitive paperwork
I could imagine, wetting and mashing the paper would help.Put all the paper in a water resistant container and add a fair amount of liquid (I'd use water, because soft drinks usually leave sticky residues).Mash the wet paper with your hands or feet or both (depending on the amount of paper and the size of your container)Let it dry and send it to paper recyclingAs long as the paper isn't extremely thick, it will be weakened by the water quite fast, thus making you able to mash it.I have not tested this, but from experience of having a wet sheet crushed, you won't be able to read anything off the paper afterwards.The only down-side I can think of is the drying time. It may take longer to dry a huge block of mashed paper than shredding it with a shredder that needs to cool down. Maybe you could put it in the oven at low temperature to speed this process up. Or maybe the recycling facility also accepts wet paper. Who knows?If you let it dry completely you may even end up with a more handy block of paper than a pile of sheets.

How can I clean my sticky keyboard?
Well anyway, the first step to cleaning is avoiding the habits that got it nasty in the first place - With the keyboard UPSIDE DOWN, give it some hard taps, to dislodge the dry crumbly stuff, an air blower can to squirt out the easily movable dry stuff.You can, ever so slightly, twist flex the keyboard as you shake/tap it.Wear GlovesFor the sticky, soda issues, again with the keyboard upside down, get a small sponge soaked in at least 70% rubbing alcohol and sop all over the keys with slight pressure, getting some alcohol in via the squeezing, but it immediately flows back out...depending on how long the soda was there, the sponge will show the icky effects but your keyboard will be sparkling clean again!

I make the passenger get out first, but even so, I have flat pack cardboard boxes previously used for various things leaning against the walls of the garage so I don't damage any of the doors myself when opening them in there. I did have to tape them flat - once, one flopped open and I couldn't get out of the driver's side, it stopped the door from opening wide enough.
How to remove pigments from white clothes that have been accidentally laundered with strong colors clothes?
The solution to this is to put everything white back through the wash immediately, before the items are dry, preferably on the hottest wash they can take. Having made my partner's cricket whites pale pink in a similar situation, running them back through straight away cleared it, but I have since adopted the use of those Colour Catcher things... I think they also make a colour run corrective for these situations. As its only socks, you might not want to wash those on their own... I'd try soaking in Vanish Oxyaction for 6 hours.

Remove ice from freezer / keeping it clean
My fridge came with a plastic wedge/scoop. Slide this along the wall and the ice breaks away in big chunks. This only works if the freezer walls are smooth.To make the process even easier, start by heating the inside of the freezer with an electric heater as suggested above (keep the heater away from the meltwater). After 15 minutes the ice will be considerably softer and easy to break away.Some people say there's a risk you'll break the walls, but that seems unlikely to me.    Another method would be to spray hot water on the walls with a garden hose, but that leaves the problem of getting rid of all the water. 
How to keep water from boiling over?
I keep a wooden clothespin in the kitchen. When I make pasta or rice, I clip the clothespin to the lid, creating a small gap between the lid and pan. With the lid closed, the pan would boil over. With the pin in place, the boilover doesn't occur (at the same heat setting).

Assuming you have a wall on both sides of your garage, you can cut a length of rope a foot or so (the exact length may vary) short of the width of the garage.  Securely fasten this rope to the driver's side wall of the garage.  Before letting your passenger out, thread the rope through the driver's side window and instruct the passenger to affix it to the handle on the interior of the passenger side door.  When they open their door, the rope will prevent it from opening fully and hitting the wall.
How to retrieve items from under a refrigerator?

Shred Office Paper gradually (as needed) for Compost BeddingIf you have space to compost, then shredding paper as you go could be helpful rather than a nuisance. (Shredded paper, cardboard, sawdust or leaves are commonly used to create layers within a bucket so it needs less cleaning and does not smell and need to be taken outside as quickly.)The only source on this that I can think of is the humanure handbook's sawdust toilet. If you follow that process, I think you can rest assured that no one will sift through your personal data.But you must have a correct portion of nitrogen to offset all the carbon in your paper.

How can one remove burned food from the inside of a pot?
Try boiling water in the pot for a period of time (ten minutes, perhaps?). Then, while the pot is still hot, pour out most of the water and gently scrub with a handled brush (so as not to burn yourself).  You may also want to add some liquid soap after you've poured out most of the water. If you add water at the start, before boiling, the suds will probably spill over the sides.

How to clean a water tank
answering the questions in order:"slippery/shiny layer" sounds like a biofilm, and there may also be layers of precipitates (e.g. iron or manganese oxides) embedded. Some of the organisms may be innocuous, but some could be pathogenic. There is a US EPA paper on the specific organisms found. Chlorine-based disinfectants (basically, hypochlorite bleach) and lots of scrubbing should get rid of the film.A sponge, perhaps on a stick should soak up any standing water after siphoning off most of it. However, sodium hypochlorite is safe to ingest in drinking water if sufficiently diluted, i.e. 5 to 10 milliliters of 1% sodium hypochlorite solution in 20 liters of water, so there is no problem if some is left after cleaning..

My mum had this problem and she found some spare pieces of thick wool carpet that were left over from when they refurbished and folded them over so they were double thickness and then stapled them to the wall . So the car door always had a soft landing - it worked well, no more scratches and dents!I'm sure most flooring places will sell you some very cheap off cuts (or even give them to you free) if you don't have anything suitable already.You need a heavy duty type wall stapler ideally or else you can use one of the builders glues or even ordinary screws (but then you need to protect the screw heads so they don't scratch)

How to make air-free ice?
Freeze it slowlyThe problem with freezers today is that they're just too fast. Still water doesn't have time to let all the air out before it's trapped in ice. By slowing it down, you can get clearer ice.One way to do this is by changing the setting on your freezer. Use something very close to freezing, say -1C or 30F. For most freezers, this will be the warmest setting. The downside to this is that it will affect everything else in the freezer as well. If you have food in there you'd like to keep colder, this probably isn't the method for you.Another way is by using something insulated. You can probably find a plastic or styrofoam cooler that will fit an ice tray (and fit in your freezer). Put your tray in it, and toss it in the freezer.Both of these things will cause it to take much longer to freeze. The one time I tried the freezer temperature method, it took about 24 hours for it to completely freeze two trays, but they were nice and clear. The cooler method probably takes longer, but I haven't tried that. I read online that a good cooler can keep water unfrozen for a few days. If that's the case, try it with the lid cracked a bit. This should speed it up some while still providing a good bit of insulation.

How to make air-free ice?
There are several methods described on this website and summarized here.  Disclaimer, I've not tried any of these except using purified water, which does work well.Use pure water. This method looks to get as much of the air and mineral impurities out of the water as possible before freezing, start with already distilled water. Filtered bottled water will work, or any water purified by reverse osmosis.Top-Down Freezing MethodUse a cooler to will insulate your ice cubes, forcing them to freeze slowly from the top down.Place your ice tray, mold or other freezing container at the bottom of the cooler, open to the top. Fill your tray or molds with water. Pour water into the bottom of the cooler, filling in around your ice tray or molds. This water will seal off your ice cubes, keeping cold air from freezing the sides or bottom.Place the cooler with the lid off in your freezer. Make sure your freezer is not set too cold—17-25°F should do it. Leave the cooler for 24 hours.away the ice around your tray or molds and remove your ice cubes.High-Temperature Freezing MethodSet your freezer to just below freezing, around 30°F or -1°C.  Fill an ice tray or mold with water and place put it in the freezer. Leave it to freeze for 24 hours. The slow freeze should force out any gasses and impurities, leaving you with perfectly clear ice cubes.Bottom freezing methodFill up a bowl with water then dump a lot of salt into it to prevent it from freezing then put it in the freezer. Be careful not to put too little water in the bowl or the freezing will release enough heat to warm up the salt water to 0°C before the ice cubes finish freezing. The colder the freezer is, the higher the concentration of salt needs to be to prevent the salt water from freezing. Leave the salt water in the freezer at least 3 hours to get really cold.Take the bowl of salt water out of the freezer to prevent the water in the ice cube tray from freezing from the top.Fill up an ice cube tray with water then float it on the salt water in the freezer which is denser than fresh water. The result is bubble free ice that is super strong and crack free because it froze without any trapped regions of water ever forming during the process.Boiling Method(added for the sake of completeness, I realize you don't want to boil water in your question).Boil the water twice. Boiling removes air bubbles from the liquid, allowing the water molecules to stick together even harder in the freezer.After boiling the first time, allow the water to cool. Then boil again.Keep the cooling water covered to prevent any dust from collecting on the surface.Cover the tray as it cools to keep particulate out.

I had some leftover vinyl siding (from having exterior siding installed).  I nailed it to the wall (interlocking as you would if you were installing it normally).  Works great and now I don't have to worry about how to store the extra pieces (encase an exterior piece gets damaged).  It lays very close to the wall, but still provides a fairly soft surface to bounce a door off of.  You might be able to ask for some scrap pieces if you see someone house getting sided.  Each piece should be at least a couple of feet.
Preventing smoke entering apartment when windows are opened?
You could try using a table fan like the one above near the commonplace window. I'm not exactly sure how the setup of your apartment is, but this technique may work. I use it at my place because the air is sometimes too still and it gets stuffy in my apartment.Another option could be to use a glass mounted exhaust fan that you could place on your window that faces West to pull the air out from the commonplace window. (I'm sure you'll find better looking alternatives than the one linked.)

Tricks for opening very tight jars
Tap the lid of the jar on a horizontal hard surface. Try and keep the bottle as horizontal as possible making sure the glass doesn't hit the surface.Repeat this about 4 to 5 times at while rotating the bottle so as to tap different points of the edge of the lid.Once this is done, you should be able twist the lid off easily.I've tried this technique multiple times with success every time using my marble kitchen counter as the hard surface. In case it doesn't budge, try tapping the edge of the lid a few more times.This technique will allow you to reuse the lid after the jar has been opened.
What is the best way to clean a stove?
The most common cleaner (not off the shelf) is citrus vinegar.It is very simple to make this, the only downside is that it takes 2 weeks of sitting to be completely effective.Place citrus peels (any type) in a glass jar (pack fairly tightly) and  cover with white vinegar.  Place lid on, and let steep for two weeks.   Strain out peels.Mix infused vinegar with an equal amount of water  and place in a spray bottle to use.SourceAnother method is to simply use Baking Soda & Table Salt. What you'll need for this is:1 part table salt1 part baking soda1 part waterMix them together and apply to the stove top and scrub away.If you want something right awayMy personal favourite is Straight Lemon Juice, it works wonders when removing the grease. Simply apply it directly to the stove top and scrub off the dirt.Alternatively, you could use straight vinegar, lemon juice or straight baking soda.

We have a mango tree too and every now and then we experience this. Try putting a printed sign on your wall that says:"The mangoes in this tree are private property. Should you really want one, just ask nicely. :)"
Bad kids stealing mangoes from my trees at home
I have seen people try to solve this annoying problem.Apart from putting the sign that @Carlo Borja suggested, try draping a net over the tree. This will hopefully prevent any stealing as any smart but bad kid would just understand that throwing rocks will not work.
How can I get rid of the tiny fish-bone stuck in my throat upon eating fish?
Eat lots of bread at once- it helps if you chew as little as possible- then the bread keeps together and helps "clean" the throat by dislodging any obstructions.for more see :http://www.dw.de/how-to-dislodge-a-fish-bone-stuck-in-your-throat/a-18145579
How to make air-free ice?
Use pure water. This method looks to get as much of the air and mineral impurities out of the water as possible before freezing, start with already distilled water. Filtered bottled water will work, or any water purified by reverse osmosis.Boil the water twice. Boiling removes air bubbles from the liquid, allowing the water molecules to stick together even harder in the freezer.After boiling the first time, allow the water to cool. Then boil again.Keep the cooling water covered to prevent any dust from collecting on the surface.Pour water into an ice tray or other mold and cover with a plastic wrap to keep out particles. Make sure that you have let the water cool a little bit before pouring it in the tray so that it doesn't melt the plastic. If you really want to impress, try making extra large clear ice cubes and ice spheres. Nothing like drinking a cocktail on one very large rock.Place the ice tray in the freezer. Leave it for few hours to freeze.Thats' It ... You have Done !!!

Maybe you can house your dogs closer to the MANGO tree. A tall fence sounds like it should work but will cost quite a bit of money. I would write a sincere notice, perhaps something like this:Please do not steal my MANGO fruit. You are tresspassing and stealing fruit from my yard is a punishable offense. I have notified the police of tresspassers and they will be looking out for any offenders.
Stop car doors from slamming against wall inside my garage
The mid 90s BMWs come with a rubber strip of trim that protects the doors (image not mine, but similar).  I don't know why more car companies don't do thathttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/BMW-E36-convertible.jpg
How to make a NEW fountain pen write smoother?
A rough nib can be caused by a number of factors.The width of the nib is always key.  An extra-fine or fine nib will always be scratchier than a medium or broad. The Hero pens tend to be mostly extra fines, and they will simply have a scratchier character; even the classic pen it's modelled after, the Parker 51, has scratchier XF nibs than M nibs.The first one to look at is the "set" of the nib--whether the tines are properly aligned and even. Usually, bending the tines to make them align properly, and not be angled but parallel to each other may be all that's required to get the nib back into good shape.  Some people write with pressure in such a way as to disturb the set of the nib, so you may have to repeatedly do this for maintenance. Examining the tines under magnification with a loupe can be useful for this. (See: Richard Binder's nib smoothing workshop notes (PDF)).A second factor may be the tipping. A fountain pen nib, to write smoothly, should be tipped with a harder material that's been rounded and polished.  Cheaper fountain pen nibs may not be tipped, or the tipping may have broken off and left a porous surface.  In these cases, using a very fine, mild abrasive surface (like 10,000 grit) to smooth the tipping may work, but can be difficult to do correctly without adding an edge.  Light, circular strokes, on a wetted grinding surface may help.  Sometimes, the nib may be past this type of repair and may require replacement or retipping.Inkflow has to do with the air/ink interchange and capillary action. If the pen writes too wetly, drips, or blots a lot, chances are good, the exchange is too heavy.  If the pen skips or runs dry a lot, then the exchange is too light. The air/ink exchange is generally controlled by the fit of the nib against the feed (the plastic the nib rests on). Dried, hardened ink in the feed channels is usually the #1 culprit of a pen that won't start or that skips. Proper fountain pen ink is water-soluable dye. When the water evaporates, the solid pigment can cake and block ink and air passage. A simple soak with water should dissolve the dye, but may take a very long time, depending on how thin the channel is and how accessible it is from soaking. A pen like the Hero is liable to take a good long time (a few days), and will require flushing by filling and emptying the reservoir multiple times.  You do not want to soak metal parts (may corrode), and you do not need to use acidic or alkaline solutions (may affect the plastic), and you don't want to soak it in ink because you may pollute fresh ink in the bottle with crud from the old ink (fungus, sediment).  Time and water will always clear ink from a fountain pen.If flushing doesn't help, then the set of the nib against the feed may be the culprit, but it will require disassembly and adjustment, and this is best done by someone who knows how to service the pen.

How to make air-free ice?
There are lots of ways to make nearly-clear ice. I will not discuss those.There are two basic methods to make perfectly clear (gas-free) ice. The easiest by far is to buy a small bar ice maker, also called a "clear ice" maker. Such ice makers are used by bars and restaurants. For about $200 you can get a small one that fits on a counter top. They work by using a cold plate at the bottom and circulating the water. This causes the ice to freeze from the bottom up. Air escapes out the top.The do-it-yourself method is a lot more work. The idea is the reverse of the cold-plate method. Put a well-insulated box (like a small cooler or styrofoam box) in the freezer and make a cube tray that will just fit it in the bottom. The idea is that you are going to freeze the ice from the top down. The insulated box prevents any cold from reaching the water, except from the top. In the bottom of each cube cell make a hole. As the ice freezes downwards, it will push the air out the hole. You have to take the ice out as soon as it reaches the bottom of the tray, otherwise you will have bumps on the bottom of the ice if it is allowed to grow through the holes.
How to control my sinuses when I lose my handkerchief
Find an empty open space (preferably with no one looking)Close one nostril with your finger, inhale deeply and then shoot the snot out of the other nostril. Make sure you shoot it out with as much force as possible to prevent your face from getting messed up.Repeat the process with the other nostril.If you have a bottle of water with you, you could use that to clean up after you're done.Additionally, for blocked sinuses, I would suggest doing a nose wash every morning.

How to fish electric wire from one end to other end of a long pipe
The best solution is to use the tool designed for the task: a 'fish tape' or wire puller. This is a flexible tape or wire designed to be pushed through electrical conduits. Push the tape through, hook your electrical wires to the tape, and pull the tape back, dragging the electrical wires along.  In a pinch, you can try this (works only if your conduit has no wiring boxes or branches):  Find an old audio cassette you don't mind destroying. Pull the tape from the cassette. Get a vacuum cleaner, put its nozzle on one end of the conduit. Thread the tape into the other end, and let the vacuum cleaner pull it through. Attach a fishing line or other thin thread to the tape. Pull that through. Attach a thicker line to the thin line and pull that through. Use the thicker line to pull the electrical wires through. 
How do I measure my own blood pressure with the manual blood pressure machine?
Performing the trial on yourself has the benefit that you can actually physically experience the points where your blood pressure is at it's highest and at it's lowest. I would recommend that you get your blood pressure measured via a digital device at a pharmacy, elsewhere, and observe how your body responds during the trial.You should physically experience two distinct phases, one where you feel that the internal stress on your blood vessels has peaked, after which you begin releasing the pressure and experience a different state where you feel dizzy and weak from the sudden onset of oxygen. It is when you experience these two states that your systolic and diastolic readings are taken.Wikipedia references that, to increase accuracy, for 5 minutes before the reading, one should sit upright in a chair with one's feet flat on the floor and with limbs uncrossed. The blood pressure cuff should always be against bare skin, as readings taken over a shirt sleeve are less accurate. During the reading, the arm that is used should be relaxed and kept at heart level, for example by resting it on a table.
How to get rid of rats in house with/without killing it
There are humane traps such as Havahart. Peanut butter is very attractive for rodents. BTW, I have stayed in a national park which had a mouse problem in cabins... When I went to bed, a humane trap had gotten one critter, so I left a pencil for it to nibble, rather than the hard wire cage. In the morning, it had two more buddies awaiting a trip into the woods.
How to cool a car down quickly
There are two hot things to deal with: SURFACES and AIRAIR has pretty much one best solution, exchange the air. Opening one door can take a long time if you're just waiting passively for the air to covect out. You can actually see the hot air if you look on a hot day for the air shimmer or (even cooler) watch the shadow of the door you've opened. If you have passengers opening the passenger side the smart thing to do is coordinate opening your door before they get in and leave it open as they enter, this gives air time to enter from the windward size and exit from the leeward. You can turnover the air in a car in a few seconds with even slight wind this way and if you're sly about it the passenger may never know. I do this a lot. If it's just you getting into the car it's a little tricky to open opposing doors. One possibility is to have a door and sunroof open to get crossflow but if it's a power sunroof opening it can take too long and put strain on your battery. If you are alone and have no convenient sunroof then you may have to resort to the old "swing around a magazine" approach or some other inelegant way to move the air although since you're alone in this case nobody should see :)SURFACES are harder to cool because they have both more thermal mass and lower thermal dissipation (air is an insulator but convection actually exchanges the air which increases cooling speed by factors of 100). My usual solution for surfaces is to pick a couple important ones and change the surface into something that doesn't gather or convey heat to the user as well. This is a good reason for wood steering wheels or certain types of steering wheel and seat covers. Choices all depend on your preferred looks and textures as well as which surfaces get hot enough to be worth fixing.There are a lot of fine variations here (like maybe a small battery fan to move the air). I look forward to useful additions in the comments.
How to cool a car down quickly
There are solar powered fans that will circulate air through your car without draining the battery. Not sure how well they work.You should also be using one of those reflective screens inside the windshield - they're a bit of a hassle to put in and take out each time you park, but worthwhile just in keeping your car interior from deteriorating prematurely.You could also try to park in the shade, or go in the evening.As far as cooling the car down quickly, simply rolling the windows down and driving for a few minutes is probably the most efficient way to do it. The car will get a lot hotter than the air outside, even on a hot day.

How can I package 3 large boxes together into one shipment?
You generally want to keep your new construction as cube-like as possible.In your case, this would result in a 24" x 30" x 18" box.If you have cardboard sheets available, use these as struts at the 3x6" sides to place the boxes between. Use tape or whatever you have around to keep it together. If you use rope or something similar, make sure to put the first layer on the sheets. The sheets will prevent (most of) the damage to the actual packages.Stick the label to one of the cardboard sheets and voilà, you got yourself a package.
Grey water reuse into back of toilet?
I found it hard to find a good picture of a reservoir. This one from wikipedia isn't great but it will suit.  sourceMost toilet reservoirs look similar to this. The actual parts may vary but the function should be the same. You have a swimmer (1) which will "tell" the toilet when it's full, by floating on the water, releasing the pressure knob 11 when the favoured water level (10) is reached and thus stopping the filing of the toilet. If you drain the toilet by flushing (8) the stopper 6 opens to let the water urn out. With this, the swimmer goes don, pressing on the button (11) and refilling the toilet. If you put extra water into the reservoir it will fill, until it reaches the opening next 5. Any more water will drain through 7 into the toilet. Therefor in a standard toilet, there is no risk in overfilling the reservoir. BUT: Please note, that water tank from different sources can be filled with a lot of minerals (not in the case of a dehumidifier, since it's nearly distilled water) or microbiological contaminations. These can grow in your reservoir, producing a biofilm which will start smelling/ be unhygienic etc. So please have an eye on the cleaning schedule.

Sunburn Soothing and Removing Tips and Tricks?
You can try the following:Cool MilkSoak a wash cloth in cool milk and keep in soaked until the wash cloth gets completely saturated with cold milk. Let the excess milk drain off. Now, drape the wash cloth around the affected part.Cucumber, Rose Water and Lemon Juice PackThe acidic property of lemon acts as a natural bleach in removing tan and fighting pimples.  The cucumber juice and rose water acts as cooling agents for soothing the blemished skin. Take a table spoon each of cucumber juice, lemon juice and rose water and mix in a bowl. Apply with cotton on tanned areas, wait for 10 minutes and wash off with cold water. Apply this pack every day after you get back home from the sun.You can also use Aloe Vera gel.Caution: I am not sure how lemon will work if your face skin gets tanned. So don't include lemon if your face skin is tanned.
How to cool a car down quickly
Use a magazine or (better) sheet of still board held at angle in air stream as an air deflector - 45 degrees or so from forward facing with leading edge into wind while driving works wonders (This may or may not violate Oz regulations :-) ). In the days of "quarterlights" the same effect was achieved by rotating them about 135 degrees from closed so the blunt front edges protruded into the air flow.Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!And it makes YOU cool immediately while the car interior follows. | Small solar powered window fans do not have enough airflow in hot sun - even in NZ. Ask me how I know. Something I haven't tried but intend to is to enable either the airconditioning fan or a suitably larger in-window unit to get useful air changes. Battery life needs watching.Leaving all windows somewhat down works quite well. This adds a security hazard. I've seen lock-in grills that provide substantial open spze and which slot over window glass and into top of frame. Wind down - insert-wind up to lock in place. Probably very effective.Tasteful foil covered whole of windscreen fold out sheets have their place. try this: Stand somewhere say 1 floor up as close to vertically above car as possible. Look down onto car. Be amazed what % of total projected looking-up area is in glass. I'd guess at over 50% in the car you show above. Effectively reducing that area with window screens is going is going to help.

Dehumidify a room for drying laundry
An electric dehumidifier would reduce humidity, but would not necessarily be more efficient than a clothes dryer.Calcium chloride is sold as a dehumidifier, but it quickly "fills up" with water, forming a semi-liquid mess, so it would be of no help for your application.If you have a furnace-room where there is a hot water heater or furnace that runs most of the time, humidity is usually lower there because of the heat and the airflow. 
Bad kids stealing mangoes from my trees at home
Prune the treeImmediately after harvest this year, prune the tree away from the wall.  Make sure that all the branches are well inside the wall, and lower to the ground.  By making the tree less visible, and requiring people to completely climb over the fence you'll discourage most random casual theft.Further, the tree should fruit more productively over time if it is well-pruned, and should you lose additional fruit to theft, it won't impact you as significantly.Plant another treeAnother tactic is to plant another mango tree, thus producing twice as much fruit as you have now, allowing you to freely give the fruit away without worrying too much about whether permission was obtained.Extend the fence upAdding another 2-3 feet of lattice, wire, or bamboo fencing on top of your existing wall may be permissible (check your local building codes).  Lightweight and inexpensive, it should be easy to install.  Because it's not heavy duty, climbing over it would be an act of destruction, and will discourage many people from attempting.The extension will also limit visibility, and make rock-throwing less successful.Pinch buds at beginning of seasonWith a few minutes work a day at the beginning of the season, you can remove the flowers or fruit buds from the side of the tree that overhangs past the fence, and locations that are easy to get to from the fence.  Just remove the buds or flowers by pinching and twisting.The remaining fruiting locations will typically do even better than usual, as the tree will expend most of its energy on the surviving buds.  
Dehumidify a room for drying laundry
Removing humidity from the air is an energy intensive process.  Further, while your clothes will dry faster in a lower humidity environment, they will still dry in a humid environment.Increasing the airflow, even on humid days, will significantly speed up drying.  The clothes are still more damp than the air, so moving more air past them will remove water from them more quickly.Fans are much less expensive to operate than dehumidifiers and heaters.  Put the clothes in an area where you can move air into and back out of the room.  If you have two windows in the drying room, that would be best - have one fan pulling air into the room via one window, and the other fan blowing air out of the room via the other window.If you only have one window, pull air from the door into the room, and then blow it out the window.If your room doesn't have two openings to increase the airflow, set up an oscillating fan near the one opening that alternately blows air out of the room and pulls air into the room. Alternately, if you have forced air heating/cooling, you can turn the fan of that system on and it will circulate the air through the room into the rest of the house, where you can ventilate the more humid air outside.

Where should a fan be aimed for maximum cooling of a room with one opening?
This depends on your environment. If the temperature is cooler outside the room blow the air into the room with the fan either in the doorway or just outside it to get the cooler air into the room. If the room is cooler than outside close the door. If they are the same temperature it won't matter. I've found that blowing cooler air up and at angles to the walls helps keep the whole room cooler since it circulates throughout the room and helps keep the hot air at the ceiling from getting really hot. 
Clean walls without removing its paint
Paint is usually hard to clean unless you have special paints. Some things you can try are: Using sponges not cloths. This promotes dabbing not rubbing which removes paint. Use mild soaps or even no soap. Yes, dish soap is good for grease removal, but it is not good for paint. So use mild soaps and try to extract the oil from the paint. Using flour or cornstarch on the wall helps drag the oil out and then dabbing clean with a wet sponge works. Not using soap at all helps keep paint intact. Lessen exposure to moisture on the paint to as short as possible and try not to rub or dab paint very much. Also, try not to wait to treat stains clean them immediately. 
Where should a fan be aimed for maximum cooling of a room with one opening?
Since there is only a single opening, air would have to flow both in and out of the same passage. To direct the coldest air into the room, place the fan at bottom.

Avoiding sunlight in school assembly area
First, I'm wondering what you'd be planting these climbers or creepers in - they'd need to be in the ground to make any size, pots will restrict them too much. Also, your idea of nets or rods for climbers won't work - the weight of the climbers will pull down the support system, probably on top of everyone's heads. You can build a solid wood pergola and then add climbers, but if the ground there is solid paved or concreted, you'd need to make holes in it for the foot of the pergola and also to be able to plant climbers. If you have to make holes in it anyway, why not plant a few trees for natural shade.Otherwise, some sort of large awning suspended across from the top building to the other.UPDATED ANSWER; You've said you'd be planting creepers in large pots on the first floor and having ropes strung across for them to cling to. The trouble with plants is, they always want to grow upwards, not sideways. This means they need tying in or persuading to grow along something, and that won't be possible suspended in air. You may get a branch to go along a rope, but the distance you want to cover will be unachievable (if your picture is of the actual area) because the plant will be restricted in its growth by the pot, even if its a large pot. Lastly, as I said before, weight will be an issue - let's suppose you had open soil on your second floor, and it was deep, meaning there's plenty of root room for a creeper, the weight as it grew would make it a danger to anyone below because it is only held up by some rope or mesh.

How can I make flying insects leave?
Some ways that might work are: You could make then sleepy. But I don't know a product up for this yet, beside maybe smoke. Having a fruity or other  scent by the windows so that they are attracted to them. This way though this might attract bugs back into the room. Have a fan blowing at the window. While this is a waste of energy it makes it harder for the bugs to come in the room and more apt to fly with the current of wind. You could actually put the fan behind them, so that they have fly in the direction of wind. Get bug traps so that you can catch and release them later. There are a variety to choose from so you don't have to worry about inadequacy. Scaring them into the traps could be a good trick.Stopping them from entering is better, better netting on windows, caulking holes and bug repellents are good choices for this. 
How to wake up for work easier during winter?
The obvious way would be to improve your environment: get your room to an agreeable temperature before you get up. If you have central heating, this is easy: just add a programmable thermostat. You can also get electric space heaters with a timer built in.Adding a simple timer to an existing space heater is also possible, but watch out: electric heaters draw a lot of power, make sure your timer is rated for that.  What helped me was an alarm clock that contains a light: before the scheduled wakeup time it switches on at a low intensity, gradually getting brighter over ~30 minutes. This simulates a sunrise and stimulates the natural waking cycle. 
How to wake up for work easier during winter?
I would say to:Set your readied clothes next to your bed. This way you don't get so cold getting dressed. Therefore, you won't dread getting up. Heat your room appropriately. If your room is cold you will have a hard time leaving the warmth of the bed. Go to bed earlier. If you are rested you will be more apt to get up on time. Also, start a good routine. Have something you like to do every morning waiting for you, this will make it easier to get up. Better Answer:Set a couple of alarms around the room this way by the time you turn them all off you will be awake. Have the alarms loud and set them slightly earlier than you need to get up so that you account for the time you will lay in bed. Also, drink coffee before you have to get up to make it easier. If you have to get up at 7:00a drink the coffee at 6:00a or 5:30a. Have the coffee next to your bed in a thermos. To add to my above response and taking slightly from another answer having alarms that include light, sound and movement(vibration) help. The vibrating alarm would sit next to you, but the light ones can sit throughout the room. In conclusion, I don't think there is any Lifehack for lack of motivation :) But I did try to help.

Some ways you could do this is:Picture LinkUse a fitted sheet instead of a blanket, this way you can sit stuff in the corners and they there snuggly, plus they are protected from the sand. Sand will stick to a wet cooler, but not with this method. From Here:Just turn up the corners a bit and you can keep your cooler and other  items safely away from all of that sand. You can also lay out without  worries of sand being all over you when you head home. Plus, sheets  are a bit larger than most beach towels so you’ll have loads of room  for picnicking or generally enjoying the fun and sun.Other Methods are:Waterproof Yoga mats. As these are easier to clean, also it is so small that you body will keep it from blowing away. But this method is not the best.

When we had this happen, we strapped a flame to a broom handle and burned the laces. You could use a butane torch like we did or attach some sort of long match to it. We just duct taped it to the handle, started the flame and lifted it up to the laces. Down in seconds. On the flip side if you're worried about using fire or want the shoes intact you could try knocking the shoes off with the broom handle alone. If the wire is too high, tape multiple brooms together, just make sure to use lots of duct tape and make sure you have enough overlap of brooms. 
How can I make flying insects leave?
I've noticed that big flies, bees, wasps and hornets tend to be attracted by light sources when trapped inside a room. So I usually try to roll down the rolling shutters of all the windows save one (and switch off any internal light source, especially on not-so-sunny days), which I leave open. Usually the insects find their way out fairly easily and quickly (especially bees and big flies), often without me being forced to "encourage" the bugs on their way out.Sadly this won't work for those annoying small house-flies which keep flying around in circles! Oh, well, you can't have everything!
How to wake up for work easier during winter?
This is what I do and it's been working.  The two issues with waking up in winter are:  1) cold  2) day light For heat, I just set my thermostat to warm up more than normal 30 mins before waking up.  I use a NEST thermostat, so it's easy to program that in. For the lack of daylight in winter, I use a Philip wake up light. It gradually increases the light brightness to mimic a sun rising.  By the time it's fully bright you will be awake and refreshed. 
Phone-line tennis-shoes
Not everyone has these handy, but a pellet rifle with a well placed shot or two could cut the laces and drop the shoes down.  Might even be fun target practice provided it's not in a busy/populated area with houses around. Obvious cautionary noted about missing the target.It would need to have a relatively high speed (fps) and I'd use pellets, not BBs (the sharper the better); ammo options.
How to clean hands after fishing
Copied from WikiHow:Try one of the following:Cut a fresh lemon into wedges. After you are finished handling the fish, squeeze the lemon onto your hands, rub your hands together, and  rinse with water. Squeeze liquid hand-sanitizer onto your hands. Rub  your hands together till dry. Rub your hands with toothpaste, then rub  together, and rinse under water.

If it's any consolation, Business Insider has ranked BoA as one of The 8 Worst Companies For Customer Service.
How do I make my smartphone battery last longer?
In addition to the steps mentioned by @MrPhooky, following are regularly usable practices which won't restrict your frequent use of phone.Use a complete black background/wallpaper. Screens when black consume less battery.Switch off any keypad tones/vibration/haptic feedback. They are generally set to full volume from factory.Switch off GPS. For location update, switch to something like battery saving mode in location settings.Switch to adaptive brightness, instead of a fixed brightness setting.If travelling long distances where network state changes frequently, switch to flight mode. That way you can use your phone offline & come back online with a tap whenever need to use network.Further, avoid overcharging your phone; don't go to sleep plugging the charger. Also, contrary to @nicael, allow your phone to completely drain battery once in a month or two. This helps.
How to swim before work (wet towel and clothes problem)?
Drop the wet clothes at a laundry on your way to office. Pick them up while returning. Not cost-effective though, I can't think of a better solution for the wet towel.
How to swim before work (wet towel and clothes problem)?
Some pools provide towels to their swimmers, and also provide spinning things that quickly dry bathing suits. It might be worth looking for such a place.If this pool is your only option, can you hang up your bathing suit and damp towel at the office, perhaps on a coat hook or the like? I would probably hang up the suit first, then put the towel over it so other people don't see the suit. Even if you then put a coat over all of that, they will dry and air a little so they will not get musty and smelly.

Dry yourself and your swimwear using a hairdryer or hand-dryer at the pool. Then you won't need a towel.
How to swim before work (wet towel and clothes problem)?
You could:Try wearing less clothes and wear clothes that dry faster. This way there are less clothes to dry and the clothes dry faster. You could try wringing the clothes out and spreading them across your bike, as you ride or even after. This way they can dry as you go to work(or not), and there might be a place with good ventilation where you can hang them to dry further.You may use both of these methods, they should work better together. Note: At the office if the clothes are still not dry you can try to iron them dry or set in front of a fan draped over a chair, coat rack, etc. 
Comfortable Ways of Riding a Bike Barefoot
You could use:Picture Link.Sponges. I have learned to use large sponges and double them up to make softer cushions. You can also wet the sponges to make them more comfortable and cool. These are also cheap and they can attach to pedals in may different ways: plastic ties, glue them, rubber bands, etc. Here is a Instructable on how to do it, if you are unsure. Note: If the sponge depicted is to hard for your feet, then you are more than welcome to get another. I know that softer bath sponges or even foam cushion material is good. When in doubt you can always cover it in memory foam or other foam pads. The sponge depicted is just a example, that may be to rough for your feet. 
Ways to stop your Beach blanket from blowing away
I used to bury the edges of the towel in the sand so the wind can't get under it any more. On a windy day, add more sand.It's impossible not to get sand everywhere anyway, so there's no point in trying to keep the towel clean. 
Comfortable Ways of Riding a Bike Barefoot
My first thought - there are pedals made specifically for this and if this is going to be a long term thing they are worth checking out. Now for the hack- I've seen people who ride longboards around campus barefoot, and they covered their boards with carpet. This would be pretty simple to modify that idea and cover your pedals with carpet, much like the sponge suggestion, and if you don't have leftover carpet you could go by a carpet store and see if they have leftover scraps you could have. Now for my warning, it is not just the pedal you need to protect your feet from. If you were to crash barefoot you can expect some damage to your feet so I don't recommend biking without real shoes on. Ok. Warning finished. Have fun riding. 
Empty bin with bag that is too heavy

How to swim before work (wet towel and clothes problem)?
Get a locker at the gym that you can leave things in during the day. Leave your towel & swim suit hanging there during the day and pick them up (mostly or completely dry) on the way home.Use a swimmer's towel. They work very well when wet, yet wring out and dry quickly. Still leaves the suit wet, though.Get a large Zip-lock™ (or other brand of sliding zipper bag), seal the wet stuff in it during the day, and throw it in the wash/dryer when you get home. It will likely get stinky during the day, but it won't bother your office mates & you can deal with it in the privacy of your house later.

The sponge is actually a good and bad idea.It's green area may hurt your feed a lot.I would go for old socks zipped, just like the sponge image.If you don't like to throw away socks, then you can use an old cloth rag.I said old, not dirty. I would prefer a clean one.If you fall, you have something to, at least, clean off the blood.
How to Fix a Hole in your Waterproof pool?
What you can do is:Use a Waterproof Tarp. Tarps can be used to line the pool so that the water does not flow out the hole. In many cases I have used the tarp to line a friends truck, hole or even a large container. This effectively makes anything a pool. Shower curtains(waterproof), tablecloths(waterproof ones) or even waterproof bed sheets and mattress covers can be used. Plus, if you dig a pool hole your pool can be as big as you like it to be. This is a interesting idea, and can be used with logs, or other structures if you dont have enough hay. 
Comfortable Ways of Riding a Bike Barefoot
Some time ago and in certain places, budget pedals were made with rubberized surfaces. They were quite comfortable to ride barefoot out of the box. I have no idea if such designs were popular on the West - and ofc they may or may not fit your modern bike. I'm from Poland and such pedals were the norm here 15-20 years ago, but here's a discussion showing a much older bike made in USSR with similar, smooth rubberized pedals: http://forumrowerowe.pl/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=19622 I think it's worth taking a look at flea markets. As you can see, foot rests on 2 rubber pads and middle iron bar that has no sharp edges either. Of course they don't hold to the shoe as good as jagged ones, and are dangerously slippery when wet./edit: I've found what they're called in English. It's "rubber platform pedals", often called "commuter" or "Dutch style" - and seem to be available pretty much everywhere dirt cheap ($10-20).
How to clean hands after fishing
Stainless steel - its worth buying a stainless steel bar or tablet, sometimes called stainless steel soap; these are sold for removing garlic, onion and fish odours from the hands. All you need to do is put your hands under running water for a minimum of 30 seconds, rubbing the bar all over your hands and fingers at the same time, with or without soap, doesn't matter.  I imagine plunging your hands in the river or whatever you're fishing in whilst using the bar will work too. Any stainless steel object will do though, its just easier to use the soap tablet shaped bar - I used a stainless steel ladle in a friend's house once after chopping garlic. They definitely work for garlic, never tried it for fishy smells, but they are sold for that purpose too.
Comfortable Ways of Riding a Bike Barefoot
As a variation on "rubber platform pedal" I can suggest a very minimalistic solution of rod-only pedal.I have seen many people ride like that, both barefoot and with sandals/flipflops, in poorer countries/areas purely because their "rubber platform pedals" have broken off, I have also seen hipsters ride that due to the minimalistic look (viewed from the side, the bicycle appears to have no pedals what so ever).The rods are usually quite slippery, but that's actually ok when combined with a flip-flop as the the flip-flop will slide off the pedal before it slips off foot.After a while you will develop a technique to position your foot firmly in the centre so it doesn't slip either way.You also need to take care not to apply too much torque - as the contact area is smaller, it would begin to hurt sooner or later, so this works best on a bike with multiple gears or low fixed gear.Something like this:
Removing a planter from inside a planter
You could buy dry ice to put in the inner planter, but that might cost more than the planters.Instead, put the outside planter in a large pot of boiling water, plugging drain holes so the inner one doesn't get hot too quickly. This should expand the outer one so it drops off without struggle. Let me know if that works.BTW, this technique is used to install cylinder liners (sleeves) in internal-combustion engines, sometimes using liquid nitrogen to chill the liner before putting it in the engine block.
Smell bad but no deodorant
I don't use deodorant because it makes me itch. For years I've been using Hibiclens which is 4% chlorhexidine surgical scrub.  Pharmacies carry it, WalMart, etc.  There are other brands of chlorhexidine scrubs. The vet may have sent your animal home with Novalsan.  Hibiclens is easy to find and it keeps other areas like navel and feet from smellings.  Smelly feet can be corrected. It's a disinfectant not an antibiotic. Sometime I just wipe some on my underarms with toilet paper.  After a while you might not need to use it every day. Chlorhexidine is also in oral rinses. I make a homemade version of the oral periodontal rinse PerioRx and our dentist always remarks on how little build up we have.  It inhibits the formation of the "dental pellicle" by bacteria which is their first step in attaching to your teeth.  200 ml of cheapest vodka, 4 ml of peppermint oil, few packets of some sweetener and add 25 ml Hibiclens and fill to liter with water. Vary as you wish, but real PerioRx is 0.12% chlorhexidine with 11.6% alcohol.  (I make ours a bit stronger usually and the peppermint helps kill its slightly soapy taste.)  Sometime I dab a bit of Hibiclens on my teeth and floss.  Small skin cuts seem to heal better after cleaning with it.  In thinking about the question below I realized the place I often have long contact with the full 4% solution is on my feet. I've never had a bad reaction. I don't get fungal infections, my toenails are in good shape, used socks don't smell bad.  I've found the easiest way to use it is to put some in an empty eye drops bottle.  (The solution is bright pink and can't be confused with the original eyedrops.) These droppers have a nipple like tip that fits between toes.  I keep the dropper where I generally sit to put on socks and I just use it like a marking pen on my nails and between my toes.               
How can I get the smell of garlic off my hands?
I noticed a kitchen supplies site that had a small egg shaped object made of stainless steel for the purpose of removing garlic smell.  Apparently you rubbed the stainless in your hands.  Since we found that steel wool pads made of stainless steel last better than Brillo types, we use that in the kitchen so we started touching our stainless steel wool to our hands after cutting garlic. It seems to work. If your sink is stainless steel that may be an easy way to try it out. This link explains why stainless works
How can I get rid of my sneakers' stench?
Wash the shoes in chlorhexidine surgical scrub disinfectant.  The brand called Hibiclens is common.  (WalMart has it.) You need to bump off the evil smelling bacteria you're carrying. Wash your feet with it and Use it on your armpits too and that can remove odors there, as well. 
Comfortable Ways of Riding a Bike Barefoot
The uncomfortable barbs on the pedals are there to make secure contact with the shoes that prudent people wear when riding bike.  You might try wrapping the pedals with Velcro tape which is available in rolls, probably fuzzy side out. I use a garden Velcro for lots of other things and some have been coverings. You could pad the pedal with cloth (perhaps wrap an old sock around the pedal) and then wrap the Velcro around that.If you don't have rolls of Velcro I thought maybe duct tape over the pedal's barbs would help.One could even fold some duct tape to make a loop on the pedal big enough to slip your foot in, then put tape through the loop onto the pedal to secure it.  
How to make air-free ice?
Make a block of ice much larger than necessary cut it into pieces. Discard the ones from the centre. The freezing process pushes air towards the centre of the block so the outside of the ice ends up air-free enough to be optical quality.Source: http://wildwoodsurvival.com/survival/fire/ice/rb/rbfirefromice3a.html

How to Fix a Hole in your Waterproof pool?
Most people have bikes and should thus have a bike tube repair kit. Follow the instructions and you can fix the hole. Basic instructions are these, but if the kit has instructions you should follow those. Take some sandpaper or something else to the area around the hole, scuff the surface to ensure proper glue adhesion. Put glue on both the hole and the patch, you can use a piece of bike tubing as a patch, but make sure to scuff it if you do. Let the glue sit for a couple of minutes until it becomes tacky. Press both pieces together for a few minutes to ensure good adhesion. 
How to decrease hold time for customer service calls?
I hate talking to computers on the phone. I use the trick mentioned in the previous answer... I button mash (That IS the technical term, yes) until I overload the system and it boots me out to a human being. However, I have found, once you are within the appropriate queue (redirected into the right department), if you try this trick again the systems are smarter and this doesn't help at all. This trick possibly even pulls you out of line to talk to a person, and then places you back in at the end of the line restarting your wait time.If a computer or voice/touch menu is the gatekeeper when you call in, you can hit the #, *, or even the 0 key to bump you out of the system. This allows you to avoid talking to a machine and allowing a human to point you in the right direction. Sometimes that person can solve the issue, but other times you get a general operator that simply shuffles you to the next location.
How to decrease hold time for customer service calls?
Log in first.You're writing about a bank, so if you're already a client you should have an access code and numeric password (PIN) to log in into their phone system. If you chose an option to log in first and THEN select "talk to our consultant" you're put into high-priority queue for clients, because they're sure it's a client calling. If you dial the number and try to reach a human right away, you're often put into low-priority queue, because they don't know who you are, so they assume you're nobody. If all consultants are occupied with clients, it may happen that low-priority queue won't get any service at all.Plus, it's also beneficial for the whole process, as your identity is already confirmed so both you and a consultant can proceed solving your issue without wasting time for identity confirmation.

Wooden bicycle pedals can be found for sale, or you can convert old pedals with new wooden blocks either replacing the plastic or overlaying it.One advantage of wood is that eventually it will wear and conform to your feet and your cycling style, so ultimately will become very comfortable while providing significant traction between your feet and the crank.  it is very durable, and is fine exposed to the elements, and it won't get hot like a lot of black plastic pedals do.Vintage pedals were made for shoe-less cycling, so it may be that simply finding old pedals will solve your problem.(image source: https://www.etsy.com/listing/183073286/wooden-bicycle-pedals )

How to decrease hold time for customer service calls?
One thing you can try — but with no guarantee of success, it depends on the company and of the luck of the draw — is to call their commercial line rather than their support line. That is, call someone whose job it is to sell you something, rather than someone whose job it is to fix something. It can be a line for new customers or for existing customers who want to buy additional services. Sales lines are generally well-staffed, because sales is considered a revenue center, unlike support which is a cost center and therefore pretty much always underfunded. Companies hate losing a sale, so they arrange for their salespeople to be easy to reach; support, on the other hand, generally means trouble for the company, so if you hang up in disgust, it saves the company trouble. Another advantage of reaching a salesperson is that their job is to keep you happy, unlike support people whose job it is to get rid of you.Never let on that you're trying to bypass the support queue. Just say that this is the number you found and you wanted something, and slowly disclose what it was that you wanted.Some salespeople will quickly detect that you aren't going to earn them a commission and will bounce you to the support queue. If that happens, you've only wasted a minute. Don't fail to mention your unhappiness with the current service though. Hint that you might be leaving for a competitor. But you can be lucky and reach a salesperson who can get you directly to level-2 support, saving you a good deal of waiting.Will this train the company to be less cavalier with support? Maybe, maybe not. Don't expect miracles. If they get their sales line bogged down with support calls, they'll have to do something about it. But companies can be slow to detect such problems, especially large ones where departments don't talk to each other. Still, in doing this, you'll make the sales department realize that they have a support problem and they can't skimp on it too much and remain competitive.
How do I make my smartphone battery last longer?
It is a fact of life with current battery technologies that the useful lifetime of a battery is usually less than the useful lifetime of the device it was sold in. If you always buy the latest and greatest and replace your phone every year, you won't notice it. If you get second-hand phones, or change it once per decade, you're likely to need to replace the battery. Three years is a typical timeframe for a smartphone battery to show serious signs of wear.On an iPhone, replacing the battery is difficult, but not impossible. (Why? Because covers that can open are considered ugly. That this incites you to buy a new phone for $600 rather than replace a battery for $30 is a side benefit.) For the iPhone 5 specifically, Apple has a replacement program, but that's only for a specific series where the battery suddenly gets worse. In general, Apple won't help you. iPhones are popular models, and you can find tutorials online — Ifixit is a good one. There's even a $25 specialized tool for that.Alternatively, if you really don't want to open your phone, use an external battery pack. For $20–$100 and 100g–300g you can get an external battery pack that's about the same capacity as the internal one or several times that.
How to clean eyeglasses if no cleaning cloth or cleaning spray is available?
This may or may not work for you, but I came up with using a drier sheet and wiping the lens slowly. It works with the outside of your lens and inside. Hope it helped!
How to decrease hold time for customer service calls?
With some companies, including online retailers and my mail away pharmacy, if I say "agent," "representative," and "customer service" repeatedly, I'll reach a live person. The automated system may ask me to describe my issue; choose a department; give my account number; or any of a number of things beginning with, "I'll be happy to get you to the right department if," but repeating those words will eventually trigger a connection to someone. Even if I have reached the wrong department, when they say they'll transfer me, I ask them to stay on the line with me while they contact the correct person, rather than putting me back on hold. A number of reputable companies will do that. Also, as @Gilles suggested, if I feel it's warranted, I'll complain or ask to speak with a supervisor. On the other hand, if someone is kind and helpful, I sincerely thank them, and, if service has been exceptional, I ask to be connected to a supervisor to report how well I was treated. This sometimes results in a representative giving me a direct number if I have further issues, and it also makes me feel good to reward people who are in a difficult line of work!
How to stop fitted sheets from creeping off a mattress after sleeping on it?
Does the fitted sheet always creep out from underneath the same side or corner of the mattress? If you reverse the orientation of the fitted sheet, is it the same side of the sheet that comes out of place, rather than the same side of the mattress? If so, the elastic in that side of the sheet may have worn out. You can solve that by sewing in some new elastic.If you conclude that the problem isn't in a specific part of the sheet, it might have to do with the mattress, or the particular way you lie in it—but even so, reinforcing the elastic may be easier than replacing your mattress or sleep habits.
How to stop fitted sheets from creeping off a mattress after sleeping on it?
What you could do:Get double sided clips and use on all four corners of the sheet, then get a strap and string those clips together so the sheet is strapped on. There are actually clips made for this, but they work differently but still may work.The problem, probably:Your sheet is not made to accodomate the depth of your matress so that if fits properly. Because of this its fits on improperly and eventually falls off. Solution: Get a sheet fitted for the bed, you can do this by measuring it your self or asking someone else how to do it, probably a matress store might help. Other Solutions:Use Velcro. Sew velcro or stick it to your matress and sheets so that they are stuck together. 
How to remove Sweat stains from clothing?
You could try:Washing the clothing in  lemon juice . Soaking the clothes gives it a better effect. Soak for at least a hour. White Vinegar works, as well.Some solutions from housecleaningcentral.com:Crush 2 aspirin in 1/2 cup of hot water and then put this on the stain. Wait 2-4 hours. After that wash as normal in clothes detergent and repeat if necessary. Using dish soap and /or Baking Soda. Baking Soda works, but not that well on the older stains. Take 1/4 cup of water and mix with 1/4 cup of ammonia. Put this on the stain and sit for 1 hour. Then wash normally. The article says you can use Meat Tenderizers, but I have little experience with them.

Waking up in the morning when standard alarms fail
Find out how much sleep you really need (for most of us it is about 8 hours) and go to bed that long before you want to get up. Get into a pattern of going to sleep at the same time most days and do not vary this pattern by more than an hour or so.This sounds like an obvious sort of answer but it's the one that works for me.
How to remove Sweat stains from clothing?
Personally, I've found that antiperspirants create stains that are significantly more noticeable than those from the sweat itself.If you use antiperspirants, perhaps try switching to a deodorant instead as a preventative measure.As for the clothes, try Vanish Oxi Action (other Sodium Percarbonate based cleaners are available!). It's pretty cheap, and blitzes through most stuff.Vanish Stain Solver - Sweat Stain Removal

IDEA #3:You can also try making a cheap 5-gallon bucket Air conditioner. Check out this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxSLbpAwibg *Someone commented on why this would not be good. IDEA #2:Now that you added the fact there's no window in the room I have another idea. How about you move the computer outside of the room and just run a longer cable under the door to connect your monitor. That way, the computer won't make the room hotter. You can also use wireless keyboard/mouse or get cheap USB extension cables. All the cables you would need can be purchased for cheap online.OLD IDEA #1:You can do something like this image below. Basically, you get some ducting from a hardware store (shouldn't cost too much) and then re-route your computer's exhaust  fan to go straight out the window instead of blowing the hot air into the small room. 
How can one remove burned food from the inside of a pot?
As a home brewer I often have this problem when malt caramelizes at the bottom of the pot. I use Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), also known as lye and caustic soda. depending on the strength of the product you can get your hands on, for the one I can get, a 3% dilution in water is enough, but you should read the indications of the manufacturer anyway. simply fill with solution until it covers all of the stuff you want to remove. let it sit for a day or so and the stuff will be floating by the time you see it again. No damage to your pots, no need to scrub anything, despite what you might think it is safe to consume trace amounts of this stuff at the recommended dilution(you might want to give it a good rinse anyway). this is what food processing plants and breweries use to clean their equipment after all.Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) should only be used on food grade stainless steel, if your pot is made from aluminum you CANNOT use this, as Sodium hydroxide reacts with aluminum and pretty much dissolves it.If your are unsure if your pot is made of steel, a fridge magnet can be used to test it, if it doesn't stick to it: it's not food grade stainless steel.Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a dangerous chemical that should be used with care, always wear eye protection and gloves.

How to retain air in the tires of bicycle for long?
Tires deflating within a couple of days have a leak. If you don't ride your bike for a couple of weeks you may see some deflation but quicker than that you need to look for a leak in your tires. Remove the inner tube and spray it with soap water. Pump up the tube a little, not a lot since you don't want to burst it, and check for bubbles. Repair any holes found. Edit: also check the tire for sharp things to cause a new hole. Visually check the inside and outside of the tire. Then rub your fingers along the inside of the tire, be careful and do this slowly so you don't hurt yourself. As far as avoiding pumping your tires up after storing the bike or not riding for a long time, you can either just deal with it or take the bike for a short ride every couple of days. As a side note, I've heard storing a bike on carpet causes the deflation faster than other materials. 
4m² Room for Gaming PC - Temperature issue
If you play your games on Steam you could use their in home-streaming service Steam Link for ~50$,put your computer in another room and stream to your monitor in your box room.Steam Link doesn't produce any warmth that matters, it's as small as a hard drvie and has inputs for 3 USB-devices, LAN and W-LAN. HDMI as output.I believe Steam lets you stream non Steam games too.
How can I stop my wipers from squeaking?
Squeaky wipers (also an annoyance for me) result from:Dry surfaceDry wiper bladesWiper motor issuesSo for each one of the above, try these:A simple trick (if the problem is not #3), is to use the sprinkler to moisten the windscreen before turning on the wipers (yes, even in rain). This way the glass is completely wet before the cycle starts.Replace the blades with performance aftermarket blades (like the ones from rain-x) these tend to last longer, are quieter as well.Unfortunately here you'd have to replace the motor head or simply have it serviced as dust/dirt/leaves can gum up the mechanism, leading to squeaks simply from running the motor.
How to retain air in the tires of bicycle for long?
The loss of air pressure is due to the ambient pressure being lower than the pressure in the tires, and a path for with air can pass from inside the tube to outside the tube (commonly called a leak). There really are only two solutions:Store the bicycle (or just the wheels) in a hyperbaric chamber. You could theoretically even inflate the tires this way, though they will look deflated while the chamber is pressurized.Block the passage of air molecules from / to the tube. Also called repairing the leak.As Doug mentions, you can use soapy water on the inner tube (not the tire) to find the leak. Don't forget to check the valve stem as this is where I find most slow leaks come from. You could even check the valve stem while the wheels are still on the bike.
How to retain air in the tires of bicycle for long?
If you don’t use bicycle for a "couple of days", then you will have to refill it. Try hanging your bicycle and try nitrogen filling instead of air. Nitrogen is supposed to last longer than air (should be available in petrol pumps)
How can I stop my wipers from squeaking?
Wiper squeaking is usually caused by bad wiper blades. Check and replace them.
Discourage sand from sticking to body when at the beach
It’s a beach, full of water, there is no way a dry skin or powder is going to help.It’s always windy in the beach, wait for some time to dry yourself and you can just shake the sand off.And try some simple cloth so that it will dry fast and will be easy to get rid of the sand.
How can I stop my wipers from squeaking?
There are electronics kits that allow you to build an adjustable interval timer. Wire that into the wiper controls.I thought there were aftermarket parts specifically for this, but it looks like you'll have to adapt a general interval timer kit.
How can I stop my wipers from squeaking?
For squeaking, you can generally get away with cleaning the wiper blade itself:Gently wipe the rubber squeegee with a damp paper towel to remove any loose dirt or oil. SourceKeeping your windshield as clean as possible will help as well. However, you will eventually need to buy new wiper blades.
How to retain air in the tires of bicycle for long?
When a tire deflates, it is because the air is escaping. Since air pressure in the tire is much higher than atmospheric (2 - 8 bar vs 1 bar for atmospheric) it is unlikely that changes in the weather / barometric pressure play a role. Similarly, temperature can play a minor role, but it would be on the order of a few % at most (pressure being lower on a really cold day).There are three main paths for air to escape:the valve. Depending on the type of valve you have, it may be possible that you can replace (parts of) it - but it's hardly ever worth ita small puncture. If you drove over a sharp object you might have a tiny hole in your tire - but realistically even very small holes would cause the tire to deflate in a matter of hours, not daysthe rubber of the tire. This is where I put my money. Rubber in general is slightly porous - that is, air can "sneak out". Different kinds of rubber have greater or lesser porosity - some butyl rubbers are particularly hermetic, some natural rubbers quite porous. As a tire ages, it can become more porous.You could take the tube out, inflate it in a bucket of water with a few drops of soap. Wait a little while - see where bubbles appear. My bet is "all over the tube". That would point to case #3, in which case the only remedy I know is to buy new tubes.
How do I make breakfast when I don't have time to make breakfast?
Learning how to cook and cook quickly is probably too broad a question, so let me suggest some things that count as "hacks"make extra dinner, keep it in the fridge, and warm it up for breakfast. Not all evening meals make a valid breakfast (or reheat well) but many do. prepare something in the evening that is ok for breakfast that you can just reheat in the morning. Perhaps make a lot of it on the weekend and freeze it.stock your home with  things that you can prepare super quickly. Instant oatmeal, frozen sausage patties, bagels, cream cheese, frozen waffles or pancakes, yogurt, granola, whatever it is you likekeep something in your car, bike bag, backpack, briefcase, or desk that you can eat for breakfast if you somehow leave the house without eating. A protein bar, for exampleYou don't have to eat official breakfast food at breakfast. Eat what works for you. 
How can I stop my wipers from squeaking?
You can also wax your windshield, this normally stops squeaks.  Replace your windshield wipers.
How can I stop my wipers from squeaking?
There are aftermarket products, like Rain-X, that you apply to the windshield which are meant to improve visibility, but also have a great side effect - they eliminate squeaking wiper blades.  This is not their intended or designed use, but they should solve the problem you are having in two ways:by making the water bead up, you won't have to run the wipers at all in light rainby coating the windshield with, essentially, a wax the wipers will glide across it without squeaking regardless of the wiper's conditionYou will have to re-apply them according to your level of usage and their instructions occasionally, but they are easy and quick to apply, and cost less than new wipers.Beyond that, you're looking at typical solutions - replacing the wipers, cleaning your windshield more thoroughly, using the washer fluid to add liquid to reduce squeaking, changing to a different washer fluid that suits your wipers better, and conditioning your wipers (the rubber breaks down in sunlight over time, leading to harder windshield wipers that are more likely to create noise).

Put it in the top rack of the dishwasher.  You can rubber band the bill around a suitable glass or bowl to retian its shape.  In fact, they even sell plastic molds for hats specifically for this.
How can I stop my wipers from squeaking?
The squeaking is caused by two major factors:Hardening of the silicone, graphite, or rubber wiper blade.Dirt on the blade, or less commonly on the windshield.If cleaning the windshield and wiper blade does not resolve the squeaking, then buy new blades. The hardened rubber will be ineffective at removing mud and leaves from the windshield, and in severe instances may become brittle and crack. When the rubber cracks it may expose the end of the wiper arm to the windshield, which leaves a characteristic bow-shaped scratch in the windshield.Windshield wipers are an inexpensive safety feature of the vehicle. Maintain them properly.
How do I make breakfast when I don't have time to make breakfast?
I'm sure you can manage lunch and dinner by buying a sandwich and a ready meal for the evening.As for breakfast, eat proper oats - buy whole rolled jumbo oats. When you get up and put the kettle on (assuming you have tea or coffee before leaving) throw a couple of tablespoons of oats in a dessert bowl or dish. When the water boils, pour over the oats so you can see a layer of water on top. Now go away and do whatever you do to get ready for work (shower, shave...etc). Check the oats - if the dish is cold, cool or warm (not hot) sprinkle over whatever you fancy - sugar, honey, berries, or nothing, then eat it. Much healthier than easy oats or instant oats, and much nicer too....
How to decrease hold time for customer service calls?
I'm willing to bet you don't hate queueing on the phone more than I do.Any trick for advancing you to the head of the queue doesn't do anything to encourage the company to improve their Customer service - it just means someone else has to wait longer. My method makes MORE work for the company so they do at least have an incentive to improve.I can't pretend I always do this but I've done it a number of times. If you don't get someone owning your problem within, say, 10 minutes, hangup and write them a letter. Include all the information they need to fix the problem. Stress that you had to resort to mail because they would not deal with your problem on the phone. Give them your phone number. Tell them you will be cancelling your direct debit on x date if they do not contact you. Obviously you don't have a DD to the bank but whatever financial penalty you can impose on them - maybe move your account elsewhere. This usually prompts some action. Send the letter recorded.When they finally deal with your complaint they may threaten to come after you for their losses (if any) but they won't - they'll lose if they try because you have it in writing that you had to resort to writing a letter due to their appalling service.Indeed, I often state in my complaint letter(s) that I will be charging them for my time at some rate per hour for every hour I have to help them solve their problem.I don't think you have this in the US but in the UK we have a concept called Small Claims Court (EDIT: just seen on another SE site that the US DOES have a small claims system). An individual can lodge a claim against ANYONE for a financial loss. I have used it a couple of times and I've threatened companies with it too. They will definitely bend over backwards to solve your problem rather than get involved in a court case, it costs you virtually nothing so there's no real loss if it all goes wrong for you.If the company don't solve the problem within a reasonable time, file a claim against them for your losses and your time.Another answerer here has suggested that poor service is the price we have to pay for cheap services. Wrong. The organisation has chosen to pitch their services cheaper than the competition to gain business. If they can't afford to  provide the service they have taken on, they should do their sums properly just like we have to when we decide if we can afford to buy a new car or new house. In the meantime, they should bite the bullet and provide the service they have voluntarily entered into a contract to supply - even if it means making a loss to do so.
Keeping tub and shower clean, mildew-free
No, you will always have to clean your bathroom regularly with proper cleaners (that's why they exist), but you can reduce the needed frequency by using the water to rinse off obvious scum (dirt, soap, etc.) after use. Or you could just quickly wipe it down with cleaners every day. Boom! Life hack!I am also wondering how others use their shower curtains: do you keep it in/over the tub at all times (including baths) or only for showers?Keep it where it is the most useful. You can determine where it is the most useful by taking a moment to visualize where the water may go, using your imagination to fill in the effect of certain laws of physics, such as gravity. Alternatively, you can do an experiment using a real shower and a shower curtain.In showers you keep part on the inside, otherwise, as you can see, water runs on the bathroom floor. In baths unless you're splashing all over the place it just gets in the way on the inside. Generally two shower curtains are used: a plastic mildew resistant one for the inside, and a cloth nicer looking one for the outside. That's why both of these types of shower curtains are sold together in stores.
How do I make breakfast when I don't have time to make breakfast?
While I'm not a big fan of hurrying meals which not only means a considerable loss of quality of life but is also unhealthy (you could really just get up 15 minutes earlier, you know!), if you truly don't have enough time in the morning, you need to apply the same strategy as in many technical fields: work asynchronously.That is, put eggs into the egg boiler, and set the electric kettle (and maybe the toaster) on before going into the shower. If you don't shower in the morning, make that "before you shave" or any other daily "biological morning activity".The eggs will still take their 6 minutes, but the latency is hidden by the fact that you do something else in the mean time. Water will have boiled and only needs another 5 seconds to boil again when you come out of the shower.  The individual times for each procedure do not add up, and thus the overall duration is reduced.Boiled eggs make a marvelous haste breakfast, too, since you can (although, again, I recommend against it) peel them in about 3 seconds by rolling them if you have some practice, and you can swallow them whole on your way out. Not pretty, no joy, but works for staying alive.As a bonus, choose the clothes that you will wear the evening before, and lay them on a table or over a chair, ready to dress. This will buy you some 3 minutes "for free" which you can spend on having a real meal rather than swallowing whole eggs, for enhanced quality of life.
How can I stop my wipers from squeaking?
You can try to calibrate the wiper spring tension. It's not uncommon for these springs to weaken in time, causing squeaking if the blade is allowed too much freedom to vibrate.Cable ties can be used to pull together some turns of the spring, making it exert more force.

How do I make breakfast when I don't have time to make breakfast?
To make sandwiches faster use muffin tins: Pic taken from above link and source on pic. Take sandwich toppings and put it in the muffin tin holes the night before then refrigerate. When you wake up the toppings are already cut and organized, so making sandwiches are easier and faster. Make food beforehand:Many foods do not have to be made the day of, they can be made days or a day before. Packaging dinner for breakfast or making a salad the night before can save you time. Restaurants/ caterers make food the day before.

Is there a non-mechanical solution to unclogging a sink drain?
There is a product called Zip-It that I saw at Lowes which appears to be a long strip of barbed flexible plastic.  It is meant to be pushed into the drain and then withdrawn, catching clogged material in the barbs for removal.  I bought one but haven't had to use it yet so I can't testify to its value, but it appears to be a more flexible variation on your coat hanger.  The coat hanger sounds potentially damaging. http://zipitclean.com/

How can I stop my wipers from squeaking?
To add to the good answers to the question: You can extend the lifetime of the wipers' rubber by wiping it down with that "magical restorer" stuff you can buy in any auto-parts store.  ArmorAll is one trade name.  And the stuff you use to restore rubber rollers (like on printers) would also work.  Do a search for "rubber restorer."  Anyway, whenever you wash your car, wipe down the rubber of the wipers with that stuff.  You should be using something like that regularly anyway, on the sidewalls of your tires (to prevent dry rot), and on your dashboard plastic and interior vinyl (to prevent cracking).  So you should make sure you have some on hand if you don't already.  After you have it, this is a lifehack. ;-)If the rubber is already dried out and cracking, then: new wiper blades.  No lifehack restores "dead" rubber, AFAIK.

How to protect my belongings at the beach
Some ways are:Put it in a fannypack, this way it is always with you. You can even swim with if you put the phone in a plastic bag. Clear Plastic bags make it so you that you can still use the phone in the bag. Use a empty clip on water bottle. This water bottle can connect to your clothes and is waterproof. Wear your possesions. Lanyards for your keys, ankle or wrist pouches for your money and clip on cases for your phone. I usually opt for a case that slides in a belt loop and clips on for added protection. Other methods that are common on the internet:Put the stuff in a diaper and ball it up. People may think it is dirty. If you are feeling mean you can even color it brown and fill it with brown clay. They may throw it away it they are a do-gooder so watch it closely. Put the stuff in a container that no one will suspect. Like ice cream cartons, milk cartons, deodorant jars, etc. Deodarant cartons can even fit in your pocket. Picture Link.
How to stop fitted sheets from creeping off a mattress after sleeping on it?
Safety pins, invented by Walter Hunt in 1849, are one of many tools that exist for attaching soft things to other soft things without slipping or doing significant damage. Since you also desire to attach a soft thing to another soft thing, these could work for you.When placing the pins either orient them along the lines of force with the hooks at the bottom to reduce bends, or orient them perpendicular to the force to prevent tears and somewhat reduce bends, or if your sheets are very fragile double it up with some scrap cloth, or pin through the hem, etc. you get the point (I hope). There are also nappy pins. Feel free to double them up, too - the sky's the limit. In general, remember that stuff happens, imagine it happening, then look at what you've done and judge it and you should be fine.You could opt for a more "hack"-like or difficult solution, but it likely won't be as good or convenient a solution as using the right tool for the job.
How to decrease hold time for customer service calls?
The best thing you can do is find something else interesting to do while you wait on hold. Perhaps go outside and enjoy the weather with a cup of tea, or read the paper while you wait to pass the time, or get some work done. At the end of the day, if you stay productive while on hold, then it's effectively the same as you never having been on hold at all. Wait to call them until it is convenient for you. If you are, for example, about to enter an important business meeting in 5 minutes, don't call them. If you are about to hop in the shower in the morning, then call them and leave the speaker phone on hold in the bathroom or something. Voila, no time lost.That said, if you're speaking about being on hold before you speak to anybody at all then there's not much you can do aside from using a different support option if available (such as email or chat).Any trick you use (like pressing 0 a lot to try to inappropriately bother an operator) to shorten your wait lengthens somebody else's (potentially causing them to find your question on Lifehacks while searching for a solution). Your service issue is of equal urgency and importance as all the other callers you are waiting for. Also remember that "large companies" employ real people just like you, with human limitations who wake up and go to work answering phone calls every day.Successful large companies already know what matters for their bottom lines in the long run, a single or small handful of customer complaints will never be an incentive. If it's truly a problem then they'll naturally build up a bad reputation without you having to take active steps, and even then only if the bad service reputation is affecting their profit margins will they invest in customer support improvements. Sometimes you simply have to accept that for certain companies, poor customer service isn't hurting them, even if it irritates customers sometimes.
How can I stop my wipers from squeaking?
This might sound bizarre, but in the past 8 years I've only replace wipers twice, I stick with the OEM ones and when they start to squeek I remove and wash with a sponge, and warm soapy water then put them back on the car. I also regularly fully clean the windscreen with car glass cleaner.

(6 g) or more of salt to a gallon (3,78 l) of boiled water before making ice. Salt changes the freezing temperature of ice. It will freeze and melt more slowly.use as big ice cube trays as possible (muffin tins as alternative). The bigger the ice block the slower it meltsSource:WikiHow
How to make Ice melt slower?
A simple solution is more ice with less surface area. The less surface exposed surface area, the slower the ice will melt. Ideally, use a single ice ball (sphere) instead of multiple small ice cubes.
How can one remove burned food from the inside of a pot?
You know how hey say "like dissolves like" when talking about solubility? So what I usually do is I use the same substance that got stuck on the pot. In your case you could leave the pot soaking in milk overnight, then bring it to a boil stirring it so it doesn't burn, then discard and scrub. This has worked for me in the past with food on the greasier side.You could also use a mix of milk and soap, that has worked for me as well.
What is the easiest way to "finish off" small residual balances from a prepaid debit card?
Go to 7-11 and buy something that costs more.   Give them cash for the difference.You will need to figure out exactly how much is left on the card.  So if it's 1.87 and you buy something that is 2.00 .  you give the clerk 13 cents and tell him you want to put the rest on your card.  Problem solved. Also, if you have more than $5, you can get cash back from 7-11 when you make a purchase.  Sometimes I buy a 25 cent candy just to get 5 or 10 bucks off my card.
How to easily clean dough remains after baking bread?
What I do is:After kneeding the bread and setting it in a bowl, rub your hands together over that same bowl or a different bowl . This makes all the bread dough just flake off. Leaving your hands cleaner. Take a spatula that is dry and just scrape with it. The dough will come up better if you get the bulk up without water. After scraping the bulk you can scrub it down before it dries, as dried dough is harder to clean. To prevent it:I have learned that if you use a little flour when kneeding this takes most of the stickiness away. Instead of that you could grease your hands with cooking oil, this works to make the bread not stick to your hands. Oil works better as flour can wear off faster. Wearing gloves. This way you can't feel the dough, but your hands stay clean. Put the dough in a plastic bag and knead through their. The bigger and clearer the bag the better. This works perfectly for me, if I want to cook while I am dressed up. My clothes and hands stay clean, plus it is a plus that you have less to wash later. 
Remove white stain from counter top
It depends on how deep the burn is and what material the worktop is.   Looking at the image it's not too badly burned. A good test is to wet the burned area with water. If the mark disappears then it's likely easily repairable, otherwise it might require a more substantial approach.  Not 100% clear from the image, but it seems to be a basic kitchen worktop - laminated/veneered chipboard/particleboard.If this is the case, then you can try some of the following ideas:  PrepClean the surface with a clean damp cloth (water only) to remove dust/debris. Any debris there can score the area badly when using the following methods to fix the burn mark.   This stage can show you whether the stain disappears when wet.  Buff/Polish with Cleaner approachAbrasive cleaners or other substances such as toothpaste and bicarbonate of soda can "re-polish" the surface if it's only lightly marked.This would likely require some lacquer to have remained underneath the burn to be able to polish it up. The water test can be a good indication of whether it can be polished up or not (though not all circumstances are equal so evaluation and slow test is key here). Don't use too strong an abrasive cleaner, use a soft damp cloth, and press gently.   You are trying to polish the lacquer/glaze, not scrub away the burnmarkApply a very small amount of the substance (such as Cif (or similar), or toothpaste and bicarb together) to only a small part of the burned area. Very gently rub the marked area with a soft damp cloth. Rinse off with clean water, pat dry, and wait for it to fully dry (20 mins ish) and see what it looks like.  Analyse the results, and if you are happy it's an improvement, repeat across the rest of the marked area.Don't suddenly get excited though, keep it simple and only apply a little substance and soft cloth, and only do it for a short time. Rinse with clean water and leave to dry again.  Just because one small area has come back up doesn't mean it all will, so keep "test" and "small progress" in mind.This won't likely be done and dusted in 10 mins, and if you want the problem to be resolved, put aside some hours.Good thing is you don't need to stay with it. After rinse, go and do whatever else for 20 mins or more, then come back, even the next day if needed.  Don't go too far!  If positive results are happening keep it slow and simple, wipingclean and leaving to fully dry for further inspection, until thestain is removed. While you are polishing up the lacquer under theburn mark, going too far means you risk removing any renaminglacquer, then there is nothing to "polish"Iron and tea towelThis method usually works better with varnished or other types of finished surfaces, but it may work.  You do need to take this one slowly as this can also make the problem worse or increase the size of the burn mark.  Take a clean, dry tea towel and place it over the burn mark.  Get an electric clothes iron, and with steam setting OFF, gently press on the tea towel where the burn mark is. Don't leave the iron on, gently press down for a second and then back up. Do this a few times and remove the tea towel and check for results.If there's no additional damage, or nothing has changed, or improvements are being made, repeat again slowly and for only a short time.  How long you do this for etc depends on how deep the stain is, and what material the surface is.  If after doing this for a while you feel there are no results, you can try turning the steam setting ON. However, be careful here as this can also cause burn damage!This method really does need a very slow approach and only apply the iron with steam very briefly and check the surface for results.  DisclaimersWARNING: The above advice is only advice, and care is to be taken to evaluate the intensity of the damage and the work surface before trying the above methods.Using the wrong method or substance may very easily make the burn mark worse!Even some laminates can have varying lacquer thickness. So there's no one rule fits all, you just have to be careful and go slowly.Never place a hot iron directly on or above the work surface (without tea towel etc). It will possibly cause damage.  You are not likely to make the overall problem worse given there is already damage, but you can increase the size or intensity of the damage if you go to hard with one of the methods, and then another method which may have worked, might no longer due to increased damages.  Just go steady :)  OtherYou can buy repair kits, which usually consist of paint and lacquer, but they're not cheap and often not cheaper than fitting a new worktop.Cost comparison depends on the worktop (is it a cheapy one etc) and how much of the worksurface you need to replace (i.e. is it a small piece near a join etc).  Painting worksurfaces is also usually  done when you want to change the entire colour. However, if done correctly, you can get some amazing results.  For example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4282m_LbrUObviously if you are avoiding costs for repairs you won't want to do something like this, but it is a viable option with amazing results.

How to glue wood pieces together nicely without clamps?
If you want a good looking finished product, nothing will compare to using the correct tools for the job. That being said you could tie string around the boards and do a tourniquet type thing to tighten them good. Wrap a string around the board, tie a knot at the two ends, close to having the string tight, but not too close. Stick a stick at the knot and twist the stick till the rope is tight. You'll also need to have something heavy across the boards to keep them all flat. Warning: this will work but will require significant sanding/planing to have a good finished product and having the right clamps for the job will save significant time.

How can I open the window when it's dark outside without fearing that moths might fly in?
Well, if darkening your screen is not a option:Take a cloth and pin that up in window. This can be achieved with tacks, tape or etc. This is not a hack, but investing in other cooling options would be wise. Having a fan facing the window also helps. As this gives the insects something to fly against and makes it harder for them to enter. 
How can I open the window when it's dark outside without fearing that moths might fly in?
This isn't a hack answer, but I've got the same problem, I hate them in the house. I never open a window at night when the lights are on unless its one of the windows covered either in net curtain (which prevents most of them getting in, not necessarily all, depends how bright the light is in the room) or an insect screen. Both of which you'd have to buy...
How can I open the window when it's dark outside without fearing that moths might fly in?
Light temperature makes a huge difference. If you are using compact fluorescent lamps, make sure you are using those with "yellow light" (2700 Kelvin).In the case of incandescente lamp, you  can use a 220V lamp on a 127V instalation the light will attract way less insects (moth included).This will not prevent any moths but will reduce a lot their presence.

I've had success in tricking flies into leaving a room by turning on a light in the hallway. You may be able to distract (a percentage of) the moths by installing a more moth-attractive light somewhere outside.
How to keep tobacco moist?
thick cut potato skins work very well, as they don't leave behind any scent or taste that could contaminate your tobacco being a quite neutral earthy vegetable, and can keep it moist for up 3-4 days.further to @ adems answer I have also sprayed my tobacco to rejuvenate it before now, but id spread it out and use something that mists rather than sprays as I have also ruined a pouch this way (you could dry it out again but it becomes very weak tasting)  hope this helps 
How to improvise a dust pan and brush?
Really would depend for me.If it is small particles (like dust or glitter), I would use Scotch or box tape to pick.If it was not sharp, I would use my hand and sweep onto a manila envelope or a folder.If it is sharp, I would go get a dustpan and broom. Safety first. If that is simply not possible, a book or a magazine with the spine side in your hand; the pages can act like a brush for you to sweep onto a folder.
How to easily clean dough remains after baking bread?
Get a flour container and a scale. Getting flour from a container is less messy than getting it from a bag, and measuring with a scale means you don't need to sift or level, which I've never managed to do cleanly.Add a small amount of oil to the dough. I usually add a quarter cup of canola oil for roughly 7 cups of flour. One of the benefits is that it makes the dough less sticky, so there's less of a mess in the bowl. All the recipes I've seen that have both a sponge and oil have you add the oil after the sponge, but I have no idea if this is really that important or not.Use gloves while kneading the dough. Rubber cleaning gloves keep your hands from getting messy when you knead, and you can scrub off the dough with scalding-hot water. If you don't care so much about reusability, disposable gloves from a pharmacy are pretty great. You can knead and then toss out the gloves.Knead in the bowl. I do it this way and I still get really good bread. Plus you don't have to use a kneading surface or worry about creating more mess in a transfer.After baking, leave the bowl out overnight. All of the remaining dough will dry out and you can scrape it off into the garbage can.
How to improvise a dust pan and brush?
I don't know about the brush, but a piece of paper with one edge wetted with water can do a superior job when brushing up fine powders, because a dust pan will leave a stripe of dust.
Remove white stain from counter top
In the spirit of "life hack":  Heat the rest of the counter until it is all the same color.
How to improvise a dust pan and brush?
A piece of paper or card stock works well as the pan, and a magazine held by the spine, or a bunch of loose papers held together at one end, should work for the brush.  
Makeshift cooler after buying icecream or beverages at the beach
The non-hack way is cooler bags. These are bags that are like coolers only they are bags, they can be disguised in boxes or other bags or even buy one that you like. They come in many styles. As a extra these can be folded up so they are small or used like a regular bag to carry other items. Take a container fill it with bags of ice and then place  another container within it. Place your goods in this container and you should be ready to go. Keep this in the shade and wrap in a non-absorbing blanket. This may need the ice refilled every couple of hours. This probably would not work for transporting it. You could place all items in a regular plastic bag and then cover it with a jacket. This way it is protected from sunlight and some heat. 
How can I open the window when it's dark outside without fearing that moths might fly in?
During a camping trip, I had seen the camp guy place a pan/plate filled with water, right under a light.Being the only light source in the room, the moths came in and many got tricked and dived into the water. But a window net screen is best solution 
How to protect my belongings at the beach
Definitively not fool-proof, but if you are at a beach with sand, you could bury the stuff in the sand under your blanket or similar. When it is out of sight, it is not that easy to steal, and then the burglar actually have to see you bury it and they have to dig it out of the sand.In general I would usually go for carrying the most valuable stuff on me. Or possibly hide it away in the car, and carry only the car key.
Makeshift cooler after buying icecream or beverages at the beach
Wrap them in a wet towel and you have an evaporative cooler.
Makeshift cooler after buying icecream or beverages at the beach
Cooler bag is the obvious choice, but not cool enough for you, apparently (sorry, I just like the play on words)! Best take a large newspaper or several newspapers/magazines to read. Wrap your ice creams in those and they'll be insulated on the trip back. Bit more difficult to wrap it round canned drinks though.
Makeshift cooler after buying icecream or beverages at the beach
I would definitely use as many towels as possible, as per @Peter Crotty's answer - but I wouldn't wet them. Water is a much better conductor than air. Wrapping them with as much material as possible is the key, preferably light coloured on the outside to reflect as much light/heat as possible.We tend to think that insulating things makes them warm but it helps to think of it as keeping them the same.A suggestion: you could take 2 towels, fold the darkest one into 2 or 3 and wrap the goodies, then drop that bundle into the centre of the lighter towel, gather the corners into a "bag" that you can hold with one hand. As you walk, keep the "bag" in the shade of your body as best you can - but try to stop it contacting your body because, at 37 degrees, you are probably the worst enemy. The bag will mean you can hold the payload without the need to hug it to your chest.EDIT: Another important thing I've just thought of.... You don't want the towels to be warm before you wrap the ice creams in them. If they are warm at the start (likely) then you need to allow them to cool in the air as you walk to the shop - but without letting the sun warm them! You'll have to figure that out for yourself. If they are not too warm then wrap the darker one in the lighter one to keep it the coolest.
Friendly way to get rid of screeching birds
Quoting from this page:Birds are very sensitive to their environment during the breeding season. In particular, you take a big risk when you move a nest, even if you move it a short distance. The bird may abandon the nest and anything in it. Additionally, it is illegal to disturb the nests of birds protected under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act.Doesn't sound like there's anything you can do until the young are gone.
Friendly way to get rid of screeching birds
Get a plastic raven and place it somewhere they can see it. It will frighten them off. If the thought of the little birds starving bothers you, wait till the chicks have flown the nest, and prevent the next brood from starting.I got a plastic raven to scare off sparrows from nesting in my gutter. You have to place it so it's visible from above, and you have to move it occasionally.
How to remove facial hairs in girls without threading/bleaching using natural products?
If the hair is really thick then I would say consult a doctor, as this may signal a more important problem. If the hair is just a few then I would say leave them, as removing them may encourage more to grow.  However, I can think of only 2 really good solutions: Pluck the hair out. Some people may think this is to time consuming, but if you have a couple of hairs this will be fast. There is some pain, but doing it fast will lessen pain. Placing a warm towel over your face before, also makes it feels better. Wax your face. This is painful, waxing any part of your body is painful. But it shouldn't be to bad or to long. There are even ways to do it at home naturally. Link.Alternate ways are:From this link:Mix turmeric and water equally and apply it to the lip. Apply it for about 30 minutes and let it harden. Do this for awhile, 4 weeks, and the hair should not have grown anymore.Using depilatory pastes may burn and shaving will make it come back like a forest.   
How to protect my belongings at the beach
Stuff them into your shoes when you take your shoes off. Put them in first, then your socks so it looks like only your socks are sticking out. If you are wearing sandals, might be worth it to bring an extra ratty pair of shoes to stuff into. Very common sight at the beach, but no one will steal an old pair of shoes.
How to dry out a wet phone?
There are reports of being electrocuted by a phone, but I don't know the viability of this idea. Below is what I have done on multiple occasions:Turn off the phone and take the battery out. Put the phone in a bowl of rice after drying all the water you can off. Leave the phone off for a day or 2. Note: If the phone is damaged, I.e. won't turn on, buckling somehow, etc. You may have to take it to the phone shop to see if they can do anything. There are waterproof cases to help avoid this. A plastic sand which bag makes a lovely waterproof case for cheap. As well, I have never heard of the recovery of a phone that has been underwater that long. Asking them what parts are damaged could be a great place to start, maybe you can replace them yourself. Some sources say that rice does not work, but putting a rag over a vacuum cleaner and sibling the water out can help. Use rice as a extra precaution. Never use hair dryers and never lie to the phone store about there being water in the phone. They can tell by indicators and the heat dan harm the phone. 
How to dry out a wet phone?
In case the phone fell into water there is a high risk of short circuits due to the electrical conductivity of water. This does not only cause damage to the parts but can also lead to an overheating of the battery. Therefore the first  action we should take is toImmediately remove the batteryDo not try to operate the device. It will make things worse for sure.Remove all waterAfter having removed the battery we have to get rid of all the water in the device.Remove all parts (SIM card, memory cards, headsets)Open the case and dismantle as many parts as you can but try to remember to be able to get them back together again. You may need to use a fine screw driver for this. Keep the screws in a safe place and note down where they go.Remove gross water drops with a dry towel or handkerchief.Patiently let the device dry at room temperature for several days (time needed depends much on the environmental humidity where you live).Remove salt or sugarIn case it fell into salt water, soup or beverage we have to remove salt or sugar too to avoid later corrosion or short circuits. This can be done by immersing all parts except the battery in a bath of distilled water.Accelerate the drying processThere are several ways to accelerate the drying process. Use any but do not use the sun, an oven or a hair dryer - the heat may damage your device.Put all parts in an air tight bag with a water absorbing substance for some days (at least 2). This could be rice or silica gel bags (which come in the packages of many electronic devices) but do not use salt because of its corrosive potential.Immerse all parts (except the battery) in isopropyl alcohol. This will solve all remaining water and it then evaporates much faster than water alone. There is a small risk however to damage non-alcohol resistant glued parts by this.Professionals use a vacuum chamber for rapid water removal but we mortals may have no access to that.What if the device still does not work?Well, then you should know that you are not alone. Only a fraction of phones will survive from being drowned. Unfortunately due to moisture detectors within the devices your warranty will be void in any case.Sadly from newer devices the battery can no longer be removed. Therefore the chances for rescue are much smaller.
How to dry out a wet phone?
Take all the cases, backs, SIM cards, SD cards, and anything else off. Then fill a bag with uncooked rice and bury the phone in the rice. The rice will remove the moisture from the phone.
How can I remove grease from controllers?
I think this is a valid question. Been there myself with controllers and keyboards and T.V. remotes. They are electronic, and you don't want to get water into the buttons, etc. So a wet soapy rag seems to be a bad idea.What I do personally is wipe it clean with a paper towel, then I take a wash cloth, get it wet and soapy(with dish detergent), and wring it out really well BEFORE wiping my controllers. You will still have enough water and dish detergent to get the grease off, no problem. Then dry again with paper towel.Good luck!
Air Conditioner/Coolers best substitute
A spray bottle of water.   (Ignore these additional nonsense characters added 'cause site doesn't like short answers.)
Air Conditioner/Coolers best substitute
Most people won't have the materials to do this, but you can mimic a swamp cooler. You need flowing cold water for best effect, but static water or ice is better than nothing. If you have some sort of fountain you will place a fan right in front of that blowing on you. If too much water is getting on the fan you can put an air filter in front of the fountain and behind the fan, the type you should have in a furnace or ac unit. They are cheap, like $1 each, if you don't have one and need one. You could make your own swap cooler by making a recycling water fountain to soak one of those filters. Another filter about 2 inches away from that one that isn't getting soaked, and then a fan directly touching the dry filter blowing away from the water. You'll have to look up making a fountain though as I don't have any real experience with making one. The idea is for the water to cool off the air being sucked into the fan and subsequently blown into you. The colder the water and the more water that flows over the filter the better it will work. Edit: also if you can find a filter that is more porous, or has larger holes, you will get more air flow and thus cooler air. Edit: this video here is almost exactly what I described, or at least pictured in my head. The second air filter I mentioned was just to keep the fan from being saturated from splashes and thus dying. 
Friendly way to get rid of screeching birds
Assuming it's a non-protected bird, you could scare them away with movement or sound.You stated you can't reach there, but you don't have to. A ventilator on a stick produces a lot of air movement and noise. If the distance is too big to cross with a stick, you may consider using a drone (birds don't like quadcopters).A speaker could be useful but possibly provide problems with the neighbours.
Clothespin alternatives
I do laundry while camping often and clothespegs truly are a good solution to the problem of securing laundry. That said, you have some options. First, consider using the clothes to secure themselves. For example, unbutton a pair of pants, then close the button up around the line so it hangs. It won't dry as fast as if it was pegged out, but it will be faster than if it was lying on the ground after falling off. Wrap a shirt around the line horizontally - neck end to your left, say and waist end to your right - then do up the buttons to hold the shirt on. Or undo one end of the line and put it through a sleeve, and out the neck, or through a sleeve, across the body of the shirt and out the other sleeve (works for Tshirts as well as button shirts.) These things won't help you with your "smalls" but might let you conserve a limited number of pegs to use for those things that really need them.Or, you can buy a pegless washing line. This is made of two or more stretchy lines wound together. You pull the two apart a bit to stick a corner of a towel or clothing item through the hole, and when you let go, the elastic holds on to the item.Many (but not all) are marked Indoor, but you could try them outside. There are also pegless lines made of plastic clips that are marked outdoor.I found an elastic version on Amazon for less than $3, though you might need more than one to get enough length for a full load of washing.
How to get air tight seals on canisters?
Try to find a rubber O-ring that fits the diameter of the lid. Then just slide it on the lip of the lid, on the area that fits inside the can. Then push down. That should seal it.
Organizing spices in my kitchen cupboard?
I don't know if you buy ice cream in plastic boxes - I used to, the boxes they came in were about 6 inches long by about 4 inches wide, and 3 inches deep. I kept those - each one is filled with spices and herbs, and I stack one on top of another, on top of the caps on the jars in the one below. It does mean you have to lift off the top box to get whatever you need in the one housed below, but that's a lot easier than moving several individual jars of herbs balanced on one another. Any suitable box from any product you buy could be used, I just happened to have lots of ice cream containers. You may decide you need prettier boxes though, if they're on display, mine are inside a cupboard, but really, herbs and spices should be kept in the dark, in a closed cupboard, not permanently exposed to daylight, unless the containers aren't clear.
How do I clean dust between my desk and glass protecting it?
If the glass is up off the wood at all, sometimes there are small rubber bumpers around the edges to keep it off the wood, then get compressed air and blow between the glass and wood. You could try it even if it isn't raised up as it might still have a small gap to let you blow it out.

How to dry out the gasket on my washing machine between washes?
For some washers, rather than drying the gasket to prevent mold, periodic use of a self-cleaning cycle is recommended.ConsumerReports.org article How to prevent smelly mold buildup in front-loading washers recommends the following:Wipe the door gasket and glass dry once you're done.Clean the detergent dispenser and any attachments once or twice a month.Run a dehumidifier if your laundry room is damp.Keep the washer door ajar between loads to allow air to circulate. If you have small children, keep the laundry-room door locked.It also suggests documenting any issue and contacting the manufacturer.
How do I clean dust between my desk and glass protecting it?
Here is what I do,take a piece of cloth,take a spoon, the cloth covers the back of the spoon,insert the back of the spoon as you are cleaning the space between the glass top and the desk.IN CASE THE AREA OF THE GLASS AND THE DESK IS TOO BIG:with the back of the spoon with very long (not big in area) cloth, use the back of the spoon in such a way that it comes off the other end, then slide it gently with the right hand and then with the left hand (in a harmonic motion) until you get the whole under glass top cleansed.
How do I clean dust between my desk and glass protecting it?
This depends on how thick the glass is. If the pane is thick enough, you can lift one end a bit and slide some shims underneath, then repeat on the other side until you have a gap big enough to clean between.But the glass needs to be really thick for this to work. As an example: I have some glass shelves in my cupboard. These are 80x30 cm and 6 mm thick, and are specified for a maximum allowable weight of 10 kg. A desktop computer with monitor is easily twice that, and the pane of glass is much larger. As a first approach, double the size = half the carrying capacity, so if your desk is 150 x 80, you'd need a glass pane several cm thick to carry your computer. This is unlikely, so you'll have to remove the computer before lifting the glass. Normally the weight of the computer isn't an issue: the entire area of the glass is supported by the desk. But if you lift the glass, it's supported only by the edges.  
Organizing spices in my kitchen cupboard?
Get it out of your cupboard and onto your refrigerator. My fiance had bought me a pre-made set of magnetic spice holders and they are great; took a great deal of my spcies out of my cabinet and they are now on the fridge. Here is how you can make your own.
Using a 5v USB Wall Charger on a Zenfone 2 with +9v battery?
No. You simply cannot use a lower voltage charger in a reliable manner. The battery needs to be charged at a higher voltage than the battery holds.Too high voltage and the battery can be damaged. Too low voltage and the battery isn't getting charged. Most chargers should prevent damage in such a case, but it's possible to break your charger with this.You're not required to use the original charger, but make sure you get at least the voltage right. If the original is 9V, don't use anything different than 9V unless you know what you're doing. If the original is 12V, use 12V. Too many Ampere is irrelevant, not enough would result in a very slow charging process.
How can I straighten a slightly bent 3.5mm headphone plug?
If it ain't broken, don't fix it.3.5mm connectors are fragile. They're frequently abused. They won't last forever. Every action you perform on it may weaken the structural integrity. As Ian said in the comments, the chances of you making it worse are quite high.If you really have to fix it:Grab two thin pliers, put one one the midsection and one on the tip. Now bend, very carefully.If you break it, you'll need a soldering iron and a new connector. The connector is cheap, but it's not worth getting a soldering iron if this is the only thing you want to do with it.

How to dry out the gasket on my washing machine between washes?
I've had the same front loading washing machine, with this type of gasket, for 16 years; I have never dried the gasket when the wash is complete, just left it as it is, and never once has mould appeared anywhere on the gasket. I've never once run a self cleaning programme, most of the wash cycles I do are unheated, meaning in cold water, with one hot wash weekly or fortnightly for certain items, always using liquid detergent followed by fabric conditioner. The dispenser drawer does get mouldy and needs cleaning, but I don't see mould anywhere else. BUT, I never close the door on the washing machine when its not in use, its always left pushed to, but slightly open, and perhaps that's why, so if you've been keeping yours closed, don't.We have high humidity here most of the time, but not heat - if you live somewhere very hot and humid, I'm guessing that might encourage the problem.
Haircare for long rough male hair
Doesn't sound as if your conditioner is doing the job at all well, you may need a different one, preferably one with 'smoothing' qualities - these are usually sold with a description along the lines of 'sleek and smooth'. Maybe you're using a high detergent level shampoo too - when you choose a shampoo, smell it - those with high detergent levels can be detected by the nose and smell a bit like washing up liquid and should be avoided. This only works if you have a reasonably good sense of smell, obviously, and men often don't have (no criticism, just a fact) so maybe ask a woman to smell it for you if that's the case for you. Expensive shampoos MIGHT have less detergent, but not necessarily. Either way, pick a shampoo that's gentle (sniff those too, even shampoos for babies vary), wash the hair and when you condition, and using a wide tooth comb, comb the conditioner through and leave it on for 10 to 30 minutes, then rinse off.This next part is the only bit that might fit into the 'Hack' category, because you might have it in the kitchen cupboard already. Ordinary coconut oil is a good restorative for use on dry, rough hair, but use it on dry, not wet, hair - warm it slightly to melt it, and apply liberally to all the hair, wrap the hair round your head and then wrap in a towel or cling film, leave it on all night, wash and condition as usual the next day. You may find you need to wash it twice to clear away the oil. Repeat this treatment periodically, when you notice your hair looks dry and rough again.

Makeshift cooler after buying icecream or beverages at the beach
You could bring a chunk of dry ice in an isolated shopping bag. Don't bring dry ice flakes, get a massive block. When on the beach, wrap in as many towels as possible and make sure there is no air draft to carry away the cold air. Dig a hole and put it at the bottom, then it will form a lake of cold air around it and will last hours.

How can I remove ants from my laptop keyboard?
Usually Boric powder works when trying to get rid of ants.But using it on laptop keyboard I am not sure. But probably safer than bug sprays. (Make sure laptop is switched off and battery removed). You can bait them out by placing some sweet/sugar stuff on your laptop trackpad.And smash to kill as they come out. p.s. avoid eating or keeping food items near your laptop to avoid future infestation. 
How can I remove ants from my laptop keyboard?
To remove almost anything, the simplest and most effective way is to use an Aero Duster. These blast compressed air in under the keys and into all the nooks and crannies and will safely leave your keyboard ant-free.Of more importance is how to avoid ants deciding to colonise your laptop in the first place. You must have spilled something sweet in there at some point, so you may wish to avoid bringing food and drink anywhere near it.If it is still attractive to ants, you can always pop it apart - all laptops are fairly easy to disassemble, as long as you know where the clips and screws are - and as all laptops are different, I'd suggest looking for a youtube video showing your particular one.Additionally, when it isn't in use, put it back in a laptop bag. It will help.
How can I organize snacks effectively without them going bad?
Group by expiry date, for sure - once they're past that, you'll just be putting them in the bin, so the point, surely, is to have them in date order so you know what must be eaten first, that's the priority, regardless of the product. That's the way products are stacked on supermarket shelves, with the shortest dated produce to the front, longer at the back. Admittedly, theirs are grouped by the product, then the date, but you've got, presumably, a random selection available, so in those circumstances, the date is the consideration.As an aside, I'd also say don't buy so many snacks, that'd make life a lot easier (and healthier, probably). And don't shop when you're hungry, you'd be surprised how much easier it is to walk straight past snack type food and only buy what you need when you've got a full stomach.
How to keep tobacco moist?
Lettuce leaf inside the pouch (either leather with a zip or the plastic wallet you buy it in, keeps moist better than a tin) - will need to be replaced every 2 or 3 days, depending on its size and type of lettuce. Cos or Romaine lettuce, followed by Little Gem, is the best, because they have a thick moisture filled spine on the leaf - break the spine a bit before putting in the tobacco.I'm mystified though - I like my tobacco fairly dry, so I only resort to lettuce when the weather is very hot and the tobacco's become crispy. I've spent more time drying out my tobacco (sometimes in a warm oven) than keeping it moist over the years...but then the UK has high humidity most of the time.
How can I remove ants from my laptop keyboard?
I am from India. We have good sunlight almost year-round. If I were you, then I would simply put my laptop in the sunlight for 5-10 minutes. The ants will leave the keyboard because it will get too hot for them. Be careful with a plasma display - sunlight will harm it!
How can I remove grease from controllers?
some lemon juice will probably be all you need. any non-destructive degreaser (ethanol, citric acid, vinegar, ... ) will help you out. Just make sure your application cloth is damp, not soaked, so not to destroy any electronics inside. 
How can I remove ants from my laptop keyboard?
One way is to lure them out with something sweet and then not let them go back inside the keyboard.Another is to suck them out with a vacuum cleaner or blow them away with a vacuum cleaner on reverse. Don't forget to take out your keyboard from the notebook to avoid blowing something unwanted inside.Also you might want to try freezing them. Don't attach the keyboard back too soon after taking it out of the freezer though to avoid short circuiting due to possible condensation due to temperature difference.Extreme solution: put your notebook in a sealed container, vacuum air out and insert a deadly gas >:) One easy gas is butane from a regular lighter. Put the keyboard inside a plastic bag where you can see what's going on inside and have good control of the lighter.Suck the air out with your mouth, it should not be dangerous unless your keyboard already contains deadly gases or you tried bug poison earlier. In that case use a vacuum cleaner hose.Press the lighter button, but don't light it, obviously. Let out enough gas so that the plastic bag inflates visibly, and the proportion of the air to gas is small enough to seem deadly for the ants.Leave for a day to be sure, but in a place where kids, fire and direct sunlight can't reach it. Or it could result in a noticeable explosion. Better put the plastic bag inside a more protective container, like a jar, in case ants decide to run for their lives and eat through the plastic bag, resulting in a leak.After you're sure the ants are dead, let out the gas inside the bag in conditions that would not result in gas explosion. The ants inside are probably not holding onto anything, so you can shake them out of the keyboard and plug it back in.Simply vacuuming air out may not be effective because the ants are pretty small and who knows how long it would take for them to breathe through all the oxygen between the keys and the keyboard base. Saturating their air with a non-breathable gas should speed up the process sufficiently.
How to dry out the gasket on my washing machine between washes?
I don't ever see mold in my machine, but it does stink after awhile if I leave something wet in it on a hot day, so it could be growing mold where I do not see from time to time. What I do day to day that helps the most is take my clothes out right away, and leave the top of the machine open to dry out when I am not using it. But if it ever smells bad, I just throw a cup of vinegar in with my clothes the next time I wash. It seems to kill the smell fine. I have in the past also put a quarter cup of bleach in the machine and ran just a rinse cycle to clean it. Without any clothes of course! You could keep the lid open and let the machine fill with water, put the bleach in and let it soak until after work. Then close the lid and finish the cycle it will kill whatever is in your machine that the water can touch.The biggest problem with mold is that once you get it somewhere, if any is left after you clean will grow back very fast once everything is wet again. I got mold in a sink once, and had to take the "P" tube out and let it dry for a whole week and put it back together because it would not ever come completely clean. It is possible you have something similar going on with your machine? Mold under it, in other areas you can't see, etc...
How to dry out the gasket on my washing machine between washes?
Rather than drying the gasket out to stop mould growth you are better off killing the mould before it has a chance to grow much. You can do this by running a cycle with nothing in the machine at the hottest temperature setting. Add a small amount of laundry bleach according to the instructions on the bottle. If you do this once every month or so then you shouldn't see any mould growing in the machine.
How can I remove ants from my laptop keyboard?
Cut off their air/water/food, and they'll die. Just put your laptop in a sealed plastic bag for a couple days. A 2-gallon Ziploc freezer bag should do the trick.*This only works if you can go without a computer for that long.
How can I remove ants from my laptop keyboard?
I just read in Consumer Reports that ants hate cinnamon. Maybe a sprinkle of it would help. I have to agree with the other commenters though that making sure that you're not putting food in your keyboard is the best option. I know that you can buy plastic keyboard covers for just that purpose.
Smell bad but no deodorant
I was in your exact situation once and I put some hand sanitizer on a napkin and wiped my underarms with it. It worked great. It's not something you'd want to do everyday as I suspect the alcohol would be rough on your skin. It worked great for me in an emergency though.
How can one remove burned food from the inside of a pot?
I've had awesome results with boiling baking soda and water in the pot then letting it cool down. When you go to scrub it, everything will just slide out.
How to dust a TV screen?
Most vacuum cleaners have a brush attachment. I've used several of them directly on a TV screen and haven't noticed any ill effects on the screen. It works well because you can brush the edges and corners and the vacuum sucks up the dust rather than it going into the air.
How can I remove ants from my laptop keyboard?
There are already some good answers for how to get them out immediately. However, I have an alternate proposal: Wait until they leave on their own.They're there because there's food in there. As others have suggested, this is probably food or drink from your meals. If you let them work, they'll clean it for you by removing every trace of food. Once it's clean, they'll leave. They're not likely to build a nest in there or anything and they shouldn't be able to get down into any sensitive circuitry and get fried.Pop out the battery. Find where they're getting inside. Put the laptop next to the opening. Wait until they're done. Keep food and drink some reasonable distance away from the keyboard.This is especially effective if you've spilled a sugary drink on the keyboard. They can get rid of all the stickiness.
How to dust a TV screen?
Use a cloth designed to hold dust, such as micro-fiber. Generally, if you aren't using the right tools for the job, your results will be less than ideal. Flat cotton cloth does not hold dust well. Micro-fiber cloths are designed specifically for this.For the total package: LCD screen cleaning kits on Amazon, Newegg, Google.There are other tools designed for removing dust as well, such as feather dusters:You could "hack" it by using other various cloth and brush-like objects that do a poorer job than things actually designed for cleaning, but it would be better to use proper cleaning products.
How to clean glass without glass cleaner?
Get a bucket or container, put in warm water, a squirt of washing up liquid and a slosh of vinegar - wash the window with this, preferably using a cloth (dishcloth, old teeshirt, whatever, but not a microfibre cloth). Now get another bucket or bowl, this time with plain water and more vinegar (about 1 to 2 tablespoons to 4 pints) and rinse with that, sloshing it on with another cloth, or if you can, throwing it over the glass (depends where the glass is, if its outdoors, throw it on to rinse off the soapy stuff). If you've got a squeegee, wipe off the rinse water with that, or let it drain down naturally - letting it drain naturally doesn't leave smears, but anything that doesn't run off in terms of water droplets might leave a mark. Doesn't matter what kind of vinegar, so long as its real vinegar.
How can I warm up a bathroom without a heater?
Without a heater, you're not going to be able to really warm up the bathroom.But there are a few hacks to mitigate your problem:  Use a shower curtain to close off the shower stall. Keep this closed as much as possible. The warm water from the shower generally contains enough energy to warm up the shower stall, but not enough to warm up the whole bathroom. When you finish your shower, keep the curtain closed and dry off inside the shower stall. If you have a shower head that can be detached and aimed at the walls: at the end of your shower, aim the shower head at the walls and run hot water over the walls. This warms them up. Dry off quickly. A wet skin cools off much quicker than a dry skin. Have a bathrobe (or your clothes) nearby but protected from the water, to minimize the time you spend naked. 
How to clean glass without glass cleaner?
A mixture of equal parts of water and regular vinegar (white distilled or cider) works well. The vinegar smell will disappear quickly.  
How to clean glass without glass cleaner?
White vinegar works as others have said. If you have rubbing alcohol it can be mixed with the vinegar. I would use the paper towels rather than the microfiber as they can be a bit more abrasive for cleaning stubborn grime.
How can I remove ants from my laptop keyboard?
Wash your keyboard in the top rack of an automatic dishwasher. I do not recommend using dish washing liquid...many have bleach in them that will lighten some of the color of the keyboard plastic. Also, don't use a cycle that dries with high heat. Let the keyboard dry completely before using.
how to eat loud food (chips, celery) quietly
Make sure your mouth is closed completely. You can bite slowly, which might sound quieter, though it is really just enlongating the sound. 
How to pinpoint noisy neighbor in panel house
Try listening at the front door of each apartment. Doors are often worse sound insulators than walls, so it should be pretty clear which apartment the sound comes from. 
how to eat loud food (chips, celery) quietly
This trick only really works with chips, and might also be a bit unappetizing. Put the chip in your mouth, and don't bite it right away. Let it soften a little from your saliva. It won't taste quite as crunchy, but it also won't sound so crunchy.After that, bite more slowly with your mouth fully closed, as Doug said.
how to keep bandages close to hand dry and clean
Get a medical rubber glove and cut the fingers off. It keeps the bandage dry but you still have use of your hand. You can seal the edges with sticky medical bandage if you need to, but only short term.If your bandage gets wet you can dry it with a hair dryer, or the hand dryer in a public toilet.
how to eat loud food (chips, celery) quietly
Blend it in a blender. Chips require you to also add some salsa or in general a "wet" component, celery or carrots don't.Carry it to work in a container of some kind and use a spoon to eat.
How to dry out a wet phone?
I feel like my answer is already here, BUT if you dropped the phone in salt water then your best bet to avoid corrosion is to actually soak the phone in isopropyl alcohol, while off of course, for a while. Remove and soak in clean alcohol, repeat a few times to make sure the salt is all gone, then just leave the phone to dry for a couple of days to make absolutely sure it is dry before turning on again. Beware that phones and water don't mix and you likely need a new one, but this method can go a long way in preventing corrosion after the phone is dry. 
How to clean glass without glass cleaner?
You can use straight white vinegar and newspaper to clean glass very well. Spray some vinegar on the surface to be cleaned, then use the newspaper to wipe away dirt and grime. I would recommend wearing gloves to keep from getting any ink on your hands.This method, although super simple and great for people prone to bad reactions to chemical cleaners, might leave some streaks. (I've never noticed any, but I've heard other people complain about it, so maybe it's a technique thing?) Depending on the amount of dirt, it also might require a little more elbow grease than desired. In any case, there are many variations on this theme. This article from Mrs. Clean provides a specifically streak-free formula using ammonia, vinegar, cornstarch, and water, as well as some extra tips on cleaning all things window related.Good luck!
How can I best to get rid of/avoid dog hair on clothes
I know of two ways to remove hair off the top of my head, both can be done easily without buying anything extra.The first thing you can do is get some tape (any will do, not too weak or it won't be as effective).  What you will do is lightly tap the hair with the tape enough so it sticks to it.  Continue with it until you need another piece and/or are done.The second thing I would recommend trying is wetting your hand/palm and rubbing it over the hair, this will have the hair stick to your hand.
Haircare for long rough male hair
You can Avoid shampooing your hair daily.After washing your hair, take 2 egg whites and apply it to your hair. Wait for 10 mins and rinse thoroughly. This will improve shine and prevent breakage.Before going to bed, massage your scalp and hair with coconut oil, wash your hair the next morning.
How to clean glass without glass cleaner?
All you need is water and dish washing liquid (preferably Dawn). Just do like one to two little squirts of dish washing liquid per gallon of water. Works great.Don't use paper towels! They can scratch the glass! I also hear that they produce static electricity which will attract dust back to the windows! Preferably, use a squeegee for washing windows. Doesn't have to be an expensive one. If you don't want to get a squeegee, a microfiber cloth that you already have is a good alternative.
Sleeping in a noisy environment
I found standard cylindrical earplugs are prone to falling out because they are too long: they protrude from the ear, so every time you move your head on the pillow, the earplugs are pushed sideways.I solved this by cutting them in half, making 2 short cylinders.  Note: this works well in my case. If you roll up the earplug and insert it completely into the ear canal, it may be fiddly to remove (although tweezers should be sufficient).  My ear canals are on the small side, so I can't insert a rolled-up earplug.Instead, I wedge a cut-in-half earplug into the opening of the ear canal. This creates a good seal without the need to roll up the earplug, and it leaves the tip of the earplug sticking out far enough to easily remove it. 
How can I best to get rid of/avoid dog hair on clothes
For doing this regularly you need a sticky roller. As the name suggests, this is a roller with a sticky surface and a handle, you roll it over your clothes. The more expensive ones have several layers, so you can peel one off when it's full of hairs. 
Sleeping in a noisy environment
Have you tried asking your housemates to be more considerate about music and how they move about the house at night?In the end you need to peacefully share the space you're in, and if they don't know there's a problem, they can't fix it. If they continue to behave in a way which is disturbing your sleep, you could try the "life hack" of finding somewhere else to live.
Sleeping in a noisy environment
There are some silicone putty earplugs that stay in much better.  The brand I'm familiar with is called bio ears.  They mould into your ear giving them some of the advantages of the custom fitted ones, as well as being more comfortable than effective foam earplugs.
How can I best to get rid of/avoid dog hair on clothes
Pet hair is a necessary consequence of owning a hairy pet and the constant presence of it is something that generally must be considered and accepted before making the decision to own a pet. Your success may be limited as long as you have a dog.House layout permitting, buy indoor gates and don't let the dog in the laundry room or closets.For the remaining hairs remove them with hands or other tools designed for the job, such as lint rollers mentioned in other answer.For a more unorthodox solution, as a hack you could:Shave your dog (removes "hair" from problem).Stop wearing clothes (removes "clothes" from problem).Dye your dog's hair a color that matches your clothes better (removes "white" from problem).Ask a friend to let your dog stay at their house, then never talk to them again (removes "dog" from problem).Avoid mirrors. Pepper spray anybody who looks at you (removes "looking [un]clean" from problem).Etc.
Sleeping in a noisy environment
You could try sleep restriction if this is a long term problem. Limit yourself to a strict 6 hours sleep a night at fixed times (0100 - 0700 for example). Make sure you are only in your room between those hours, so your body gets used to the cycle. The first week of doing this is horrible, but after a while you'll find it's much easier to get to sleep. I used to get pretty bad insomnia and this is the only thing that worked for me. 
Sleeping in a noisy environment
Well, you already found out about white noise, how long did you try it and what did you think about it? Either way, if earplugs are not your thing ambient noise generators are by far the next best option. I find brown noise the easiest to get used to personally and it's perfect for trying to fall asleep (don't need it anymore, but used it for awhile). It takes about two or three days before you stop hearing it (just like a fan) and if you start at a low volume and slowly increase the volume it can easily overcome a lot of outside noise. The only downside is that I have heard about people having trouble falling asleep when they were without it (e.g. when sleeping over and it would disrupt the others in the room).Not all apps have brown and pink noise generators, but if you throw it into Google there are a lot of sites that are capable of generating it. Which reminds me of one other option: Soundscapes. Only used them sometimes when I had trouble falling asleep. They are recordings of things like rain1, nature or other ambient sounds. In principle that should work just as well.1 Small disadvantage of rain: prepare to feel far colder... perfect in summer, but not in winter xD .
How to deal with cockroach at home?
There are a number of household products that you can pick up that are supposed to kill roaches and prevent them from returning.  If you pick up a spray, spray it in any little crevice you can find.  Around and underneath your stove/refrigerator/dishwasher/shelves/cabinets/etc. Any little crack between your walls/floors and anything else.  Get every area they could possible squeeze into because they are very difficult (at best) to get rid of if they find a place they like.  Also, spray around the outside of your building if it is a single residence.  I don't know if it works for cockroaches, but an unbroken line of cinnamon or baking powder in your window sills is supposed to stop ants. These are usually fairly cheap to buy and may be worth a shot.  Same with peppermint oil.  A cotton-ball with peppermint oil on it around your foundation is supposed to stop ants from coming into your house.  Probably because of the sugar content drawing them to that instead of your house, but it may be worth a shot.
Sleeping in a noisy environment
When used as designed, ear plugs will not fall out.  Ear plugs should be rolled between your fingers to make them thinner, then inserted fully into the ear.  You will feel it expand into place and you will hear noise greatly reduce.  I encourage you to watch some videos on the use of ear plugs for more information.Also worth noting is that ear plugs are designed to be single-use.  Repeated removal and insertion will cause them to fit more poorly and reduce their effectiveness.  In the environment you describe, you can probably get away with multiple uses.http://lifehacker.com/5275516/properly-insert-earplugs-for-better-protection
How to deal with cockroach at home?
I'm worried that there is actually more cockroaches.Yes, you have roaches, and there are most certainly more.You will want call an exterminator. Consumer grade traps will have limited effect (especially if you do not have the expertise needed to identify the type of roach). Foggers may have a longer lasting but still temporary effect. Silly little tricks may kill a few here and there or fend a few off for a few hours or days, but if you are asking on Lifehacks then it is unlikely that you are properly equipped to wage a war against one of the most successful and resilient species of life on the planet.As a hack, pay a stranger on the street to call the exterminator for you. This is a life hack because it is an unorthodox use of a stranger.
Sleeping in a noisy environment
I would recommend the app SimplyNoise (iOS link, Android link).You mention that you tried "white noise" apps that "don't have a constant" sound. Actual white noise is completely constant, like static from a TV or radio not tuned to a channel or station.So, if the app you used delivered rain/thunder sound, it was not a white noise app - just a "noise", or "background noise" app. To expand more on the topic: white noite has a precise mathematical definition, which is "a random signal with a constant power spectral density". This means that it has all frequencies in equal amounts contained in it.Although this kind of noise is a bit hard to get used to, you can leverage its property of having all frequencies: this means that it will "mask" noises of all frequencies equally, no matter if it is a small dog barking loud (high frequency) or a bass drum from a trance song.Try to get used to this noise for a few nights. Maybe start at a low volume and increase it gradually. After you get used to it, you just kind of stop noticing it a few minutes after you put it on - it just "fades into the background".If you really can't get used to it, try pink and Brownian ("brown") noise, which SimplyNoise also supports. They are stronger in the lower frequencies and weaker on the higher ones, which makes them sound less "harsh" to the ear. Naturally, this also means they will be less effective at masking higher-frequency noises (some telephones ringing, some breeds of dogs barking, maybe wood squeaking), but really any of them is good enough.Below is a picture of the power spectrum (that is, how much of each frequency the signal has) of white, pink and Brownian noise.I personally like Brownian noise. Very rarely a noise is able to slip past it in my context. To me, it sounds like heavy rain (just perfectly constant and with no thunder), or an airplane's engine, which I find relaxing.
How can I warm up a bathroom without a heater?
Use heat lamps. You can buy some that screw into normal fixtures. Alternatively, use old school incandescent bulbs. They are capable of baking cakes.https://www.1000bulbs.com/product/54310/SATCO-S4751.html?utm_source=SmartFeedPriceGrabber&utm_medium=Shopping&utm_term=SATCOS4751&utm_content=LightBulbsIncandescentInfraredHeatLampsBR38andPAR38InfraredHeatLamps&utm_campaign=SmartFeedPriceGrabber&thissku=SATCO777dash777S4751&site=pricegrabber.com
How to deal with cockroach at home?
I would recommend you to pet a cat in your home (if you're pretty tired of killing roaches). In my case, my cat monitors for any movement on the floor/wall and chases when cockroaches found.
How can I best to get rid of/avoid dog hair on clothes
What you could do:Buy plastic clothes covers. Once you wash your clothes and get the hair off, this will make sure no other hair gets on. Use lint rollers and vacuum cleaners to remove hair on the clothing your dog has touched. A wet clothe rubbed on clothes works in a pinch. Putting your clothes through a clothes dryers can help remove some hair, as well. Visit a vet for your dog, if you feel the hair loss is excessive. This could be a sign of illness. Hair cuts and regular grooming can help control this. Don't wear things the hair will get attracted to, like wooly sweaters. Also, don't let your dog around your clothes. Getting plastic furniture covers and vacuuming carpets regularly can help with this. 
How do I prevent a bookmark tassel from fraying?
What you could do:Burn the end of it slightly. This would make the end discolored, but would stop fraying and keep most of the color of the bookmark. This works if it is Nylon or similar. You could take a band, rubber or a hair band, and put it around the place of fraying, this would discourage more fraying and can look quite pretty. Braiding the fray and tying off the end also work. If you can braid with many strands this might help. But this may not work, as the strand are short. You can also get tapes in many colors. So if you wanted, you might find one that would match the tassel. Either way the fraying should be fixed as soon as possible, otherwise more fraying will continue. 
How do I prevent a bookmark tassel from fraying?
Pour some thin (!) cyanoacrylate glue (superglue) on the end of the tassel, at the point where it starts fraying. The tassel will absorb the glue; use just enough that the glue is spread along the full width and depth of the tassel. The glue must be thin enough for the capillary effect to work. CA gel is too thick.The glue keeps the threads together and prevents further fraying. The only visible effect is a slight change in color.I've used this on tassels and on e.g. luggage straps.  
How can I pit a bowlful of olives?
Here is a Cherry/Olive pitter on Amazon UK.I've tried using one in the past and I found it to be quite difficult. I understand the factories tend to do them whilst slight under-ripe. If you use it on soft ones they tend to squish rather too easily.Having said that, I've spoken to someone who told me that they can use one on soft cherries with no problem so maybe you'd get used to it after a while.
How to dry out a wet phone?
To dry out a phone after its been wet, do not put out in the sun to dry it out.Take it apart and put the pieces in uncooked rice. Worked for me and the rice should absorb the moisture. You might need to replace battery.
How to dry out a wet phone?
The most important part is to remove the battery and be patient. I've seen many phones killed by owners growing impatient and trying to turn them on before they are clean and dry.Let me make that part very clear, because it's the most tempting way to mess up: Under no reasonable circumstances should you power it on before you feel certain it is completely clean and dry.Remove the batterySoak it in isopropyl alcohol. The stuff you get for first-aid is not pure (enough) isopropyl alcohol. It is a mix of 70% isopropyl alcohol and 30% distilled water, typically. For this application you will want at least 90% isopropyl alcohol. Also, if the water was clean (i.e., RO or distilled), you can skip this step.Let it dry. This would be accelerated by surrounding it with rice or anhydrous magnesium sulphate. The latter can be produced by lining an oven-safe pan with foil and baking at 500 degrees until it melts and solidifies again. Remember, though, salt leads to corrosion and rust, so ensure that the desiccant does not come into direct contact with the phone. Finally, remember "accelerated" does not mean "instantaneous," so still be as patient as you can afford.EDIT: Because it's been mentioned in a comment, DO NOT PUT THE PHONE IN THE EPSOM SALT WHILE IT IS IN THE OVEN.In case it wasn't clear, this is the process for turning Epsom salt into anhydrous magnesium sulphate. You put the phone in a sealed container with the COOLED anhydrous magnesium sulphate to help it dry (because it wants to get those 7 water molecules back and turn into Epsom Salt again).
Ways of waterproofing a watch
Cling wrap is waterproof and transparent enough. Cut a bit of cling wrap, wrap it around the watch face and use office sticky tape to hold it tight on the two bracelet sides.Cling wrap can be unpleasant to the touch. To alleviate this, you may take a bit of discarded cloth and affix it to the cling wrap on the back side of the watch. I'm not sure how to make it stay, as adhesive tend to fare poorly on cloth.Cling wrap is somewhat fragile: it risks getting cut if it snags somewhere. You may prefer to cut a bit of PVC plastic bag (Ziploc, as opposed to plastic shopping bags). They are usually transparent and rigid enough, and more resistant to cuts than cling wrap.
How do I clean the inside of a keyboard that I spilled a drink into?
Quick and easy: try to pop off offending key caps and carefully clean through the hole with a damp cotton swab. Though I'm not familiar with the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard, most key caps (other than Space, Enter and Shift) can be removed by pulling on a hook made from a paper clip or with strong sewing thread pushed underneath.If many keys are badly stuck and if the drink is completely water-soluble (e.g. soda) as opposed to a mixture (such as hot chocolate), the keyboard can be washed in high purity or distilled water (not tap water, rainwater or deionized water), even immersed in it. Of course, the keyboard will not be usable for a while.If the keyboard has a battery, as all wireless keyboards do, the battery must be removed first and not reinserted until the unit is completely dry, inside and out. It should not be plugged into a port until dry, either.To speed up drying, the keyboard can be rinsed in 99% ethanol or isopropanol, but that adds to the cost of repair.
How to light a match?
Strike-anywhere matches exist and solve this problem. Be aware that they are not legal for passenger or cargo planes in most of the world.They're basically the original matches. The ones that require the lighter strip on the box were just matches engineered for safety and are more widely promoted.Waterproof matches exist as well, and solve this problem even more effectively.Note that strike-anywhere matches aren't actually that much more expensive, nor are waterproof matches (for example, 900 strike-anywhere matches runs about $12, I see 320 for $6, etc.; 160 waterproof matches run around $4.50...). They're the right tool for the job; anything else will be end up being more of a pain than your current wet matches.If you do not want to use an appropriate type of match, then I suppose you could use anything around you that gets hot enough to light a match. Exactly what meets this requirements will depend on the situation you are in.
Ways of waterproofing a watch
TL;DR: Concrete solutions in bold below.It's not a waterproof watch. You'll have to accept this. If you insist on wearing it around water, then you need to decide if the risk is worth the benefit. "Life hacks" can't make the impossible possible, regardless of how badly you want it to be possible.Wrapping it in something waterproof, as you are already doing, reduces - but does not eliminate - the risk. That's about all you can do.Most answers to this question will be suggestions for answerers' various favorite water-resistant material, generally some form of plastic in a bag, sheet, or box-like shape; anything that fits this description will do. Choose your favorite and wrap away; hopefully you can find various appropriate materials around you without having to have them all explicitly listed here.(Also, the best solution to the problem of your friends ruining your watches with water is to rethink letting your friends have access to your non waterproof watches.)
How to light a match?
Modern safety matches (unlike the strike anywhere matches @Jason C mentions),only light under 2 conditions (to my knowledge),Reacting with the substance on the "Lighting Strip",Getting hot (as when you light one with a candle).I have no idea how to replicate the former,but getting it hot enough, can be done.Obviously, lighting it with another flame is generally redundant,but hot things exist.I theorise a car exhaust could do it, a car cigarette lighter, or electric stove definitively could.Another is focused light (or heat), from a magnifying glass.Theoretically you could use anything that can focus light to a rough point -- such as the curved part of a bottle.Magnifying GlassWhile it is very hard to set paper alight with a magnifying glass,it is quite easy to make a very hot point -- enough to burn a hole in paper, or light a match.Place the match on a suitable steady surface (eg rest your hand holding it on a wall)Position the glass with the sun going through it, you should see a bright projection of light onto the surface in front of itMove the glass backwards or forwards to focus this projected light to a pointposition the focus point of bright light over the match headwait a few minute/seconds for the match to heat up enough to igniteuse the match to light something less likely to go out (eg a candle out of the wind) ConsThere are many downsides to this solution (and I would love to hear alternatives)Times when you most want matches, you are often out of the sun: Overcast winter, night time, indoorsMagnifying glass is not the most common thing to carry around with youIf it is not hot/bright enough, and you try this and it doesn't work, you look like a fool trying somethey saw on TV
How to clean glass without glass cleaner?
In India we use cheap and best glass cleaner called 'vibhuti'(It is a whitish soft powder which is produced after baking cow dung cakes). Take a cup of vibhuti, mix it with a cup of water to form a paste. Smear this paste all over the glass & let it dry for 3 minutes. Use 100% cotton cloth to wipe up.With a single wipe your glass will be clean & super shiny.
Ways of waterproofing a watch
Another variant of using a plastic bag is to do as follows:Take a plastic bag which you are just able to insert your hand into, and cut of the bottom of it, so it becomes a sleevePut the sleeve (in blue color) on your hand, and then wear your watch on the outsideWrap the sleeve back over your watch, as suggested in (my perfectly drawn :-) ) imageThe trick to getting it waterproof is to fold the upper part of the now doubled sleeved plastic bag. I've provided two alternatives:a) Using hair elastic or similar, attach one above the watch, and wrap plastic over the hair elastic (shown from the side in green color). Attach another hair elastic close to the watch, and wrap the plastic back again, and attach a third hair elastic inbetween the two others. This should be enough to make it pretty waterproof. Tuck the end underneath the other layers for a neat finishb) Using a wider elastic of some sort (or possibly tape), attach at the top, and start rolling the plastic bag down towards the watch a few turnsOther alternatives for folding up the plastic bag can involve just rolling it and tucking it under the watch (which I now see in the picture I've drawn on the inside of the arm. Strange! )A disadvantage of this method is that it can be a little difficult to wrap/fold the plastic if you are alone, and maybe you don't have hair elastics. On the plus side it is a cheap, working solution, and can look good if executed well.
Stopping my shirt from falling up when I run
How you are able to "happily run" beats me, but here are two thoughts which might help you on the way:Get bag closer to backIf you wear it like a messenger bag, close to your body it will move less. One way to get it really close is to put it over your shoulder, bend over forward, and tighten it real close to your chest.Getting it close like described above, not only makes it move less, but it is actually making it easier and less stressful to carry.Lock shirt in placeMaybe not as easily done, as said. Two options spring to mind, and that is using longer shirts tucked well into trousers, and the other (maybe surer, but not as convenient) is to somehow strap it onto your trousers.The latter could be done using clothespins (/pegs), safety pins, maybe a belt, or something similar.
How to straighten a bent tent-peg
My trick to getting them unbent is to use something of the same shape, like a few other tent-pegs, to use as a mould and then beat/bend them into shape again. That is, if they are shaped in v-form, you can put two or three together, put them on the ground, and then put the bent tent-peg on top of these and apply force to the bend to get it conform to the others.You could also use a box, or something with a hard edge, and put it on top of this before applying force to getting it back in shape.Note that most likely they will maintain a slight bend, and be careful how much force (and bending) you apply as this will weaken the peg. 
How can I drive a tent peg into gravel?
Stop fighting the natureStop fighting the nature, and let it work for you: Use the large stones to lock down your tent.Either by directly placing them on top of the edges of the tent, if possible. Or by using a variant of the sand bags you're talking about, but using rocks from the campsite instead of the sand. Depending on type of tent and weather conditions, you don't always need to use every webbing/stake/tent loop there is.Pegs in gravel is simply not a good way to go, so you should look into alternatives like the ones above, or go to a better campsite. In most gravel the pegs will not provide good hold anyway.Edit: Added next section based on commentsUsing stones to secure tentThe four main methods for using stones to secure a tent can be summarised as follows:a) Put a stone on the corner/side of the tent roof, which could lower (or require lowering) the height a bit, and possibly bend the pole of tunnel tent. This does work for some manufacturers/designsb) Put a stone in the inner tent in the corners, or possibly on the straps connecting inner and out tentc) Put a twig/branch through a tent loop, and put stones on both endsd) The big rock/little rock trick, as shown in this video where one ties a rope/string/guideline to a little rock, tightens it and secures the little rock with a big rock on top of the line.  
What is the best way to use a tower fan and an oil heater to heat a room quickly?
Place the heater in the middle of the room. Place the fan near the heater, aim the air stream at the heater and away from the coldest point in the room (e.g. windows). Run the fan at its lowest setting. You don't need much airflow.If the hallway to your room is heated, place the fan in the door opening to transfer some of the warm air from the hallway to the room.  
How to have cross ventilation in a single window room?
Find a mesh (e.g. chicken wire) that is strong enough to keep out the cat. Fit that across the window opening like a screen door, so you can leave the window open at night. Maybe add a layer of fine mesh (mosquito net) to keep out the bugs.

What's the most time efficient way to completely clean teeth?
Multi-taskAssuming you have no disabilities and have two arms/hands, you use only one hand to brush your teeth. You therefore have another hand free, which can be used for many other purposes. The main example would be:Chores like putting away the dishes, taking out the trash, loading the dishwasher, etc. etc.You can also doExercise: Lift weights with your free arm.To clean my teeth, I brush my teeth twice a day (manual toothbrush, ordinary toothpaste) and floss my teeth once every other day. I take an unusually long time each time I brush my teeth (about 4 minutes or 240 seconds). I don't use mouthwash or any thing else. Dentists often remark that my oral health is very good.While brushing my teeth, I do other things with my free hand. The important thing (if you want to optimize your time) is to make sure that you are not distracted and you are steadily brushing your teeth even while you multi-task. This might take a few days of practice.
Stopping my shirt from falling up when I run
I've had this problem as well. Here are a couple ideas: Get a running shirt. These are designed to be very ultra-lightweight. Even if they do catch or run up a bit, it will just fall back down instead of catching on itself like a regular shirt. The downside is you have to wear a running shirt all the time.Wear a tighter shirt so that it doesn't flop around when you run AND use a light rain jacket as a guard. The jacket should be also very lightweight and shiny so it acts as a barrier between your shirt and the backpack. It's less likely to snag when you run.
How to move furniture up and down stairs?
Use a winch or a come-along to pull the furniture up the stairs. You may need to anchor it to a wall, stud, door, or something else that will not move. You will also need some type of straps to wrap around the furniture. These can be purchased at any big box hardware store, auto parts store, or moving company. Lastly, you will need a method of making the stairs slick enough that furniture parts that stick out don't get caught. I have found that a piece of plywood laid on the steps usually works well for this. Placing a blanket between the plywood and the furniture to be moved cuts down on the friction between them.If you have to turn a sharp corner, you can use a pulley to change the angle of the cable (providing that you can mount it safely) or a device (a block of wood) that the cable uses as an inverted pulley to change the angle of the pulled item.
Fix airflow in our apartment
First, stop the extra heat from the window by putting up plastic in the window. Painters plastic should be good, just get a correctly sized piece and tape it up, making sure to completely seal the plastic to the window frame. Next, I would put a big fan in a cold part of the living room and aim it down the hall to your room with the door open to let the cold air in. Or you could blow the hot air from your room towards the thermostat so that the ac runs until your room is closer to acceptable. If you want to block the big vent, you should take the vent down, then put the cardboard over the vent, then put the vent back up so the cardboard stays in place.

How do you get into or out of a car during rain without getting wet?
I usually tend to get into the car, partly close the door with the umbrella held just high enough to go over the door. Hold the top part with your right hand, and move the bottom handle up to fold the umbrella with your left hand. After closing, move it inside the car, and close the door.When opening the umbrella (to the left) I start high up, and likewise when closing I end high up close to the ceiling of the car (to the right). But when actually getting in or out of the car, the umbrella is barely above the roof (like in the middle of the picture).This procedure works well enough for me, not to have considered any other options. Can get a little wet on the bottom of my arms, but otherwise both me and the car is dry! I store the umbrella between my seat and the door, so it is ready for the next time it rains. 
Thaw out just one piece of meat
As commented on question, and from reviewing similar question, there are (seemingly) no life-hacks to easily separate the chicken parts once they are frozen besides the options you've already mentioned, and possibly to use a flat tool of some sort to wedge in between the chicken pieces to break them apart.So my suggestions is to go an alternative route: Defreeze everything, and make the dinner you've planned, but at the same time cook some pasta and use the left over chicken to create a beautiful chicken pasta to eat in the next few days!  This will take a little amount of extra time today, but tomorrow you'll have an already prepared meal! 
Cheap way to hang a poster without frame
Not sure if this qualifies as a life-hack, because you have the standard options of:Nailing/stapling it to the frameUsing tape, either double-side or single-sided. Use more if it falls down...Using some sticky goo, like blu-tack or similar stuffDepending on your frame, add a back panel or front frame, and wedge the poster between these (Could also be done using plexi glass panels)Glue it onto the frame
Thaw out just one piece of meat
Run them under cold water, not hot (you don't want to start cooking them). Just hold the frozen mass under the water such that one of them separates, then the other.
Thaw out just one piece of meat
It's worth mentioning that a lot of meat processing companies actually do a lot of butchery work on frozen meat. They use power tools to cut through the meat when it is frozen solid.What we can learn from this is that IF you have some method of cutting the meat into the portion sizes you need, you can do it whilst frozen and return the unwanted portion to the freezer unaffected. This means that you don't necessarily have to divide it into pieces of chicken so long as you are prepared to dice the chicken once defrosted to make into pie, stew etc.So, how to chop it into portions whilst frozen? Assuming you don't have any CLEAN woodworking tools around, you can try either 1) an electric carving knife or 2) a large, heavy, meat cleaver. A good bread knife might be able to get somewhere.I would VERY MUCH caution against trying to use a knife to lever the pieces apart. You usually end-up with a piece of meat standing on its edge and one of your hands trying to steady it, then you press the sharp point of a knife with almost as much force as you can muster into the meat. Inevitably, this results in the meat tipping over and the point of the knife slipping off and into your hand very hard.
Thaw out just one piece of meat
Wrap each portion in something water absorbant such as a sheet of kitchen roll before you freeze them. This way, when you need to defrost them the water should be quickly absorbed through the fibres and melt the ice crystals that would otherwise be freezing the portions of meat together
Fix airflow in our apartment
Two options spring to mind. First is to relocate into the living room with your computers as that room seems to be the coolest. In one flat I lived in I swapped rooms so that the master bed room became the living room and vice versa. The other thought was that instead of blocking vent 1, which might damage the vent, what about rerouting the air flow? If you get a properly sized tube/pipe and then divide the output in  two parts where one half enters the tube going through the hall and into your master bedroom it might solve your problem. 
What's the most time efficient way to completely clean teeth?
My technique is to use mouthwash first thing in the morning and before bed. I do this to reduce the bacterial population as possible as its this bacteria that feed on the food on our teeth and cause the decay.Then I try (location permitting) to brush my teeth after eating or drinking sugary drinks. My logic is that with reduced bacteria it hopefully means the bacteria are producing the acid slower and therefore limiting tooth decay
How can I increase my reading speed?
The place where people "waste" the most time reading is moving their eyes from word to the next. Spritz is an app that flashes words on-at-a-time onto a small screen, which means that your eyes don't waste time moving between words.You can try it online, or you can use it with various software (they even have a free bookmarklet). An less original alternative exists in spreeder.
How can I increase my reading speed?
Speed reading is all about how you move your eyes. Using your periferal vision, there are patterns you can train your eyes to follow that will help you read faster while not sacrificing comprehension. The great thing about this method is you don't need any software or any extra "parts".(I'm going to be using diagrams throughout this post: the red "highlights" over the text represent the position of of your eyes when you read each word. Let me know in the comments if this makes sense.)Word by word:Beginner readers focus their eyes on each individual word. This technique works, but it's a lot slower than it could be. People who use this method often read aloud, or use their finger to track their position in the text (they can do this because they are reading word-by-word).Reading "in clumps"Better readers don't skip words, they read multiple words at the same time using their peripheral vision:Here's another demonstration of this technique (from IrisReading.com):This text was originally a large paragraph, but the tutorial split it up into three columns. Using their peripheral vision, most people will be able to read the group of words in each column (in each line) using one glance. When the text isn't broken up into columns, readers can still use this technique by focusing on clumps of words instead of individual words. Using peripheral vision allows readers to read more words while spending less time moving their eyes between each word. Thus, this technique dramatically increases reading speeds.Advanced (impossible): reading entire lines at once:This is theoretically possible, but I've never seen someone use it. The idea is that if your peripheral vision is wide enough, you could be able to read an entire line in one glance. Most people will not be able to do this.Putting these techniques into practice.Half the battle is just being aware of how your eyes move when you read. When you read an article (on paper would be best, for learning purposes), try to pay attention to how your eyes focus.The next step is to train your eyes to use the more efficient motions. You can do this just by making a conscious effort to read in specific ways (which words for me), or you could use a pencil beforehand to indicate focal points for your eyes when practising (e.g. if you are using the "in clumps" method, draw a visual cue every three words to attract your eyes to that spot).

What are some quick ways to cool off at home, in extreme heat, if the electricity has gone out?
Go to the washroom and turn on the shower, cold water, full blast. Close the bathroom door and window. Pull up a small chair so you're positioned not far from the running water. Depending on how strong your shower-head is, you should be cooling off in a short while from the vapor of the cold water.

You could also arrange or use some sort of fan. Hand held fans are quite useful and effective, and doesn't require too much energy to handle.  Or go large scale and make some arrangement with a blanket/curtain attached to a rope which when pulled would move and increase the air flow in the room and create a fresh breeze. 
How to prevent ice cream from melting without a refrigerator?
Instead of buying the ice cream at the start of your shift, buy it at the end of your shift. If there's some reason you can't do that, then bring a cooler filled with ice. If a cooler doesn't work, then buy a mini-freezer and bring it to work.

Jump under the shower. But for the last minutes you should shower hot, this will open your skin pores and allows your body to better control your temperature for the next hours.
What are some quick ways to cool off at home, in extreme heat, if the electricity has gone out?
I always do the following:-A cotton cloth that is ready to be washed, using which you can rub off sweat from your body. This will at least give you some relief from the running sweat off your body, which tickles for some people.Small hand-held fans that will not hurt your hand, and will also give quick airflow to your body.Sit down or lie down for 5-10 minutes at least, keeping yourself calm, without doing any activity.  I tried going under shower to cool off, but that doesn't help you after 2-3 minutes, if your body is always doing some activity - like slowly walking or getting tensed.So the best option is to remain calm for 5-10 minutes or more, and follow all the above-mentioned steps.Hope it helps!

What are some quick ways to cool off at home, in extreme heat, if the electricity has gone out?
I can't imagine what it must be like in the heat in India, but here in the UK, when we get one of the 5 or 6 days a year where it's too hot, I always find that I feel much more comfortable if I can keep my HEAD cool.I fill a sink with the coolest water available and dunk my head under. For some reason it seems to be particularly effective to enter the water with the crown of the head first. Hold your face under as long as you can, he water will soon start to get too warm so the effect is lost.I then splash some of the water on arms, neck and other places where I get sticky with sweat.Crucially, I don't dry myself afterwards but let the water evaporate and cool me again. This works very well when your hair is wet because it takes a long time to evaporate away.
What are some quick ways to cool off at home, in extreme heat, if the electricity has gone out?
If you need to cool down but do not want to get wet - I would firstly recommend against the 'hack' of putting a cold cloth or ice on your neck. The reason is that all this is doing is cooling the blood coming through yor carotid artery that then goes directly to the brain - with the consequence of tricking your brain into thinking your body has reached a normal temperature and swwitching off the normal biological response of sweating to cool yourself down again.To get your core body temperature back down to normal I personally would try a combination of the following:Get as much airflow over the skin as possible to maximise the evaporation of sweat (fan/aircon/driving with windows open)increase the water resting on the skin - as evaporation is an endothermic process which draws heat away from its surroundings (in our case - our skin/blood)Drink something cold to cool the body from the stomach outwards

How to remove ball pen marks from the clothes?
First off, you need to determine what kind of ink stain you're dealing with.Not all pens with a ball are actual "ballpoint" pens.Traditional ballpoint pens (like the ubiquitous Bic and Paper Mate) use a fast-drying, oil-based ink that requires a solvent to remove.1 Rollerball pens, on the other hand, (common manufacturers include Uni-Ball and Pilot), use water-based inks that are fairly easy to remove, while gel pens use a highly-pigmented type of ink that can be a bit more difficult.2If you're certain it's an oil-based ink:Find a suitable solvent. Common isopropyl alcohol is suitable for most stain-removal jobs and can be purchased generically at a pharmacy, for example rubbing alcohol.Place the stained garment on several layers of paper towels, so the ink has somewhere to go.Apply your alcohol-based solvent of choice.Wait 3-5 minutes. The solvent needs a few minutes to break down the oils in the ink.Blot the stain using layers of white paper towels.Repeat as needed.If it's water-based ink:Soak the stained garment in (skim) milk.Wait for at least half an hour.Scrub the stain gently with a toothbrush, cuticle brush or similar soft-bristled brush.Rinse thoroughly with warm water.And if it's highly-pigmented ink:Hand-wash with soap or regular detergent as quickly as possible.Rinse thoroughly with running water.Try to blot any remaining ink by pressing the fabric between two absorbent cloths, or stacks of napkins or paper towels.Dissolve 1 teaspoon of ammonia in warm water.Soak the garment in the ammonia solution for one hour.Repeat steps 1 & 2 and scrub with a soft brush, if needed.If the stain is responding to this treatment, repeat as needed until the ink is gone, and launder as usual.Mix 1 cup of rubbing alcohol with 1 cup of vinegar.Place the garment on a clean, dry towel and apply the solution.Let it soak for at least 5 minutes.Pour a small amount of table salt over the stain.Wait 10 minutes.Scrub with a soft brush and rinse with hot water.If the stain is responding to this treatment, repeat as needed until the ink is gone, and launder as usual.You may have to experiment with the above steps (hence the horizontal lines) or try other methods. Just make sure to rinse the garment very thoroughly between different methods to avoid mixing chemicals.Sources:about.com - How to Remove Ball Point Pen InkwikiHow.com - How to Remove Ball Point Pen Stains from Cottonabout.com - Steps to Remove Ballpoint, Permanent, and Water-Based Ink

How to keep long hair from getting everywhere?
Nothing, except ask the person you live with to keep their hair tied up all the time when indoors, either in a pony tail or pinned up. You will still get some hair about the place when they loosen it, unless you expect the person to tie it up before they come in the door and not loosen it till they leave again. Which isn't a particularly reasonable request, I'd have thought, if they live there. Good thing you can't see all the skin flakes and other detritus that drops off human beings as they move around, including you, and including your own hair. Its just not noticeable if your hair is short.
Pest Control - Natural Method of Ant Control - Howto
We use a homemade version of Terro to kill ants.  It works slowly but kills the entire colony as they take it back.  Commercial Terro is 5.4% borax in a sweet solution.  My homemade Terroid is 25 grams of borax in a 16 ounce bottle of store brand Karo, so it makes a lot.   We also have termites and the borax I use is Timbor but I think any drugstore boric acid or 20 Mule Team works.  25 grams is a little less than an ounce but I don't think the amount is critical, in fact, mine doesn't all dissolve. It helps to warm it to dissolve it.  I just put the bottle into hot water.Very Important Step 1: deface label of the Karo so it can't be confused and write poison on it.I find it easiest to decant some into a dropper bottle.  For inside use, where I don't want this sticky goo on things,  I put it onto an old CD near their trail with drops at the edge so they find it. Then if it dries too much for them to eat it I just wash the CD and dot it again. Ants don't seem to mind stepping onto a CD (there are some things they don't like, foil, oily surfaces, etc.)

Pest Control - Natural Method of Ant Control - Howto
I know you said no pesticides, but there is a little box called a bait box that works like a miracle. I have used these a few times in the past. The ants have to walk into the box, eat the food inside, and carry it back to their nest. Once in the nest the food is poisonous to the Queen. Within a couple of days the ants will be gone, and they will not come back. These have worked VERY well for me in the past, and I like them because you don't have to spray poison that you could breathe or get on you. You just put out the little plastic boxes.

If you don't mind not re-using the ziploc bag, and have something to cut with, then cut off one of the bottom two corners (just like how you'd turn a ziploc into a pastry bag). Now it's a funnel for easy pouring.Another option: if you fold back the top of the ziploc bag (so the top inch or so is inside out, the zip seal part facing out) it'll pour better. Also reusable this way. Other than that, there are small, plastic airtight containers intended for stuff like this.

How to keep track of how many uses a razor blade has left
There are a few ways I would like to suggest you, Indoor security cameras might help you. You can have one near your shaving place (washbasin maybe). Since most of the system have 24/7  surveillance, so you can simply track down the usage of the blade by fast forwarding your video. It also shows the exact time and date of your usage.Take a micro tip permanent marker and write the date on the blade. You can write the date when you installed it or the date when to change it. This helps you to track the usage based on date.Or simply check out the blades, based on the usage blades have small red dots(rust) due to oxidation. This is a visible clue to know the usage. So if your razor blade have more red dots then its time to change it.

Preparing to have a cast put on; anything to do to preemptivly prevent scratching
Giving the area a wash using an exfoliant to get off as much dead skin as possible, but without damaging the skin, then applying a perfume free emollient such as Diprobase will help initially, but may not be possible because the area is too painful with whatever problem you've got that requires a cast. Itching beneath casts is caused because of the presence of the cast - dead skin cells can't be washed off nor fall off because they're trapped inside the cast, they build up, and your skin starts to itch because the body wants you to abrade the area to remove the build up. I'm afraid it's something up with which you must put, to coin a phrase - using a hairdryer set on cool and aiming it between the cast and your skin (if there's a little gap after a while) might ease the itching for a short period. Some anti histamines will reduce the itching, if you can take those.

How to keep track of how many uses a razor blade has left
I think you need abandon the idea of keeping track of the number of times you use the blade unless you want to go to the overkill method of "self surveillance" in Harish's answer.Personally, I work on the basis of the first time I notice that the shave was even slightly uncomfortable, I immediately throw away the blade to force me to replace it before the next shave.If you don't think that will work for you, I think you need to get your wife her own razor - they do them in pink for this very reason. If your wife has some objection to using a pink razor then you use the pink one instead, you just need to keep them separate. With your wife removed from the randomness, you can start to change the blade after a regular TIME period rather than after a certain number of uses; maybe every Saturday or the first of the month or whatever regularity suits your usage and your wallet.If you like none of the above, the question implies that you would like to MARK the blade somehow. I don't think you'll be able to do that with a blade but there's a lot more scope for that if you switch to using disposable razors instead. Then you can mark the handle somehow, perhaps by nicking it or even biting it maybe.
How to Avert / Deflect refrigerator heat in room?
I've built temporary ducting using cardboard and duct tape. Just create a duct from your exhaust vent to the window. For extra cooling add a fan to blow air away from the fridge. This may or may not be possible depending on where the fridge and window are located.

How to remove smell from a new water bottle?
Wash it with hot soapy water then leave to drip dry. If, when dry, the smell remains then fill with water and put in the fridge for 24+ hours. This should remove the smell. Always make sure when not in use that the lid stays off. Keep the bottle somewhere cool and dry when not using and without the lid on.

Another suggestion would be to freeze the bottle with water and lemon juice inside it, after all has frozen you'll need to empty the bottle and wash with warm soapy water and rinse well.
How to keep track of how many uses a razor blade has left
Note: this is not how to count but an easy hack you can avoid this long procedure.Always keep one extra blade,so whenever you feel it is not going to work or not working,change it that time ,or else you will end up cutting yourself.you can easily know that razor is not perfect at first glide , so keep an extra blade always and change it.
How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
Okay, here's how I do it...What a plunger does is add some pressure to the water exiting the bottom of the toilet.  With this trick I haven't used a plunger for years. First, try to flush and pay particular attention to how high the water comes in the bowl, and notice how much more water could be added to the bowl at 'high tide' without overflow.Second, take a container (I usually used the bathroom trash can with the trash removed and placed on the floor) and fill it in the bathtub with less than the amount needed to overflow.Third, pull the lever and flush the toilet and while the toilet is filling with water from the reservoir, pour the water from the trash can into the toilet, aiming for the drain in the bottom.  Try to pour from waist height to get the extra pressure of the water dropping into the bowl.  The added pressure of the extra water is usually enough to free most blockages.  Away goes the trouble and you don't have to splash around in dirty water.  
How to keep track of how many uses a razor blade has left
Set up 10 small boxes in a row.  Number each.  When you put in a new blade, put your shaver in the first box.  When you or your wife uses it, put it back in the next box each time. When you take it out of the 10th box and use it, you know it's time to change the blade.I could see myself forgetting what box I took it out of, so I'd probably put a pebble or a marble or something in the same box with my shaver.  I'd take out the shaver, move the pebble/marble to the next box, shave, and then just put the shaver into the same box as the pebble/marker.
How to keep track of how many uses a razor blade has left
Get 11 small pieces of scratch paper that are all the same size.  (I use the backs of old business cards.  They're white, sturdy, and all 2" x 3.5".)On each one, write one of these: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, "change blade"Stack them up in order, 1-10, with "1" face-up on the top, and "change blade" face-up at the bottom of the stack.Put your shaver next to them (or on top of them, though it might make them wet).Each time you or your wife picks up the shaver to use it, take the top card and put it face-up on the bottom of the stack.When the card that says "change blade" comes up, change the blade and put that card on the bottom of the stack. The "1" card will be showing again, and they'll all be in order. :)My wife and I use this technique for feeding our fish 6 days and skipping the 7th. Our cards show days of the week, so we can also tell if one of us already fed him that day.

How can I remove impurities from water easily when my water purifier is not working?
Depending on the specific situation, often times boiling water is enough to kill the bacteria and pathogens that may be found in contaminated water.If you are looking to filter out minerals or microscopic debris/particulates, perhaps running the water through a coffee machine with charcoal crumbles used as "grounds" will help the situation. not only will the water be heated up to a hot temperature to kill organisms, but it will also be filtered through the charcoal.

How can I remove impurities from water easily when my water purifier is not working?
You can also find iodine tablets in most sporting goods stores. You can also add a little bit of bleach to your water. The tablets are easy to use, and I'm not sure how much bleach to use because adding too much is dangerous. Truthfully though, as was previously mentioned boiling is your best option. If you have a distiller you could distill the water. Or to make one boil water and place something over the pot to collect the steam like a small tarp, then let the steam cool and form back into water and collect the water. With the tarp make sure the low end of the tarp is not over you pan so that water will drop down for you to catch. Edit: drinking distiller water is not good for your health if taken in either large quantities or over a long period of time. Osmosis will leach the electrolytes from you into the water and could eventually kill you. But for a short period of time in normal quantities you should be fine. 
How can I remove impurities from water easily when my water purifier is not working?
You can use a folded muslin cloth (folding will create multiple layers) to filter out suspended impurities. After that you can use potassium permanganate to disinfect it (if you cannot boil the water). Potassium permanganate is available in all drug stores.Coming to the concentration of potassium permanganate, this - EPA guidelines, will help you out. If you don't get any muslin cloth, you can also use filter paper(costly when compared to muslin cloth and not reusable) used to prepare coffee, etc.
Diesel fuel smell out of clothing?
Short answer: No, there isn't.From what I've found, all solutions suggest that you soak it in something for 12+ hours.Try one or more of the following things:Coca-ColaMouthwash (e.g. Listerine)Baking sodaAmmoniaVinegarYou can also try to use them in combination.Here is the solution I liked the most:Try soaking the clothes in a tub of warm water or washer, after agitating a few minutes with 1 cup of Tide or degreaser like Dawn dish soap, for 2 hours (this breaks down oils in fuel). Drain this water off, then rinse, and then refill tub or washer with warm clean water and a 2 liter bottle of Coke and a whole box of baking soda agitate it around to mix it up with the clothes. Let this soak for 12-24 hours. Wash like normal.Others just suggest adding the above products to a usual wash with detergent. I did not test one of the methods, but I think that soaking for a few hours will result in a more thorough cleaning.If washing with some extra product is a quick way for you, then I have to revise my short answer to: Yes, there is!Sources:thriftyfun.com - Removing Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Odors From Clothingstretcher.com - How to Get Diesel Smell Out of Clothesehow.com - How to Get Rid of Diesel Fuel Smell
How to remove smell from a new water bottle?
To remove unwanted smells of a new bottle we have to keep in mind that the substances involved may not be water-soluble. Therefore simply washing may not suffice to remove them.There are several approaches we can try (if needed also in combination):Vinegar or alcohol from bottom shelf liquor: Leaving the bottle for some hours filled with vinegar or liquor will effectively remove poorly water-soluble chemicals but it may leave an unwanted other smell instead.Milk: Fill the bottle with warm milk and let it sit in the fridge over night. Milk is good at taking up lipid-based substances but we will have to throughoughly wash the bottle afterwards to remove all remnants of milk which otherwise would smell worse after a while.Baking soda and water: putting some teaspoons of baking soda in the bottle to then fill it with water overnight may help in removing some unwanted smells but it will not work good on non-water-soluble substances.Denture cleaner or dishwasher tabs: The chemicals used in these preparations may also help to remove unwanted smells by additionally breaking up organic substances.My favourite method definitely is milk, because of its potential to bind lipid-soluble chemicals which may be released from the plastic bottle. By this we can be a little bit less concerned about potential harm to our health from an unknown substance we smelled.Still if it was me I would not take the risk of using a weirdly smelling plastic bottle for drinks, simply because I don't know what chemicals there are, and I can see that more and more substances involved in plastic production were being proven to be harmful.

How to get rid of mosquitoes without electricity?
Citronella is a natural repellent.  It can be used to discourage mosquitoes.Although it is available in the form of scented candles, I'd rather not burn these while I'm sleeping. I just use them in the evening.Citronella is available as an Essential Oil from aromatherapy shops.  Put just a few drops of this into some water, then dampen around the edge of the bed with it.  It is not necessary to use the oil in its concentrated form, it works better diluted and distributed.It isn't 100% effective but it comes close.

How to clean a keyboard without a vacuum cleaner
You can buy "Tinned Air" from electrical shops.  Otherwise known as "Canned Air" or "Air Duster".  These are aerosols that just blow air in a directed jet.  They are intended for just this use.Keep one nearby and blow the dust off the keys when required.
How to clean a keyboard without a vacuum cleaner
You can also wipe it clean with microfiber cloths or similar. In addition you can either use cotton swabs (Q-tips), or some special tool to get inbetween the keys. One such homemade special tool could be a plastic/butter knife with cloth wrapped tightly around it. This should allow for cleaning of most spaces between keys. Clean for a few minutes, before shifting/moving the cloth (or wringing the cloth).If needed you could use some electronic cleaner, rubbing alcohol, all purpose cleaner or dishwasher in order to get the really dirty parts clean.
How to get rid of mosquitoes without electricity?
Similar to @britanist's answer, I recommend this one. This shape and design helps you set this net by tying corners to distant objects using threads or ropes. It's more convenient. Caution : Take care that no mosquito gets in while you are putting this net on. Else, you'll not be able to sleep even if there is electricity. :pOne nice way of doing that would be to place the mosquito net on the bed, wrapped. THen take each corner and tie it firmly to something. Make sure that no edge of the net loses contact with bed. Then, go inside and tuck it in. This particular image is just an example. No recommendations for this particular product from this website or howsoever. I, personally, have used them for years without fail. Purchased one from local shops nearby.
How to clean a keyboard without a vacuum cleaner
It is actually ok to wash your keyboard in the dishwasher. I would put it on the top rack. I would only be wary of doing this if your keyboard is unusually flimsy or fragile. After the wash leave it out on a towel for a couple of days, at least 2, to make sure it is completely dry before use. For a more thorough clean remove the keys first, though this may not be easy and I don't think it is necessary. Edit: if the keyboard is just dusty and the dust isn't sticking to the keys, compressed air is easy to use and quick, you can buy cans of it at the store or use your own air compressor.  It doesn't need to be powerful, just concentrated air flow.

Why don't you put one cloth (little bit thick just like towel) flat on your table and then put your keyboard on it. If it works then great but if it wobble again then fold cloth from that end where it is wobbling and then you will get leveled keyboard easily and you can adjust by your own.This is the only simple way to stop keyboard wobbling. Here is the image which are kept just at front edge of keyboard.
Stop keyboard wobble due to uneven desk
A simple solution would be to place a shim of the correct height under the keyboard. Because the keyboard won't always be in exactly the same place, you need to be able to adjust the height of the shim. Something like sticky tack is a good solution. If you place the sticky tack under the battery holder, it won't be visible when you're using the keyboard. 
How to remove nail polish from nails?
Soak fingertips in warm water for at least 15 mins+ then scrub nails with an abrasive, but not to abrasive, cloth to remove all traces of nail polish
Stop keyboard wobble due to uneven desk
This is happening because there is a gap of space between a corner of your keyboard and the desk.Your goal, as you may have guessed, is to remove this gap.A general solution is to look around you and find a material that can do this. Look around you for something with the following qualities:Small.As thick as the gap.Solid at room temperature, occupying a region of the known universe's three spacial dimensions. Ideally low enough density that its mass does not exert a significant gravitational pull on surrounding objects.Non-toxic through skin contact. Non-toxic to any pets you may have.Stable (non-radioactive), inert (non-reactive, at least with your desk, keyboard, and air), and either non-magnetic or possessing a magnetic field with an intensity low enough to not damage nearby sensitive objects.Composed of little or no saccharides (sugars), proteins, and/or lipids (fats), which may attract ants (relevant to me, at least), roaches, or other pests. (Example: Do not affix a small piece of meat to your keyboard with honey.)Sometimes you may look around you and find something that is the appropriate thickness but perhaps too large. If you find materials like this, look for one that you can cut with a tool. Examples of tools that cut things are:Scissors.Knives.Generally anything harder than the material you wish to cut with a wedge-shaped edge that can be driven into the material to separate it.Some materials can even be torn by hand.Another option is something larger but soft, so that it can deform to an even surface. Many such things exist. Things like mouse pads, placemats, pieces of random soft material that you may have laying around or see online. Using imagination and your lifetime's worth of experience with physics, you should be able to find such a material.Once you find this material, insert it into the gap or under the keyboard."But wait!" you say, "Every time I move my keyboard, the material slips out!" Well, as you may have noticed throughout your life, the problem of preventing one thing from moving relative to another thing has many established solutions. Your goal is to find some sort of material or compound that will allow your chosen gap filler to remain in place relative to the desk or keyboard. For inspiration, your local dollar store's school supply section or local hardware store's adhesive section may be of use.Some materials may not even need to be cut, and may fit all of the above requirements. For example, using my power of logical thinking, and remembering things that I have seen before, I am able to recall that these are possible options. Perhaps you have some laying around that you haven't used. Of course, the "best" (that is, it'll really solve the issue) option is to level your desk, for which tools such as hand planes exist (if you find the video unsatisfying, there are others in the related video list), as leveling uneven wood is also a problem with well-established solutions. If the desk already has a finish, though, you'd have to refinish it. Still, a job well done can be fun and satisfying.Alternatively, if you purchased the desk new, and it is warped, consider exchanging it for one that is not warped.
Stop keyboard wobble due to uneven desk
Sorry if this is making your OCD worse, but I think the problem is that your table is standing imbalanced. You should first attack that.The keyboard is in itself well balanced, so any solution you find for the current position on the table will probably not work 20-30 cm to the left or the right or when you move the keyboard to the middle of the table to put a book or piece of paper in front of you.In your screenshot you either have to lift the front left leg or the back right one to make it even again, use some marbles or a water level to find out which one. On most phones there is an app, that if you calibrate it right works pretty good. It might also happen that you need to adjust 3 of the 4 table legs.It could also be the floor that's wrong, so any solution you find for the table ... :)
Stop keyboard wobble due to uneven desk
Get a long stick (longer than the diagonal of the KB) and half the thickness of the gap. Place it diagonally under the KB. Have it fitted with magnets, so it can stay with the KB, which you might have to attach two metal pieces to somehow. Everything can be painted in an OCD pleasing colour.
Stop keyboard wobble due to uneven desk
I realize that the question states "I'd like to keep the solution's visibility minimal" as one of the goals, and plenty of other answers have suggestions for modifying the keyboard, but I'm going to make a case here for instead modifying the desk, while focusing on the solution being visible-but-attractive, rather than invisible.Using a keyboard on an uneven surface is just unpleasant, all of the shimming and bracing in the world can't change that, and those solutions tend to become further annoyances over time. Shims slip, keyboards shift, etc.Much better to give the desk a flat, level surface, on which to set the keyboard. You can get quarter-inch steel plate from plenty of places (probably even Home Depot) for not very much money. (12" x 18" is a standard-ish size, and runs around $20-$25 US. That would be more than enough space for the Apple wireless keyboard. You could probably even get away with 6" x 18", since it won't really need to move front-to-back much.)Get a nice, clean, flat quarter-inch steel plate, set it on the desk as the "keyboard tray", and use some rubber feet or similar to make sure the plate sits flat and level. It's not likely to bend, and it's not going anywhere. (If you want to be really sure and don't mind gluing to the desk surface, some Liquid Nails should hold it.)Your keyboard should now sit perfectly stable, and the plate's only 1/4" thick so you won't even notice it when typing.That's what I'd do, if this was the desk I'd be using my computer on every single day.You could also do the same thing with a sheet of glass, but it'd have to be thicker and it's harder to hide anything placed underneath to level it. (Unless you wanted to get a glass top cut to fit the entire desk, which would be an expensive but attractive way to get a really flat surface.)
How to dust Venetian blinds?
In my case I have such blinds on a balcony looking over a big boulevard so they get dirty quite fast. The way I clean them is the following - I take down the blinds when fully extended and closed . After that I take them to the bathroom and I use my shower.  My shower is with flexible hose like  so that helps.  Now after you pour some water to the blinds they stick to either the floor or the walls.  In case the blinds are short enough I use the wall otherwise I use the floor. Use strong flow of water and hit the blinds from one side to the other.  The dust literally flows out.  You may have to use some towel if the blinds are really dusty or muddy. Cleaning the blinds using this approach is much easier but it is still a challenge for my apartment as I have about 20.NOTE: remember to remove the plastic part for turning the blinds otherwise it will constantly get in you way. Now I also remove the small plastic part at the end of the strap for lifting the blinds(after I stepped on a few and broke them :)

Is there any way to speed up the computer startup?
Yes, and all the techniques fall into one of two categories.Make the computer faster.Make the computer do less to start up.Buying a SSD is the best way to make the computer get the information it is loading from disk, if you are starting up from a rotating hard drive.  Increasing system RAM is the best way to prevent the computer saving less-accessed RAM back to disk; but typically provides little or not benefits if you have "enough" RAM.Finding and removing unnecessary software that launch at start time, and turning off features and services that launch at start is the best way to make the computer do less.There are limits to both approaches.  The first approach eventually becomes too expensive to pursue after some amount of initial cost.  The latter approach eventually launches too little to make the computer useful.  Like all things, some amount of 
Tricks for opening very tight jars
This only works with metal lids on glass jars!Have no idea how this works but it has every time and its an old solution my grandmother passed down. Tap the lid with the handle of a knife or some such implement a few times in various positions around the side of the lid [not the top]... and you should be able to open with relative ease from there.If the above does not release the lid, place the lid under a hot water running from a tap... try to keep the glass bottle out of the water - so tip the jar over so that the water is running predominantly on the metal lid. While the lid is still hot, place a tea towel or the like over the lid so you don't burn yourself and twist.Good luck!
How to light a match?
Preparation is key.  Don't go into the woods unprepared.  Matches are not the only answer, but if you can't build a fire without them, then look for "strike anywhere" matches.  They still make them, but they are getting harder to find.  Other matches require some heat and the "missing" safety ingredient embedded in the strike paper.To prepare for camping, once you learn how to collect wood and build a fire from a modest coal, you can then move on to charwood, which is an easy way to start a fire (provided the other fire making skills are known).To make charwood (or charred punkwood) use an Altoid tin with a few holes in it.  Burn the punkwood in the air constrained confines of the Altoid tin, making a type of highly flammable charcoal.  The tin also provides an easy carrying case and keeps the wood dry.Then the next time you need a fire, light with a spark from a scraping based fire starter (or other means of generating sparks), and the charcoal will light and smolder, then give it a few good blows to get it really going and dump it into your small tinder.If you run out, you can use the fire you just made to make more.Of all the fire starting methods I've used in various camping scenarios, this is by far the easiest.  In fact, for me it is easier than matches, which seem to always require two or three as they sometimes die out before drying the small tinder enough to light.   See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_FZ01NvDGo for a demonstration of making the charcoal and lighting it.  He managed to light it on the first spark.  He's lighting it with a ferrocerium rod, which if purchasing, get the biggest one you can, as bigger is much easier to use.  I recommend something like http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S6F4RDC?psc=1  To strike, I use my knife.Keep in mind that punkwood is not a specific type of tree, rather it is the high air content loose wood that is typically found in the interior of rotting sticks.  On your next camping trip you can easily collect enough to start a dozen fires, or collect some in your neighborhood, make the charwood and then go camping.And for those of you asking, but what if you don't have a knife?  My answer is, "don't go camping"  If you lack a respectable knife, you have seriously tilted the odds against you in a camping trip.  By respectable, I don't mean a Rambo knife, but a four inch blade high quality folding pocket knife.  If possible, go with a tanto point as they are less likely to break.  If you have the means, I've been especially fond of my Carson Knives CRKT M16. http://www.crkt.com/M1602Z
Is there any way to speed up the computer startup?
You have a variety of choices depending on your time, budget, and tech-fu:Replace your hard drive with an SSD will certainly be a big win.  Your laptop will boot faster and apps will open faster and it is quieter and uses less power.  This also brings other side benefits I will mention later.Adding more RAM will be a decent win.  Things will generally go faster, and you will be able to do more things at once before your laptop slows down.  This is easier than replacing your hard drive, but it won't have nearly the same effect.While it is more true with Windows than MacOS, you will still get some help from merely reinstalling the OS.  Reinstalling will clean our a certain amount of BS that accumulates as software is installed and updated.Uninstall apps you no longer need or use.Review startup settings.  Even after you've installed something maybe you don't want it to start on its own.  VPNs and software updaters are necessary, but you may not want them so much that it slows down your startup time.I would avoid software that claims to speed your computer up for you.  Some of it may be helpful, but most of it is a waste of money.
Automate downloads which could be interrupted by VPN/ Download failures
Since you have to download large files over and over again it might be worth it to have a personal server or VM somewhere else that you download the files to and then rsync the files from your server to your desktop.  The advantage of this is that the downloads to your personal server are less likely to be interrupted because they should continue whether you have local Internet connectivity or not.  Then rsync will only download what hasn't been downloaded already so you won't have to start over on a 2GB file.
How to disinfect inside of shower and water tap outside your home so you don't get sick?
Maybe I just haven't been in fancy enough hotels, but I've never seen one with the type of shower head that has a hose attached. On the off-chance that a guest actually removed the shower head specifically so they could attach a hose, it would be their own hose and only the hose end would uh.. make contact.But to answer your question, I've seen a suggested method of disinfecting a faucet or shower head using white vinegar or alcohol, a small plastic bag (like sandwich size or similar), and a rubber band.Pour vinegar/alcohol into the bag.Wrap the bag around the shower head.Secure it with the rubber band.You may have to adjust the amount of liquid so that it makes full contact with the exposed areas of the shower head.
Is there any way to speed up the computer startup?
This question in fact has an “outside-the-box” solution: the best way to speed up the computer at startup is to not make it start up at all. Make it hibernate instead. You get the benefits of turning the computer off (it doesn't consume any power while it's off) without the downsides (it starts back up quickly and with all your applications open).See your operating system's documentation for how to hibernate. On OSX, apparently, this isn't part of the default user interface but can be performed on the command line or via a third-party widget.
Automate downloads which could be interrupted by VPN/ Download failures
You need a download manager: a program (usually linked to your web browser) that can resume a download if it's interrupted. For Firefox there's DownThemAll, for example.

How can I relieve the itchiness from a mosquito bite?
I have found that heating a metal teaspoon and pressing it against the bite provides almost instant and permanent relief from the itching (the redness and 'bump' will remain while the wound heals).Heat a teaspoon by pouring some hot water over the spoon side.I use boiling water from a kettle (which is WAY too hot) but allow it to cool down for several seconds testing the temperature regularly. Let the teaspoon cool to a tolerable temperature then press it firmly against the bite and hold it there for 5-10 seconds. The teaspoon should be hot enough to cause a slight stinging feeling on the skin but only for a split second; It should be as hot as you can stand it without burning you. If you are using boiling water, like me - be very careful not to burn yourself!From what I gather, It's not too clear what exactly causes the itching sensation; It's either the mosquitoes saliva or the histamines that the body creates to deal with this foreign intrusion. It is my understanding that the heat from the teaspoon inhibits the effectiveness/activity of both the enzymes in the mosquito saliva (Denaturation) and the bodies histamines.
How can I relieve the itchiness from a mosquito bite?
Before doing anything you must clean the bite area with plain water or rubbing alcohol.Before starting I would like to say that as there is a huge discussion related to this topic so I'll stick to some simple solutions. If you need more then try this link:Here - (as it got vast explanation)1. Scotch tape:Putting Scotch tape (or a bandage) on the bite will help remind you not to scratch, especially at night. If you scratch too hard, you could break the skin and introduce an infection.2. Aloe veraAloe vera has anti-inflammatory properties, so this could help the itch3. Listerine (Mouth Wash)It has menthol, which cools the skin to help relieve itch.4. Hand SanitizerIt also works well as it can help you from itchiness.5. IceUsing ice for 10 - 20 minutes can help you and give relaxation.6.Toothpaste7. You can also use Honey.But still avoid doing this as it can attract more insects.8. ClothIf you really got nothing means really nothing then simply take one cloth and blow some air on your cloth to make it little bit warm and then gently apply to your bite area. There you can feel little bit relax and keep doing it for 4 - 5 times till it makes you feel good.
Stop keyboard wobble due to uneven desk
That gap isn't very large.  You can twist your keyboard by hand in small increments to fit the surface of your table. The keyboard may appear fairly stiff, but it will conform to the table with some effort.A better course of action, though, is to get a Bench Plane and simply flatten the surface of the table, at least around the keyboard area.  Shouldn't take too long.
How can I relieve the itchiness from a mosquito bite?
Mosquito bites itch because your body is trying to destroy the foreign materil, i.e. the mosquito saliva.  You need a quick way to draw it out to stop the itch.  I have never tried it with a mosquito bite, but if you lick a Tums/Rolaid (I mean really wet it down) and stick it to a bee/wasp sting, the paste that it will make will draw the venom out of the sting as it drys.  I would imagine it would work the same for a mosquito bite, drawing the saliva out of the bite.
How can I relieve the itchiness from a mosquito bite?
A mosquito uses a blood thinning agent to have an easier time being a parasite.  This agent is foreign to our bodies, and we create histamines to surround them.  Histamines are itchy.I get mosquito bites often, so I'm not as allergic add most people.  However, for more serious bites, I use my fingernail to make an "X" on the bite.This is not something I came up with, but I believe it works.  I believe the idea is that making this "X" spreads the histamine out, so it isn't as itchy.  At least, it spreads the itch out, so it isn't as noticeable.  I go a couple steps further, basically just using my fingernail to break up the bite as much as possible.  Note that I'm not breaking skin here.There are plenty of anti-histamines on the market, and I generally recommend a Benadryl cream.  This will also sooth poison ivy, which is something you might come across wherever you happen to be getting mosquito bites.
What can I do when the upholstry on my computer chair is coming off?
You could buy or make your own slipcover for computer chair, and focus on getting a kind which either is in two parts with one part for the back, and one for the seat, or a "one-piece" which slips on the back and extends forward over the seat.The last one can also be hacked using a long blanket. Put the blanket over the seat, up the back and over the top of back. Fasten it together so that the topmost part of the blanket forms a pocket over the back of the chair. To fasten you can either stitch it together, use some safety pins, or if your in a real pinch staple it together.It can also be an advantage to tie a thin rope (or similar) around the back in the area between the seat and the back of chair to keep the extra fabric close to the back, and prevent it from slipping forward.If the chair is clearly divided in a back rest and seat part, you can instead of one piece of fabric use two parts possibly with a sewn elastic to kind of make "fitted sheets" for each part.
How can I relieve the itchiness from a mosquito bite?
Open the freezer, find a bag of something that conforms to the bite area (frozen peas are awesome) apply this to the bite area.  The itching should stop immediately.  Remove the peas and place them back in the freezer.The only downside is that you shouldn't overdo the contact time.
Tricks for opening very tight jars
I bought a bunch of circular non slip rubber pads in a UK supermarket, since then I haven't had to use any other trick.Make sure the lid and the jar are dry. Cover the lid with the pad, tightly grab the jar with your weaker hand (use a cotton cloth if needed) and then just twist the lid with your strong hand through the rubber pad. The lid will be released effortlessly.I see they sell these pads online, if you can't find them locally, and they are worth every cent they cost.

Cable organisation when travelling
You mentioned using clear plastic bags for your cables.  I've been doing this for years.  I use one cable per bag, to prevent tangling. (It works even better if you leave the ends sticking out of the mostly-zipped-up bag). Then I either write on the bag what the cable is, with a thick, black, permanent marker, or I slap a rectangle of silver duct tape on the plastic bag and write the cable's description on that.I made a video about this a few years ago.
How to get hair out of a brush
Chances are you have a comb, right?Hold the brush in one hand and the comb in the other. Put the comb at the end of the brush that is furthest from you and wiggle it right down to the ends of the bristles where they meet the back of the brush. Now pull the comb towards you (along the length of the brush) gathering the mat of hair out of the bristles as you go. Eventually the comb pops out of the bristles at the end closest to you, with the hair all in front of it. Pull the hair off the comb with your fingers and throw it away.Takes less time to do than to read.

How to get a drenched currency note dry?
I assume you mean any artificial heat when you say "electricity". The best way of drying absorbent items without using any artificial heat is to either use diffusion/heat from the air by hanging the notes to dry like you would a sheet, or placing it against your skin and use your body heat. I suspect the former method is the most effective (and comfortable!) unless you're someplace very cold and/or humid.

How to avoid/stop pressurised ballpoint pen leaking?
I don't know how hack-y this is, but leaking is not a normal part of the wear and tear of this pen; it is a manufacturer's defect. You should send it back to the manufacture. Fisher Space Pens are warrantied against any malfunction basically forever.Fisher Space Pen > Repair or ReplacementThe operating temperature is from −30 to 250 °F (−35 to 120 °C), so your not even close to being out of spec. The ink is forced out by compressed nitrogen at a pressure of nearly 35 psi (240 kPa), so I don't think any home repair or kludgey workaround is going to work with this pen specifically.

How can I get a mouse out the house without causing it any harm?
There is a simple trap you can make with:empty paper towel / toilet paper rolltrash canpeanut butterInstructions:Put a small dab of peanut butter on the inside of the roll on one end.Place the roll so that the end with the peanut butter is hanging over a counter (balanced over the edge)Place the trash can underneath the open edge of the roll.You may need to glue a small weight on the end of the roll depending on how short or long it is to act as a counter balance.The idea is that the mouse will smell the peanut butter and try to reach it through the roll. It has enough balance to stay by itself, but once the mouse reaches over the edge, it and the roll will fall into the trash can.Leave this out overnight to allow ample time for said mouse to find the trap, and collect in the morning.Here is an example.

How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?
I would suggest using a mosquito net. If a mosquito (if it's slim) find its way into your net then you can easily corner and punish it.
How to get a drenched currency note dry?
Take a cardboard box; some aluminum foil; some black paper, black plastic or flat black paint (gloss and semi-gloss are not as good, but will work) and a roll of plastic wrap. Cut the flaps off of the box and use them to build a single or multi-faceted (the latter being better) reflector panel by arranging them above the inside of the box such that they would bounce light they catch inward. Cut one side of the box down to about 25% of its original height. You can use this piece to make the reflector even bigger too! Now, either paint the inside of the remainder of the box black or line it with either the black paper or black plastic. Cut a hole maybe 1"-2" in diameter near the top of one of the remaining sides to allow the moist, hot air to escape. Place the wet money inside the box pretty much anywhere, you can even attach it to the sides via any method you like if you want to have more exposed surface area to the hot air. FINALLY, seal the top of the box shut with the plastic wrap and set your reflector atop the box and aim the low side of the box at the sun. You can also heat up some lunch or dinner in here as well as solar ovens can get quite hot!The best part? This is reusable and as mentioned, can cook food too!Some other, ummm less "inspired" yet absolutely valid ideas... ;)You could hang it on a clothesline out in the sun as well. But you'd have to watch it closely of course.Clothespin the bill(s) to a stick and ride around on your bicycle, motorcycle or hang out of the car window while driving about (low speed is important here!)Crank the car AC and use binder clips to hold the narrow end(s) to the vent. I think this still pretty much qualifies for the no-electricity based products since all power whether mechanical or electric is provided by the engine and is thusly self-contained.Duct tape the edges to your shirt and run in circles, stand in a windy area, if living in a big city with a subway system, stand over one of the ventilation gratings which blast out large volumes of air as the trains pass beneath.
How to get a drenched currency note dry?
On a flat table, place a paper towel or facial tissue, then the bill, then another paper towel or facial tissue. Press down hard on the top paper towel or tissue, across the entire surface of the bill.Replace both paper towels with a new, dry one.  Press down again.Do this about 5 times and you'll have a dry (or 95% dry) bill.  Should take less than 2 minutes.
How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?
Now that's something which you can use to kill 1 mosquito. Just simply target it and use this racket and that's too in the middle of the night. Its not the only option but its just my recommendation:Mosquito Killing RacketWhy to use this:Just because it is re-chargeable you can first charge it and keep it beside you and whenever you find any mosquito you can target it and kill this with this racket.You can use it by pressing that red button. While pressing it there will be some electric charges come at those nets and when any mosquito come in contact with those net it dies at that moment. Since there is one more layer of net to protect you from getting any damage from that and its also not that much risky. If by accident you touch it, it will give you just a little shock but its good to take precautions.Since you said you have to kill it and so I recommend you this.

How to remove dust particles when it accidentally goes into our eyes?
Hold your head on its side and wash with water.Your tear ducts are at the side of the eye, by your nose.  With your head tilted the tears flow across the eye taking the dust to the corner.  Particles are more easily removed from the eye's corner than if they just go under your lower eyelid.Sprinkling water on your eye helps wash the particles to the corner.Try not to blink too much while you're doing it.  That reduces the risk of scratching the sclera.If you have the dust in both eyes, do one at a time.  Washing away from the nose.
Using electricity at night
All kinds of devices can be run overnight such as washing machines, dish washers, tumble dryers, etc...There are also available, if you have electric heating, devices called night storage heaters which are electric radiators which generate and store heat using cheaper electricity at night and can then release this heat during the day.Obvious other options would be things such as electric cars.  The new Golf GTE plug in hybrid for example takes four hours to recharge.  This would obviously be cheaper done overnight to be ready for the following day.  The same is probably true of any rechargeable device from simple things like phones and laptops to less obvious things such as shavers and tooth brushes.As previously stated, plug timers offer a great way to tap into this cheap electricity even with devices which do not offer a delay function.Final suggestion; electric bread maker.  This could be set to run overnight so you would wake up to freshly baked warm bread for breakfast.
Using electricity at night
This kind of tariff for electricity is common in France. I think the main thing that people run at night is electric water heaters, the kind that store enough hot water for the day. The electricity supply carries a signal indicating the beginning and the end of the night rate and this drives a relay which switches the heater on and off.If you don't have an electric water heater or if it operates on demand, you may not get much benefit from a night rate. The main electricity-hungry household appliances are washing machines, driers and dishwashers; you may want to run them at night if they aren't too noisy.
How can I get single portion size amount of sprouts per day, with minimum attention?
If you take a jam jar and fill it with enough seeds for 2-3 days, you can then rinse them thoroughly in water and drain it. The next day you can rinse it again and turn the jar upside down over damp kitchen paper. 1-2 days later you should have your sprouts.You can then stagger this with another 2 jars so that you keep around a weeks supply.
How to keep bread fresher for longer
How to Increase a Bread's Shelf LifeFor those who live alone, you're probably familiar how often food can go to waste if not properly stored. However, it's also impractical to buy single portions of the most perishable foods, such as vegetables, fruits, breads, and dairy products. That's why we're going to discuss one of these perishable items, and teach you ways on how you can lengthen its shelf life.Here's how to keep bread fresher for longer period of time.Which Is Better: Room Temperature or the Fridge?Contrary to popular belief, throwing bread inside the fridge is a wrong move. Although the coolness of the fridge can keep certain food fresh, it's a different story for bread. Doing so will cause moisture, causing the bread to go stale sooner.Furthermore, putting bread inside the fridge is similar to leaving it at room temperature for 3 days. So, the best move would be, store a loaf of bread in an airtight container. Although, some people do recommend the use of linen bags, because they can be tightly closed.Consider the Type of BreadKeep in mind, not all breads have the same shelf life. For instance, French bread goes stale in just a matter of hours. Likewise, crusty bread is only good for a day, that's why it'll be a wrong move to buy one and keep it for days.How to Handle Freshly-Baked BreadIf you're planning to place a freshly-baked bread inside a plastic bag, you should wait for it to cool down first. The warmth of bread will make it soggy if you store it right away.Freezing BreadsYou can store your bread even after its “best before” date by putting them inside the freezer. Believe it or not, it can last for up to 3 months, if stored properly. Here's how you should do it:Step 1: Slice the Loaf of BreadIf you're going to store a loaf of bread, it's best to slice it first. That way, you don't need to slice it anymore during the reheating process-- this can be really difficult.Step 2: Wrap the BreadYou can either use aluminum foil or plastic to wrap your bread. It'll trap the bread's moisture and prevent it from getting dry and hard. Likewise, using plastic bags can help in avoiding freezer burn.Step 3: The Reheating ProcessingWhen you're ready to use the bread, allow it to thaw at room temperature. Then, remove the freezer wrapping and place it inside a preheated oven.Additional RemindersFor unsliced Artisanal bread, leave it unwrapped with the cut sideface-down. This technique will help in keeping the crispiness of thebread's crust. On the other hand, if exposed to the air, it'll gostale in just a matter of hours.Reheating should only be done once to restore its crisp. After that,you'll just reheating stale bread.Wrapped bread should be stored in its original packaging, tightlysealed with a twist tie or knot. If stored this way, it can last for3-5 days at room temperature.There you have it. These are some of the most effective ways on how you can retain the freshness of the bread.

How to get cat urine smell out of wooden floors?
The best thing I have found is soaking the floor/ carpet with vinegar then sprinkle baking soda over it and after a few min pour some vinegar over it. It does bubble up and when that stops scrub it down. Sometimes I'll use more vinegar and then water sometimes just vinegar. This seems to really get the smell out.
How can I stop cat hair getting onto my bathroom towels?
You were part of the way there with keeping your towel in your bedroom.  If this worked well but the only issue was that you didn't have a towel to dry your hands, consider buying some disposable paper hand towels of the kind you may find in a public rest room to use to dry your hands when your towel is in your bedroom.A possible alternative would be to hang your towel on a coat hanger which was then covered with an inverted carrier bag with a small hole for the hook.  This would effectively cover your towel up but still give you access from the bottom of the bag to dry your hands.  The only drawback with this solution is that the towel, once wet, wouldn't dry well so would need laundered more frequently.
How can I stop cat hair getting onto my bathroom towels?
Assuming you have a shower, rather than just a bathtub, you might be able to put a hook for your towel inside your shower itself.  Most of the day & night, you could keep your towel on that hook, not touching any walls or wet surfaces, safely protected behind your shower curtain or shower door.  When you needed to take a shower, you could take the towel out and hang it in the bathroom on a hook or bar (once you made sure the hook/bar didn't have cat hair on it).
How to get cat urine smell out of wooden floors?
Chlorine bleach worked for me in a similar situation, as long as it can soak in to the wood as deep as the urine has.  Dilute about 5:1 with water, and be sure to ventilate the place and not spend much time inside until the chlorine smell has gone away.  You can actually see the bleach work on areas where the urine is concentrated, as it will bubble...Re "You can't use Chlorine with cat urine as cat urine has a lot of ammonia. Combining chlorine and ammonia makes a very dangerous and poisonous gas!"Naturally you should do this (or anything involving chlorine bleach) in a well-ventilated area, but the fact that I did it (on quite a bit of cat urine, too - I don't think the previous owner of this house had a sense of smell :-(), and am alive and healthy 15 years later, suggests that "very dangerous" is something of an exaggeration.
Stop keyboard wobble due to uneven desk
If you slowly begin turning your keyboard on its vertical axis, it will come to a stable resting point before you've made a quarter turn.Perhaps not the most convenient for use, but it fits the criteria of your question ;) And who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and only need to turn it a few degrees.Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuF-WB7mD6kScientific paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0510065v6.pdf
How can I remove the cork from a wine bottle when I don't have a corkscrew?
I can personally attest to the key method working. However, it does work much better if you use two keys. You insert each key at the angle shown in James Webster's diagram, but you turn the keys 90deg from the position shown prior to inserting them so that the second key is not prevented from going very far in by the first. Then simply twist the keys around inside of the neck of the bottle as you pull and it will make the removal quite a bit easier in terms of effort. You get a second advantage from this method besides just the obvious one of having the keys angled across from each other giving a better hold inside of the cork though. That advantage is that now the keys are at a MUCH better angle to hold on to while attempting to extricate the cork and is also quite conducive to mentioned rotation of the cork as you lift without hurting your fingers from the pressure on the thin edge of the key(s.)Another method which is fairly effective is to take a thin flexible blade such as a boning knife (or really, any thin and flexible but strong strip of material, be it metal or plastic)  and work it in between the cork and the bottle. You can then use the combination of the compression of the cork from the side with the small gap letting air in as you remove the cork to release the cork from its home inside of the neck of the bottle. This will work even better with two such strips, in fact, there is a type of coke remove that uses this very principle with two such strips of spring steel.
How can I remove the cork from a wine bottle when I don't have a corkscrew?
Push it in with your index finger (yeah, press hard!). You need to keep your little finger in the bottle neck to pour the first glass to stop the cork bunging up the hole.

How can I extend the life of steel wool used for cleaning?
One way of extending the lifespan of steel wool is to put it in a ziplock bag and then put it inside the freezer.  The ziplock bag reduces the oxygen it is exposed and prevents it from touching anything else in the freezer, while the freezer's low temperature reduces the rate at which it oxidizes further.  Whenever you need to use it, just take it out of the freezer and the bag, clean it a bit after using it, and then put it back in the bag and in the freezer.
How can I extend the life of steel wool used for cleaning?
I've never tried this, but you could dry it thoroughly with a blow dryer before you put it again. That should remove all the water from it and limit or prevent rusting.

How to store bananas and keep fruit flies away?
Drape mosquito netting over them, or use some similar fine mesh. That allows air to flow and (if the holes are small enough) will prevent fruit flies from landing on them. Just make sure to "tent" the mesh/netting so that it's not directly touching the bananas; if it's touching the netting, I'd be worried about fruit flies somehow reaching through the holes in the netting and nibbling at the bananas' peels (or laying eggs or whatever they do).
How do I eat from a bowl without needing to clean it?
To eat from a bowl without needing to clean it (regardless if it is dirty or not) simply get a plastic bag and use it as a lining to the bowl. After eating, simply take the bag out and throw it away.You'd need to make sure the bag is big enough to line the entire inside of the bowl. If you don't you can cause the food, if a liquid, to spill over the bag and dirtying the bowl (if it isn't already dirty). Failing this you can just add less to the bowl but a bigger bag is the preferred choice. If you have a particular large bag, a couple of cups can be used to weigh down the ends.This same method can be used with plates as well, however one should take care when using knives in these situations to avoid cutting the plastic up. This allows holes that juice/sauce seeps through but more dangerously you may accidentally eat the plastic. This method is better suited for bowls with food you do not need to cut.
How do I eat from a bowl without needing to clean it?
The premises of this question is a bit on the far side, as I don't live in a country where the water-main doesn't drop out very often, and even though the temperature in the winter often drops into the freezing temperature the water is still not that cold.However I would advise against using plastic bags for this purpose as suggested in another answer, unless they are recycled (which kind of goes against the general principle of the other answer).My take on a solution assuming the water being cut off for shorter periods of time, would be to wipe clean the bowl with a paper towel, or possible use disposable plates during the repair period. If multiple persons in your household, you could have one plate each.Depending on what you eat, and how dirty the plates get, you could wipe clean the plates quite a few times before it is unhealthy to eat from. If they get to dirty, then replace with a new clean plate every so often. This should help you get by until the water-main is fixed.
How can I prevent leaves from blocking my gutter guard?
My gutter guards are half-tubes of plastic-coated wire mesh. C-shaped if you like. They are placed in the gutter with the curve upward, filling the space between gutter and roof edge.So the leaves don't get caught, they blow or get washed right over the edge. These work really well. I have not needed to clean the gutters since I got them.
How do I eat from a bowl without needing to clean it?
Eat nothing but dry cereal. The few crumbs left behind can just be wiped out. You could put the bowl in the refrigerator. The lower temperatures would inhibit bacteria growth. Or if it is a metal bowl, light a fire in it. Most organic compounds breakdown before you hit 900 deg F leaving just ash, which wipes out easily. (Do Not do this to teflon, it both destroys the teflon and can make you sick)

Where should a fan be aimed for maximum cooling of a room with one opening?
What is the science behind it?Both airflow directions will be able to exchange the same volume of air. The fan will not produce a vaccuum, because there will be a flow in the opposite direction. This opposed air flow will be more turbulent. Keep simple physics in mind:Don't disturb the air flow of the fan - especially at it's back. The air will be soaked in.Hot air rises. To push hot air out of a room, it may help to place the fan on an elevated level. Outside of the room may be outdoors. The arrangement of air layers is not always like in a closed room. Then an airflow aimed inwards may produce different results.This diminishes the general usefullness of this direction.To answer the question: Just maximize the air flow, by not blocking it. The direction will not influence the volume of exchanged air. However try to blow the warm air at the top of the room out.To improve the usage of a ventilatorMost benefitial for cooling is evaporation. This physics effect is based on needed energy to overcome "latent heat". Just remeber the chill when rising out of a lake after swimming at windy weather. The water droplets on your skin have the temperature of the sea. Then they evaporate and cool your skin. A bowl of water before the fan will not help much. However just wetten your skin - maybe use a wet towel or blanket during sleep.In addition to optimizing the air flow of the ventilator, there are amazing tricks for hot summer nights:an ice pack in the air stream of the ventilator chills the aircool water in a hot water bottle
How do I make a very strong magnifying glass?
It sounds like what you want is something to concentrate light, not necessarily magnify anything.For the former, you can simply use multiple mirrors. You can use normal flat mirrors (for example, by having a bunch of pairs of mirrors that all reflect incident sunlight toward a specific point), but focusing light is easier if you also have convex mirrors (with focal points of one or more meters).I won't give you a design, because there are a literally infinite number that'd work well, and because you'd need a diagram to implement it (and I'm terrible at diagrams). But this is the general principle.
How can I extend the life of steel wool used for cleaning?
After shaking as much water as possible, you could bathe them in some strong alcohol like methylated spirits or isopropanol. In theory this should make them dry of water and the alcohol would evaporate quickly. If you keep the alcohol in a sealed container, it should be usable many time although it would become diluted very very gradually.
What sort of adhesive should I use to run a wire along my car's plastic trim?
Depending on the car, you may be able to slide the wire behind the edge of the roof and pillar trim.   If that's not possible, I'd wedge the wire in the corner between the trim and the windshield. Then place a narrow strip of gaffer tape over the wire. Gaffer tape offers good adhesion and is designed to be removable without leaving a residue. You'll have to replace the tape 1-2 times a year because over time it will degrade. If you want to use glue, the type of glue depends on the trim materials. On many cars, the trim is covered in fabric, which makes it difficult to use glue on and not leave a mess. If the trim is hard plastic, the glue you need depends on the type of plastic. Cyanoacrylate glue often works reasonably well. 
How to bend chipboard into a cylinder without tearing it apart?
If you mist the cardboard with water and let it get a little damp, you should be able to bend it without it breaking apart. Once you have your cylinder formed, let it dry out. Exact time required and amount of water might be a bit tricky as not all cardboard will behave the same way.
What is the best way to paint a windshield wiper arm?
My initial thought is to use black spray paint, and apply it to disconnected wipers. If not possible to disconnect easily (or with tools you have), you could opt for doing a sort of opposite chrome wrapping as seen when they paint cars. That is, cover the hood/trunk and possibly windshield with paper so that only the wipers are accessible. Spray away from windshield when applying paint.Another alternative, going down the hackish way, would be to apply either nail paint (or acrylic paint for metal) to the wipers. Would take some time, but should be easily done with a little patience.If you have the option try going for matte/flat colors, to help reduce reflections.

Make a hacksaw blade suitable for use with food
No, the hacksaw you pick up at your local hardware store is not food grade no matter how much you clean or scrape. If you are concerned about food safety, you don't know what materials are used in their construction or what the blade, paint, lubricants, frame, and other workings might have been treated with.They make butcher saws with stainless steel blades specifically designed to address your concerns. They might be called meat saws or bone saws, but the name will be suggestive of their intended purpose.Food-Grade Saws

How to store bananas and keep fruit flies away?
Peel the ripe bananas and store them in the freezer in a ziploc-type bag.It's then really easy to use them as and when you need them, especially if using them in smoothies.Ideally buy them ripe from the store so you can peel them immediately and don't have to leave them to ripen.As Alex says, putting them in the fridge should slow down the ripening process, so I guess you can even store the peeled bananas in the fridge too.
How to get sock marks off legs quickly
No hacky answer here I'm afraid - I know from experience (having the same trouble) that there isn't a way of removing those marks other than waiting for the body to do it naturally - depending how old you are, that can take a couple or three hours or overnight. What you could do, though, is buy different socks with a longer, slouchy top to allow for expansion, so when your legs swell as the day goes on, no marks from tight socks are showing. Alternatively, wear light or medium support tights beneath the trousers and put the socks on over the top on days when you know you'll be wanting to wear a dress or skirt later. Check, though, that the socks you're wearing aren't simply really tight at the top anyway - some are tighter than others.I did resort to cutting through the top band with a pair of scissors on tighter pairs, angling the cut towards the foot of the sock - but the sock then tends to disappear downwards, bunching up under your foot as the day goes on if you're wearing boots, not always, but often.
Hack for removing the last weight from a 7ft barbell?
You could set the whole thing next to a bench, then lift one end up over the bench.Pull off the weight that's above the bench.  The bar shouldn't fly up into the air because of the other weight falling to the floor, but be careful the first few times just in case.  Then pull the bar out of the weight that's on the floor.
How to get sock marks off legs quickly
I've not actually tested this, but I was told by a relative that you can make these sock marks disappear quicker by rubbing moisturiser on it - the same apparently works for when you get a pillow crease on your face when you wake up in the morning (although this is again untested by me - I have enough permanent creases that one temporary one doesn't matter...!)

Hack for removing the last weight from a 7ft barbell?
After some searching I found an instructional video that demonstrates an easy method for loading and unloading a barbell. Similar to BrettFromLA's answer by lifting the unloaded side straight up the weights on the loaded sided simply slide of and are stacked nicely on the ground.Step 1: Grab unloaded side of barbell with both hands and lift upwards.Step 2: Continue lifting the bar until it is in a vertical position.Step 3: Once bar is positioned vertically, stand atop the loaded side and pull the bar upwards.Step 4: Once barbell is released from weights replace it on the rack and rerack the plates.
Make a hacksaw blade suitable for use with food
I'd just go ahead and use any old industrial hack saw blade, and then if you are worried about contaminants, just cut off a thin slice adjacent to where the blade cut, once the meat is defrosted.    Keep it simple.  Of course, what I generally do is cut the meat into usable size portions and then freeze it --- but that won't work if your meat is already frozen.  I have occasionally put some in the microwave on a defrost cycle, and then when just a little bit defrosted, cut it, and refreeze the unneeded portion.  
What is the best way to paint a windshield wiper arm?
So just lift up the wiper and put newspaper under it, covering the windshield. Then just spray away with black acrylic paint - either in a garage or on a day when it isn't windy. It drys quickly.   I'm not fussy about "indoor" "outdoor" or whatever paint --- it's cheep.  If it doesn't hold up, next summer I'd spray it all over again.   Only takes 5 minutes.

Flatten plastic playing cards
Try using a clothes iron.  The idea being that the heat will loosen up the plastic while the iron pushes it flat.  Keep the iron on a low temperature.  The important thing is that after you have heated up the card, you turn the iron off and leave it resting on the card.  Let the iron cool to room temperature before taking off the card.Note, as this might totally ruin your card, maybe try it on a joker or something first.
Possibile ways to charge a mobile in a train
You could acquire a portable fuel cell charger or a power bank.Fuel Cell chargers usually need longer to charge a phone as they have to produce the energy on the fly, but with enough fuel you have almost endless recharges available.Power banks are a one-time solution as they will have to be recharged after use, but supply their reserves faster.

How to seal envelopes without licking
Get a selotape dispenser, the large ones you have in an office. Without a roll of tape on the reel bit, pour some water into the 'res' where the tape would normally sit, then spin the wheel to get it wet and use this to dampen the envelope.We used to use this in a post room at a university when doing mass mailings and it works really well, as long as the selotape dispenser has the right kind of 'wheel' on it.
How to make my bony shoulder comfortable for resting head on?
Why pretend to be nonchalant -  just be actually confident and casual about it instead. If someone wants to lay their head on your shoulder, tell 'em its boney and uncomfortable and that you'll fold your coat or jumper or whatever and pad it with that for them, because you're very happy for them to use your shoulder but it might be uncomfortable for them, or use a cushion if you're somewhere there's one lying about.Unfortunately, there is no optimum position you can adopt to reduce or cushion the bones - wherever you put your arm, those bones at the top will still be there.

Not a hack but cheap and very effective (no endorsement of the specific brand or sales pitch, this is just for illustration) http://www.victorpest.com/store/mouse-control/bm007-4 . This type is small enough to fit into spots the larger life traps do no and works really well.Just put them out at a popular mouse spot with some peanut butter in it and the next morning you have a guest ready for re-location. 
Flatten plastic playing cards
When facing bent cards, I usually do one of two things: Unbend them, or press them flat. UnbendingUsually bent cards can be made straight by bending them the other way of the original bend. In some cases running them over an edge curving them against the bend could be helpful. Applying pressureIn some stubborn cases I've resorted to putting cards in a book, and then some more books on top of this for extra weight and pressure. Leave over night, and the cards are often good to go. I've never had to use extra heat to flatten cards, but if I should try that I would use a pan filled with warm water from the spring/tap. Put on top of cards and leave over night. 
How to make my bony shoulder comfortable for resting head on?
In most scenarios when someone rests their head on your shoulder its a sign of his/her affections towards you. In such situations how boney your shoulder is will not be an issue for that person. Nobody's shoulder is really comfortable to lean on but the person who is leaning their head will subconsciously adjust to compensate.Carrying something specifically for that purpose could seem too keen and could be off putting.
How to get cat urine smell out of wooden floors?
vinegar is better at cutting more harmful bacteria than bleach.If you have a problem with the straight vinegar smell you can all ways usecider vinegar.  I make my own orange vinegar to use on cleaning the house,I moved into an old home which also has the wood flooring under layers of carpet. I also have cats & puppies.  They are drawn to the smell I used my carpet cleaner with the cider vinegar in it instead of soap. Turned on as many fans that I could find and also the dehydrator after finished the cleaning.After a few days I put either lime or diatomaceous earth.This is working great.  One room at a time but it is getting done.

How can I keep 2 blankets together on a bed?

Possibile ways to charge a mobile in a train
As Dawnkeeper suggest your safest bet is to use use a power bank or portable fuel charger, but if you want to use the electricity already on the train you your best bet is to locate one which could be slightly hidden and utilise this one. I.e. maybe there is lights in your compartment attached to a socket, or a socket in the bath room (if you have one), underneath the seat, behind a panel (slightly more illegal perhaps).If no hidden sockets are to be found, or if all are occupied, you could bring your own multi-outlet/power strip/extension cord and disconnect the previous appliance and then reconnect that and your charger in addition. This could even provide another socket (or two) for other in same predicament.Touching illegal you could argue that you have the option to disconnect switches or lamp bulbs and connect two wires to these and use that as a makeshift socket, but I would strongly advise against any such hacks as you are aboard  a moving train which shifts around which adds to the danger of tampering with live electricity and increases the risks of short circuiting and hurting your self and others.
What is the best way to paint a windshield wiper arm?
One non paint/marker pen alternative to just cover the large areas is to ask for an off-cut of matt black outdoor/automotive vinyl from a sign writing shop.  Stick it to the largest flat areas that are the biggest reflection problem, it will eventually peel but may last a year or more.Another is black insulation tape but this will be gloss and peel sooner than good vinyl.Lastly if the cosmetics are not high on your list then bicycle handlebar tape wrapped all around the arm should fix it for you. It is weather resistant and matt and available in black, might look a bit grunge but solve the problem for a couple of years at a time.

How to untie sacks properly (eg bags of charcoal)
I have had to open many feed back in my time, my mom taught me to cut the threads flush with the edge of the bag and then pick at the ends for one that will start to un-stitch, (ours were generally the dual thread stitch but it works the same with the single thread) if that edge will not start the process then do the other side, the time wasted trying to find the free end in the knotted free ends is usually better spent on enjoying nature or some such.If you have to do lots you will usually find that all the bags in one batch are sewn the same and you can rely of the side of the bag with the label or the edge closer to the sewn in tags indicating which is the start.
How do I clean the farthest molars without invoking gag reflex?
Use a small headed toothbrush - I have a similar problem to yours, and I use two brushes to clean my teeth, one is the smallest possible standard headed brush, but the other has a very small head, and that's the one I employ when doing right at the back of the mouth. Actually, its a child's brush, because I couldn't find a small enough head in the adult range in the store at the time. Corsyodyl make a small headed, oval shaped brush, and that one's okay, Amazon sells them in soft or medium. The alternative is an electric toothbrush with a round headed brush, such as most of the Oral B range has, but if the interior oral cavity is small (as is mine) I find it quite difficult to manouevre a clunky electric handle and stem within the mouth to cover all surfaces.

How to easily start a fire in a charcoal for grilling without using gas?
Paper and cooking oil. You can make a bed of scrunched up paper (newspaper is probably about the best) under the charcoal. Paper burns up quickly so you need a lot of it. You can drizzle cooking oil on the charcoal. Cooking oil won't set light easily but the burning paper will get it hot enough and give the flames enough intesity and longevity to get the coals smouldering. I'm assuming this is for a barbecue. When getting it started, you want it sheltered from the wind (but not smothered with a lid). Once the flames have died down, you want to get airflow to the coals, by moving it if safe.
How to easily start a fire in a charcoal for grilling without using gas?
I really like to use the "chimney starter" that came with my Weber Kettle for this. I really don't want to advertise for Weber but those things are good! You may find something comparable or can build one yourself.Instead of just placing the charcoals in your grill, place your chimney starter in the grill and fill that with charcoals. Then just stuff some ring shaped newspaper underneath it, make sure air supply is ensured and light it.Your charcoal is ready whey you see  orange color deep inside the chimney starter. Make sure to wear heat-resistant gloves and pour the charcoals into your grill.The below image uses paraffin cubes instead of newspaper. You can basically use any kind of firelighters, but you'll usually already have some newspaper laying around.Text- & image-source:The Virtual Weber Bullet - How To Use A Chimney Starter
How to avoid losing keys/phone/wallet?
I used to have this problem on a morning whilst getting ready.  Usually after I'd left the bathroom I'd have to backtrack to find my phone.  I had a habit of carrying my phone until the first point I needed both hands and at the point would put it down somewhere.  Typically I'd wonder where my phone was five minutes later and have to search for it.  I'd find it in all kinds of places; on top of the fridge, on the arm of the couch, etc...A couple of years ago I stared making a conscious effort to put my phone in a specific place every morning.  At first this felt unnatural but I taught myself to do it and now rarely, if ever, have this problem.
How to remove "wet dog" smell from washed dishes?
Bacteria is breeding in the microscopic holes and cracks in the dishware.  Water that is exposed is also getting trapped in these crevices.  Super heating the water and using bleach-based detergent will kill the bacteria.  Allow them to soak for several hours before washing them and then afterward, rinse them with as heated water as you can stand.  Allow them to dry standing apart so that the water can fully evaporate and the mildew won't have a place to properly regrow.  It is also a good idea to re-rinse them right after you've used them, as there is brand-new bacteria present that will quite happily grow while sitting in your sink.Bleaching the sink, itself, is an added safeguard.
How do I eat from a bowl without needing to clean it?
If you are in an area that has access to disposable bowls, particularly paper ones, it will be much easier on the environment than lining a bowl with plastic.  While it isn't exactly a hack to simply buy paper bowls, at my grocery store, a "party package" of 200 disposable paper bowls is a few dollars less than a similar number of plastic bags or aluminum foil. At my store, you could have one bowl per day for an entire year and be within a $10 budget. If stored in a dry place and such an occurrence happened only intermittently, one pack of them could last beyond a year.
How to easily start a fire in a charcoal for grilling without using gas?
I've used different techniques with more or less success :simple plain Zip barbecue starters (or similar) : not very efficient used alonezip + paper : slightly more efficient, not much, paper won't last longpaper + kindling : like this method, but can be a bit slow and do a lot of smoke, you also need kindling...zip + kindling : a bit less smoke and ashes than previous methodbasically, I love using kindling, but there are also other solutions like the one proposed by Alex. I've already seen it in action and indeed it was quite impressive. You don't need to go Weber for this, other brands have this kind of tool, the idea being to avoid charcoal to spread and concentrate it right above the fire. Air circulation is also very good. Some barbecue actually include this "chimney" under the barbecue self. But that's a tool more that you need...
How to avoid losing keys/phone/wallet?
This is probably a focus  and habit issue as opposed to forgetfulness. How many things have you got going on at once? Try doing one thing at a time and extend the boundaries of  start/ finish are.What I mean is when you think "I need to drive to work." The start of that journey is not when you get in the car, it's all the things that lead you there - so pretty much the alarm, showering, dressing, ensuring you have your wallet and other things needed for the day.The end of the journey isn't when you stop the car, it's when you get to the point you are intending to start you next thing. So for me, my journey finishes once my computer boots up at work and I've clocked in.Then it's a case of building habits So it's repeatable.you can do this by taking a calendar, and every day marking off when you remembered your keys/wallet/phone. You aim is then to not break the habit chain!
How to easily start a fire in a charcoal for grilling without using gas?
I used an electric coil BBQ starter. It's a heating element like you would find at the bottom of your dishwasher, but small with a handle and a cord. You stack the charcol briquetes in a pyrimid on top of it and plug it in. In a few minutes the coal will start with a small flame. Take the coil out so not to damage it and wha-la a fire with out gas, starter or oil.
Sealing reused plastic sacks
If the bags are of reasonable width, and were originally heat-sealed, then there are many commercial heat sealers which will do the trick. Search for "heat sealer"; the wider the sealing bar, the more expensive the sealer. (You probably wouldn't get far with a consumer heat sealer; not enough power for the probably-thick plastic.)
What can I do to minimise the physical fatigue I get by driving scooter?
This might be a medical issue - as the scooter is motorised, its clearly not the physical effort making you tired. There is mental effort, negotiating traffic on the way, but that wouldn't really explain your tiredness UNLESS you find the drive terrifying or it makes you feel panicked or very stressed every time. That would cause fatigue. Not sure how you could reduce your anxiety about the journey other than simply becoming accustomed to it over time.If you're fatigued after the journey home as well as the journey to work, and the journey is always in heavy traffic, the next likeliest explanation is your intake of pollutants in the air on the journey. Even persons driving a car with the windows closed show high levels of pollutants in their blood after a 20 minute drive, mostly caused by all the traffic on the roads. Sensitive individuals may respond to air borne pollutants by unconsciously  hyperventilating, and that alone can make a person feel tired, never mind the effort the body has to go to try to deal with the toxins in the system. In which case, I suggest you do some research and find a suitable and efficient mask you can wear to reduce or minimize the amount of fumes and pollutants you're breathing in to see if that helps.The link below is for a pollution mask favoured by some cyclists in London, no idea if you can get it where you are, but its more comfortable to wear than most and fits better on female faces:http://totobobo.com/Respro is another brand much more commonly used though I can't speak for the efficacy of either of these. If, though, you experience this fatigue at other times when you're not riding your scooter, a visit to the doctor is probably called for to eliminate other possible, health related reasons.
Sealing reused plastic sacks
In the youtube-video How to Seal Plastic Bag at Home #Ludvic #Maker, demonstrates a rather hackish way of sealing plastic bags. In essence what he does is lay the plastic bag flat, put a piece of paper over the top of the bag and then use a soldering iron to transfer heat through the paper and melt close the plastic bag.Variation over this method could be to use other heat sources:soldering iron (as suggested in video)edge of clothes ironhot glue gun (possibly without glue?) (that is use the heated tip of the glue gun, not the actual gluing capabilities :-) )a hair iron (the ones for straightening hair)some other heated metal-stripThe point of using the paper between the bag and the heat source, I contemplate is to avoid getting melted plastic on your heat source. I would also consider double sealing them for additional strength. That is don't run the sealing strip only once, but twice across the top of the bag.
How to Keep Phone Cool in Car
I found a Chinese patent for a Multifunctional Automobile Air-Conditioner Air Outlet Baffle, filed two years ago, but I can't find evidence that it is in production anywhere. Nor have I been able to find a for-sale baffle designed to mount to a car air vent. However, if you consider yourself handy, you might try buying one of the phone air vent mounts and modifying it to redirect the air from the vent in a desired direction.
What can I do to minimise the physical fatigue I get by driving scooter?
You may consider reducing various environmental issues that could be fatiguing you while you ride:Reduce the absolute level of noise with semi-permeable earplugs (enough blocking to keep you from being deafened, but NOT enough to make you deaf!)Better padding on the seatBetter back support (not sure how this would work)Pollution mask (as suggested by @Bamboo)Make sure you don't grip the handlebars too tightly
How to avoid losing keys/phone/wallet?
Personally, I mentally recite the mantra "wallet, phone, keys" about a dozen times a day, while tapping the relevant pocket - it's not really a hack, but it's pretty effective. The nice thing is that, after a few repetitions, the mantra becomes this single block that you recall in it's entirety, rather than a list of items to be remembered individually. Combined with the tapping, you learn to recognise both patterns, and if you miss an item in either then the two become jarringly misaligned.You can make the mantra as complex as you need it to be, with a dozen items if necessary, and you still only have one "thing" that you actually need to remember. With repetition, "wallet, phone, keys, pen, watch, hob, window, lights" is no harder to remember than "wallet".Spend a week or two making a conscious effort to perform this recitation/tapping ritual in any place where you might previously have lost something. Hopefully, by then, it will be something that you do instinctively.
How to easily start a fire in a charcoal for grilling without using gas?
Toilet paper and cooking oil:Make 4-5 cones of toilet paper by wrapping it round 3 fingers about 6 times.Drizzle cooking oil into each cone, about a teaspoon in each (it can get messy, do this over the charcoal)Spread the cones evenly through the charcoal and sort of bury them in so the top of the cones are at the same level as the top of the bed, standing vertically.Place a few pieces of charcoal around the top edges of the cones, but not covering them completely.Carefully light each cone and watch it all take placeMake sure the cones are big enough and saturated enough that they don't burn out too quickly. You may need to shuffle the charcoal around a bit to make sure they are getting enough flames on them.This method is as effective as using firelighters (and cheaper, and probably cleaner!).
How to remove "wet dog" smell from washed dishes?
Run the dishes through the dishwasher, don't let dryWith a good amount of bleach (1/2 cup) in a sink filled with water, let the dishes soak for a couple of hours.Rinse the dishes and place on dish rack to dryDo the dishes smell bad still? If yes, then it is your water lines. Maybe you have some excessive sulfur or algae or bacteria in the lines and or your well (if not on a municipal water supply). You will probably want to get your water tested. If no, continue.Since we were a "no" on the last step, the dishes smell okay now. We know it was either bacteria in/on the dishes or the dishwasher. Run the dishes through the dishwasher.If the dishes smell bad, the bad smell is getting put onto the dishes by the dishwasher. Follow your manufacturer's instructions on cleaning the dishwasher. If the dishes smell okay, then it was bacteria on the dishes themselves.
How to Keep Phone Cool in Car
Once I had a GPS mounted on my dashboard which overheated, and after a while displayed that I had a speed of 416 kph (approx 260 mph), which is quite fast for a Renault Clio 1.4tn (1994 mod). However this experience thought me two things:Having stuff on top of the dashboard is a bad idea when considering heat. Move your device somewhere else to eliminate the heating in the first placeIn order for it to cool, and function again I needed to cool it down. Fast. Holding the device out of the window cooled it down within minutes. Albeit maybe not the best idea with regards to traffic security, but if you take care it does indeed workRegarding moving the device of the dashboard, you could either mount in a standard holder in front of the air condition which should provide cooling, or put it in a side compartment in the door, or even a glove box. The main point is to keep it out off the dashboard with direct sun light providing a lot of heat.
How to remove "wet dog" smell from washed dishes?
Most likely the smell arises from slightly contaminated water which when dried off leaves that smell. This water could either be on the dishes, or in the dish washer. The contamination is either based on the washing cycle, or due to left overs from earlier runs of the dishwasher (in which case it is somehow stored within the dish washer (i.e. filter, hoses, etc.)).Is it a health risk? That is not for me to decide, but most likely not since the dishes have been washed in high temperatures and with detergents to help clean the dishes. It is however still not wanted.Some alternate solutions to reduce/remove the issue:Add a little bleach to the tub below the dishes after the dishwasher completes the cycle, return the bottom rack with the dishes still in. After an hour or so, remove dishes.  Make sure that hosing/plumbing of the dish washer is as it supposed to be. That is that drain pipes are installed according to instructions, and maybe you need to incorporate a high loop or dishwasher air gapEnsure that the dish washer works properly, and has the needed fluids. On some dish washers you need to refill salt and rinse aids regularlyDo a thorough rinse of your dish washer using suitable detergents. Cleanse all the filters and hoses as you see fitAs a prevention mechanism, rinse your dishes before putting them into the dish washer (Preferrably with cold water)Don't leave the dish washer closed after running a cycle. Open it up, and let the heat help the drying processHopefully this would help you get rid of the smelly dishes.You might need to clean your dishwasher at regular intervals, but that interval should be in the time span of weeks/months, and not after each run.

Get a old ice cube tray or two, I use six at a time. Get a old sauce pan, melt wax and pour. "Hint" Garage sales for old candles or buy some its cheap. Some people use old egg cartons and do away with standard charcoal use hard wood charcoal.
What is a temporary solution for a damaged car body?
Duct tape to the rescue!If we're talking a week or two, then you are running relative low risk of getting rust. If on the other side you want to be sure, then you need to protect that area from getting wet and have access to air, which are needed for it to rust.Using a bit of duct tape to cover the scratch should suffice to keep it dry and limit air access. You can even get black duct tape, if you are worried on the esthetic aspect.Edit: Quick fix or not...Using tape (or grease as suggested in another answer) are quick fixes, which are easily reverted. Using glue or nail varnish (as suggested in some of the other answwers), is slightly more permanent and not so easy to remove when you want to do the real fix later on.  In essence, the main idea in most of the answers so far, is to cover up the affected area. But be careful that whatever cover you are using, it won't create extra work when you want to do real fix (i.e. having to sand away the previous fix, when an easier wash operation could have sufficed).
What is a temporary solution for a damaged car body?
A small dob of grease over the affected area will keep water off.It is easily removed come the time of a proper repair and does not run the risk of further damage from overly aggressive tape adhesive.The grease will stay put during rain.The grease will collect road dirt as you continue to drive, but this sticks to the surface of the grease and comes away easily when needed.
What is a temporary solution for a damaged car body?
The damage pictures appears to be on a bumper which is made of ABS plastic and therefore won't rust.If it were a metal panel, a temporary fix is a dab of nail varnish.
What is a temporary solution for a damaged car body?
If your bumper is made of plastic there is no chance of rust. Rust is the metals  oxidizing.If it is metal a few layers of PVA glue will protect the metal and not look as bad as tape or grease.
How to light a candle without a lighter or a match
When I don't have a lighter or matches to light up a cigarette, I usually use the heating part of a toaster. Not sure if you can reach it with a candle...
How can I remove sticky residue left by a vinyl sticker from the back of my iPad?
Use WD-40. Apply, wait a minute and remove it. It works wonders to remove sticky residue.
What is a temporary solution for a damaged car body?
I know of a person that put wax on a spot of rust to prevent any more water/oxygen getting to it.  He didn't get back to it for a long time, but when he finally did look at it again, the rust hadn't spread.  This was, if I recall correctly, in a protected area of the car, so might not apply as readily to external damage.  Could be a quick fix for someone, though, so I thought I might mention it.
How can I remove sticky residue left by a vinyl sticker from the back of my iPad?
Keep some lacquer thinner on hand (can be bought at any hardware store). It is a strong solvent for thinning (obviously) and removing paint, but it works fantastic on adhesives as well and will not leave a residue. tip some onto a paper towel. be careful if the surface you're using it on is painted. the adhesive will come off easier than the paint, but if you're not careful that paint will come off eventually.
How can I remove sticky residue left by a vinyl sticker from the back of my iPad?
Acetone is probably the best sticky residue remover I ever used but it's not technically a lifehack as it isn't such a usual matter that you have it at hand.
How can I remove sticky residue left by a vinyl sticker from the back of my iPad?
The alcohol idea seems like a good one but I have never used it. What should work for sure is applying heat. Glue dissolves if confronted with heat. That means pointing a hair dryer on the spot with the sticky residue should get it to "melt" and become easier to remove. I would therefore warm it up like this and rub off the remains with alcohol afterwards.And of course I do realize that not every device lends itself to head. So under no circumstances should you ever put any device like a mobile phone or an iPad into a microwave. That can be dangerous. That should be logical to everyone. So under no circumstances should you ever try to back or cook a device. It might remove the sticky clue but it would also totally destroy your iPad and possibly even get the microwave to blow up. Pointing a hair dryer on the part with the sticky residue should be "survivable" for your i-Pad
How can I remove sticky residue left by a vinyl sticker from the back of my iPad?
First thing first, I am going to suggest Acetone, that is nail polish remover.  If you can obtain near 100% acetone from a hardware store please do.  Words of warning:Acetone is flammable. It burns like gasoline.Acetone eats plastics - It is the foundation of many plastics contact with              plastics is not advised as it will attack them.I recommend working with a fan over your work area to reduce the risk of inhalation and it will help disperse evaporating acetone in order mediate fire risk.Sure lots of warnings and sounds like overkill... better to be safe than on fire.Test if the acetone attacks the type of tape residue you want toremove on a test item.  If it does so then you can proceed.Important, take a q-tip covered in acetone and on a small patch on the back of the ipad rub with q-tip. Don't press too hard, and wait until it dries which should take a few seconds.    Confirm visually and by touch that no reaction has occurred.  Discoloration and texture may change if the material on your ipad back is reactive with acetone.If good to go, then have it, acetone will attack most glues and plastics used in tapes. Acetone evaporates readily so just work at it until you have removed the residue traces.  Alcohols that are very strong of ethyl and methyl types are an alternative but mostly same warnings apply, except you shouldn't have reactivity with any plastics. They can be helpful to remove anything that wasn't destroyed by the acetone and on their own.
What is a temporary solution for a damaged car body?
I would use a can of spray primer, as it would not need to be removed when you do the repair.
How can I fortify micro USB connectors
The solution is to obtain a normal USB cable of the required length, and use/purchase a USB to USB Micro adapter:Plug USB cable into charger USB portPlug adapter into USB CablePlug Adapter into phone.You will be able to easily replace the adapters and keep them spare in the event you are too heavy handed.  Look around at the cables and adapters available, you could use USB mini to micro if that suited better.I cannot really help you with a way to stop breaking something that is designed to fail if rather than the socket if over stressed.  But I hope this makes it less annoying as you can mitigate it with just a cheap adapter.
How to separate plastic grocery bags?
If you are not afraid to pull a little piece of a rubber glove out of your pocket or purse, this works very well. Place the small piece between your fingers and rub on both sides of the bag and the bag immediately has an opening. Very easy and works every time. I also use this method to get a better "grip" to open jars--no slip grip!
How to open roller shutters silently
The shutters are probably acting as a big diaphragm, vibrating as they close and causing noise. Try holding something flexible (e.g. a towel) against the shutters as they roll up, to dampen this vibration and thus the sound. My guess is that this would work best near the top, where they are disappearing into the housing (and thus bending and vibrating).
How to open roller shutters silently
Why don't you use a folded blanket or any cloth curtain that you can somehow fasten whether the roller shutters are closed or opened? Then you can easily remove the blanket at night when you want some cool air. But one thing which you need to think about and be cautious about, is the security of the blanket according to your locality and location of room and window. 
How to open roller shutters silently
We have shutters exactly like that, and it is a very common noise at any time, especially in summer when people put them down during the day. My way to do this quietly is to pull the band slowly and steadily. It still makes a noise but is not loud or abrupt. When it is nearly at the top slow down even more to avoid the bang when it reaches the end.Actually, here people tend to get up at 6 am so these things go up then, and this is a noise you learn to overhear, like church bells or the newspaper delivery moped.
Can laser pointers defend you from wild cats?
Setting aside for the moment the (somewhat ridiculous) issue of whether a cheetah, leopard or the like that plans to attack and eat you could be distracted into not doing so, especially by something as small as the dot of a laser pointer, no, this will not work. Laser pointers distract house pets because they make a small bright dot on a smooth surface like a floor or wall. A wild cat who plans to attack you will doubtless do so in a much more heterogeneous environment, like a jungle trail, where one little spot of light moving around will really mean nothing to them.Besides, if a wild cat intends to eat you, you won't know until its teeth are in the back of your neck. Watch your pet house cat attack that toy mouse you give it, or stalk a bird in the backyard. Your opportunities for interaction before you are pounced on simply do not exist.
Is the handle of this luggage retractable?
This type of luggage does have a retractable handle. Normally the release mechanism is in the handle. It is very easy to damage the handle enough to prevent retraction, or it could have been "repaired" in a way that prevents moving the handle to its recessed position.
Removing mold from walls without use of harmful chemicals
There are so many DIY tips available on internet for mould removal. But let me tell you one thing, sometimes mould can be toxic. Some mould can produce spores that have mycotoxins that are very harmful if inhaled. So I would recommend you to hire a professional team who will help you remove mould safely. 
Removing mold from walls without use of harmful chemicals
When noticing mold, be sure to get into your attic + check for mold.Use a flashlight or smell the air. If your attic smells musty, then you may have mold in your walls.The easy way to get rid of mold in walls is to place one or more (depending on size of your home) industrial ozone generators in your attic + leave them running for a few days.You can also do this inside your house too to get places that are difficult to reach with spray bottles, like between walls + built in furniture.Works well.In Austin, every few years we have a wet summer, where mold abounds. Whenever heat + moisture occur together, we flip on ozone generators all over the house now. We do this before mold occurs, to ensure no mold takes hold.
How can I fortify micro USB connectors
I was hesitant to post this since user2813274 posted this in a comment, and goes into the grey area of product recommendation, but I think it's worth fleshing out a  little (and I can't simply make the comment because I'm new to the site).The QI charging is remarkably convenient and can eliminate all use of physically connecting a plug depending on use. It does charge slightly slower than a physical connection, but this can be countered to a certain extent by reducing power consumption by either turning the phone off or utilizing flight mode while charging.If the need is syncing, cloud computing is becoming more ubiquitous, and so many of the functions that a phone would have needed to be synced with in the past can be done over the internet now.  Syncing contacts, media like photos, music, or video, and calendars can be done over the cloud now. I believe mentioning specific services delves into the realm of recommending products, so I'll refrain.In the event you would need to charge more quickly, or attach to sync something over a cord, QI pads often use the same micro USB cord, so you can simply unplug from the QI pad and carefully insert into the bottom of your phone.  There are a few tricks I use to make sure it gets inserted and uninserted properly.1) The "USB" symbol is often on the top side of the cord. (Incidentally: This is true of the original Samsung cords. Incidentally, Samsung chargers and cords charge faster and have some features not built into generic cords. This is why when using your phone as a GPS, in some circumstances it will drain the battery even when plugged in and charging.)2)  Figure out which orientation it goes in your device. In mine, the side with the USB symbol is the same side that the screen is on.3) Firmly cradle the device with your non-dominant hand, with the port facing your body.  Grasp the USB cable between the thumb and index finger. Place your middle or ring finger on the phone and use that to stabilize your dominant hand as it inserts/removes the cord into the phone. This allows for more control so one can keep the cord parallel with the port orientation.Permanent quote from the linked source:To explain: The mains charger supplied with the S4 is a model number  ETA-U90UWE, rated 5V @ 2A. However, the phone will ONLY charge at full  current (which as I have measured so far, depending on what the phone  regulates it to, typically sits in the region of 1.2 - 1.5A), when  using the supplied charger (or possibly one of equal or higher current  rating, depending on how it's configured internally), AND the supplied  usb cable, OR any other usb cable, provided its shielding (the metal  outer surface of the connectors) is connected at BOTH ends of the  cable. Use a cable that doesn't have this shielding, and the charge  current drops, regardless of whether there is plenty of current  available or not. Use a different charger with an unshielded cable and  the current drops even more, again regardless of whether it can supply  plenty more current. My assumption on this, is possibly an effort by  Samsung to avoid the scenario of sticking 1.5 amps down a flimsy  cheapo cable, the wires of which will likely be too thin to carry it.After doing some probing around with a meter, I have managed to find  a slight difference with the charger itself, compared to a generic  one. In a generic one, the two data pins are usually just shorted  together, which tells most phones that it's a mains charger rather  than a USB port. On the Samsung one on the other hand, the pins appear  to be shorted together, and also connected via resistors across the  supply line (known as a potential divider), which holds these shorted  data pins at a certain voltage. This is what tells the phone what sort  of charger it's connected to.
How to remove blood stain from sneakers?
In reference to removing blood, I've had good luck with hydrogen peroxide. This might need to be done while the blood is fresh though, I have only done it with fresh blood. Just pour a good amount on the blood, let it finish bubbling, blot the liquid up and repeat as necessary. Warning: I don't remember if I've done this with colored fabrics so there is a possibility of bleaching the color out by doing this. I would test on an inconspicuous area first. 
How to remove blood stain from sneakers?
Right after you get blood on your shoes, immediately begin trying to get the stains off. No matter what method you try, that will greatly improve the chances of it working effectively, especially with the method that I typically use and will mention here. To do this, soak your shoes in cold salt water for 1-2 hours. The time can vary, but usually it will it will be somewhere in that time frame. After it soaks, you may want to scrub the stain a bit with some soap or laundry detergent. If you can't get it just by scrubbing, you can also throw it into washing machine, then into the dryer.
How to remove dust from fridge coils?
Do you have a hair blow dryer? That would definitely help.  An inexpensive can of compressed air could work too.  (Both of those would be extremely messy; it might help to be running one or more household vacuums around the refrigerator at the same time.)I suspect you could also get a feather duster wand.  (A specific brand comes to mind, but it's not polite to mention brands on this forum!)
How to remove blood stain from sneakers?
No hack answer this, but there's only one thing that might work well - Vanish, the powder stuff in a container that you mix with water in the right ratio. Drop the sneakers into the solution and soak for six hours, then run them through the washing machine. Only suitable if your trainers can be put through such a process though... but this seems to get out the most resistant stains except for rust. You can only do this if the sneakers are not leather, and the eyelets for the lace holes aren't made of metal.Otherwise, Vanish Gold might do it - never tried it personally - that's a liquid and you apply it direct to the stain, rub it in with the cap for a while, then put through the wash.
How can i clean my car seats that is made of fabric?
It very much depends on how dirty they are.  I personally find the a good vacuum using the stiff brush attachment is sufficient for most seats.  There are various dry / foaming shampoo products specifically for this application which can help here.If they are more stained it is possible to use a steam cleaner to clean them but you may need to leave the car with its windows open afterwards to allow the seats to dry out fully.I am aware of at least one person who has removed their seats and unclipped the fabric covers from the seats so they could be run through a washing machine but this will be time consuming and will require a selection of tools and quite a lot of dis/re-assembly.
How can I defog a bathroom mirror?
One solution I've found that helps in this situation is to apply an automotive product intended for car windscreens to the mirror such as Rain-X.  When the bathroom is dry and humidity free, clean the mirror thoroughly making sure there is no residue left.  Old newspaper works surprisingly well.  Once it is completely clean and dry, apply Rain-X (or an alternative brand) as per the manufacturers instructions.  You should find that the mirror now doesn't get anywhere near as foggy as it did before.  I should warn you though, wiping the mirror will impair the performance of the product and you will have to re-apply it.
How can I defog a bathroom mirror?
I once discovered, that a hair dryer entirely removes that fog.Simply point the hair dryer at your mirror and blow hot air out.I usually only defog the top middle of the mirror, so I can make sure my face is still as sexy as I remember it to be. ;)
How can I defog a bathroom mirror?
You can buy PLASTIC shaving mirrors for this very reason. With mine, I find that pointing the shower at it for a few seconds is enough to stop it steaming up.I sometimes also use a free-standing glass mirror. With that, splashing the mirror with water isn't enough, you need to get the mirror too hot for steam to condense. I usually run very hot water over it for 10 seconds or more - or even immerse it in a sink of hot water if that's convenient.
How can I defog a bathroom mirror?
Fogless shaving mirrors exist. Just Google them. (Not much of a lifehack, but it is a solution!)
How to get cat urine smell out of wooden floors?
A lot of post about using enzyme  base cleaners on plywood subfloors.Not a good idea.Reason, these types of cleaners eat the urine compounds,then continue on to eat the cellulose fibers in the wood itself.Cellulose is what gives wood it's strenght.I used one of the first enzymatic  cleaners on the market, purchased on the net and cost a fortune.While it did remove the smell, it also ate the floor, it took several years but one day I stepped right through the floor. In essence it worked, had to rip out the floor. Now these products warn not to use on unfinished wood.
How can I defog a bathroom mirror?
As a workaround, you could shave before taking a shower. Not only does it avoid the fogged-mirror problem, it also makes rinsing excess shaving cream easier.
How to remove blood stain from sneakers?
I use cream of tartar (from the spice aisle) for blood.  Make sure you don't wash the stain with hot or warm water first.Wet the spot with cold water, sprinkle on some cream of tartar, rub it in, let it sit for at least 10 minutes.  Then, without rinsing, do some scrubbing with an old toothbrush.  Then continue scrubbing while rinsing under a stream of cold water.I'm not so sure this next idea will help, but as a second step, you could try the following, which is popular in Mexico for general spot removal on white fabric: squeeze some fresh lemon or lime juice on the spot, and put the article in the sun for a few hours.  Then wash and rinse well.As a final step, the shoe cleaning aisle in a store will have some white liquid stuff designed to put on white leather shoes, and you could try a dab of that to even out the color.
How can I keep from squirting myself with ketchup whenever I use ketchup packets?
Pinch just below the torn opening with two fingers, so that your fingers are controlling the direction the catsup is going -- ideally, downward.  This works for me.
How to separate plastic grocery bags?
Quick solution which is more hygienic than licking your finger: touch your tongue to a spot near the cut edge of the bag.  I figure that the bag, having just come off the roll or the stack, must be cleaner than your finger is in a grocery store environment.
How can I defog a bathroom mirror?
A simple cheap method - use 50-50 solution of vinegar & water, add a dash of dishwashing soap, spray on the mirror and wipe it clean with old newspaper/towel.mirror will be fog free for a few days 
How can I defog a bathroom mirror?
If it's a smaller bathroom, what I find works really really quickly is to open and close the door quickly, you can feel the draft you're pulling into the room and the air you're pushing out. Try it!
Using binder clips to hold cables
You're right, I don't think there IS a right-size clip for this. I have an 18mm desktop too and the medium-sized clip (32mm wide) won't fit. If it DID fit, the lever part would be too big for most cables - they would drop right through.So we need to be using the smaller clips - and that means a thinner (very thin) desktop. The only thing I can suggest is that you try using the BIGGEST clip to attach a piece of cardboard or plywood to the desk surface - then have the smallest clips on that piece of thin board to hold the cables.EDIT: I was quite impressed with this that I just found on Google Images. I shows that the largest clips CAN be used but in a slightly different way:
How to turn off the lights without getting out of bed?
Two ideas spring into mind, so I have to make two answers to this one:Remote controlToday there exists loads of remote controlling actions in the shops, just try searching for remote control light switch or remote control light bulb or variations over these terms. Tons of solutions will be given to remote control to switch either the switch or the bulb. Controls can be a separate remote control or an app in your smart phone.However where is the fun and lifehack of this solution? Enter the line remote switch:If you add a few hooks/rings you can run a line from the light switch to your bed, and in the configuration shown you would detach the line from the end hook releasing the hammer which falls down and turns of the light!Variations over this if you have different kind of switches could easily be made. If you have the ones with a tap sticking out you could possibly make it go both on and off using the line and a sliding mechanism close to the switch
How to turn off the lights without getting out of bed?
Two ideas spring into mind, so I have to make two answers to this one:Delay switchesInstead of using remote controls as suggested in another answer, you could also add some sort of delay mechanism to turn off the lights. This could be in the form of timer delay switches which can be tuned to shut of the light after a given amount of time (enough for you to get into bed). These switch could either be built into the switch by electricians, or you could use the 'kitchen safety' variants and put a lamp instead of your kitchen appliance into it.But yet again, where is the fun and lifehack of this solution? Here is a suggestion for a DIY delay switch solution:The principle here is that you build a little bracket around the light switch, which are constructed out of three main parts:The bracket holding everything togetherA receiving container which slides within the bracket, so that when it is heavy enough it will push the light switch and turn of the lights. You might need to modify the bottom of this container so as there is a point/stick/... which easily hits the switchA delivering container which has a small hole delivering the content into the receiver after a suitable length of timeIn my drawing I've used a water bottle with a hole in the side, and some mug to receive the water. Normally water and electricity is not a good combination, but this setup should be safe as long as you don't have more water in the bottle then can fit into the receiving container.You could of course also switch to sand or some other media, but water is the simplest to describe and to make! When you want to use this device you turn on the light, and insert the bottle with enough water to give you a proper delay.
Using binder clips to hold cables
To my experience these clips do not come in a great variety of sizes, which could give you a little problem. However as long as you have one which is too large it is simply a matter of attaching something beneath the surface to make it a better fit.You could either fold up some paper or cardboard or even a strip of wood, and put this below the desk so it is not visible. This should make the standard sizes of clips an easy fit to your desk.
How to remove dust from fridge coils?
After doing a search for "whirlpool side by side refrigerator clean coils" there are some videoes suggesting variations over this procedure:Empty out the refrigerator to make it easier to handle, and disconnect it from the main supplyGet another person to tilt the refrigerator, so that the bottom is easier available (Do not tip it over, but just tilt it enough for you to get access under it)Use your choice of cleaner to clean out the coils. Some cleaners which are available:Vacuum cleaner (with or without the possiblity to reverse the air flow)Damp, soft clothsRefrigerator coil brush or other sorts of suitable brushesReset the refrigerator, fill it and turn it back on again 
How to remove dust from fridge coils?
If you fit your vacuum cleaner with it's narrow nozzle and tape two or three drinks straws securely into this you can then use the vacuum cleaner on a relatively low setting to get right in between the fridge coils with the end of the drinks straws which are now effectively the end of your vacuum cleaner.I wouldn't advise doing this if you can't reduce your vacuum cleaner to a low power as of full power you risk overheating and damaging the vacuum cleaner with prolonged use.
How to open a frozen padlock
Another option building on the heat line of thoughts, is to use one or two plastic bags filled with warm water, and then put these in contact with the padlock, i.e. one on either side. Leave for a few minutes, and the padlock should have thawed and be easily opened again!
How to turn off the lights without getting out of bed?
Use a long stick. You might have to build up your arm strength to hold it depending on how far your stick will reach.If the switch you are flipping is a toggle style, then moving the remote end of the stick will change the switch.If the switch you are flipping is a rotary style (think lamp twist switch), you can use tape attach the stick to the switch.  This method may leave the stick where it is a hazard to passersby.  Mark your stick responsibly where appropriate.
How can i clean my car seats that is made of fabric?
Get a stiff brush with lots of plastic bristles, one that has a corner so you can get into corners easier.Small section at a time brush in a circular motion, not rough as it will pull the fibers and make it look webby, try to break the dirt loose. Then with a vacuum go over the area brushed to see if it removed the dirt.More than likely you will need to use a shampooing agent, carpet cleaner works great, I usually opt in for one with enzymes in it to kill any smell. They sell these at most hardware stores. While you're there, also get a spray bottle for the cleaning agent. Mix to your ratio and spray it on lightly, you don't want to soak it but you want to get the very base of the fabric. Try a small hidden area first to make sure it wont bleach your fabric. Use the brush to gently foam it, then vacuum with shop vac.Let it air dry in the sun with windows rolled down. If its night or cold, you can stick a corded heater in the car with windows slightly cracked.
How to remove critters from car?
I'm not certain this will work, but you could park your car in bright sun on a hot day for the whole day. It should heat up and cause the critters to either flee or die.
How to remove critters from car?
I believe that first of all you should have a thorough carwash. Then let it be in the sun to dry. There are some insecticides in solid form that can be placed at different locations inside car which have less odour. You can also place camphor at different locations as it also repels ants and many insects. The only thing is it is imflammable but I don't think it will mean a lot when properly placed. Moreover camphor has sweet smell and is also good for health. Camphor also acts as biopesticide. *Leave a few tea bags of mint tea near area where the ants seem most active.Dry crushed mint leaves or cloves also work as ant deterrents. *Usage of diatomaceous earth could be very effective method and you would find coackroaches dying within 48 hours.Keep this in car and also sprinkle it in appropriate locations. *Mix 1 litre water,one teaspoon of borax and a cup of sugar.Soak cotton balls in the solution and place them in containers containing hole in lid.Ants will carry it back and eventually kill their colony.
How to remove critters from car?
You need to find out how they are getting in. Cars should be able to keep bugs out unless the windows/doors are open. If those are closed and you still get bugs you need to figure out where they are getting in or they'll keep appearing. If you've got a rust problem creating holes, you can get expanding foam insulation to fill the holes and keep them out. 
How to remove critters from car?
First, you have to remove whatever is attracting the bugs. Insects don't colonize your car because they like to annoy you; they do so because there's something inside which they like (probably that they consume). So, if your kid's been spilling Jolt on the upholstery, you'll need to clean out all that sugar (I'm guessing the critters don't go for the caffeine). And, while you're at it, clean the whole car.Second, there are passive bug traps that may do what you need (e.g. Roach Motels). Tape a few down under the seats, and check them in a week. If there's nobody home, throw them out and declare victory; if there is, then replace them.Third, if you still have problems, you may have to bend your "no pesticide" rule. Camphor explicitly works by smell, so you may want to avoid that. But, if you selectively spray in critical areas (e.g. edges of carpet) then you may get what you want without too much odor. And then, leave the car windows open to get the smell out.
Removing soot and smoke smell after a house fire
Seeing that there was no response to this question I did a google search for remove smell after house fire which lists some alternatives as to how to handle the smell after a fire. However none of the solutions seems to be quick and easy, or does guarantee anything.A summary of what to do related to different areas affected by smoke are as follows:Ventilate as much as possible — If available use extra fans to build a little overpressure and circulate the air throughout the houseWash walls, surfaces, cupboards, ... — using either vinegar solutions, normal detergents, dish soap, or even careful usage of trisodium phosphateLeave stuff to pick up the odour — plain charcoal, bowls of vinegar, coffe powder, (heavy) incenseBaking soda and vacuum — For carpets and furniture, sprinkle baking soda on them, leave overnight and vacuum (preferably with a vacuum with HEPA filter)Wash clothes — possibly repeat washing cycle (before drying clothes) with combinations of detergents, vinegar and washing sodaOzone treatment — Do be aware that some consider this experimental, and there are risks involvedEven after doing all of these, then there seems to a general concensus that you do need time, and you'll reduce the smell but it is hard to remove it.Some of the articles which I've based this answer upon are these: I can't get the smell of smoke (from a fire) out of my house!Removing Smoke Odor After a House FireHow do I Remove Fire Smoke Smell From Apartment?How to Naturally Remove Smoke Smells After a FireOzone Generators that are Sold as Air Cleaners
Attaching plastic rods to midsole of a shoe
Be wary of the lack of traction if you attach it to the bottom of the sole. Cut a slit in the heel and slip it under the insole. Secure it using the pull strap and the top eyelets with some lace. Hot-glue might work to keep the bottom in place.
how can I rinse off quickly in the shower?
Try using far less soap.  We moved from a hard to a soft water area and found that the amount of soap required to form a lather was significantly less in soft water than hard.
How to open a frozen padlock
If you are miles from anywhere and you don't have anything with you described above and your survival depends on what's on the other side of the door there is a fairly unsavory way to thaw the lock to allow you to operate it; urinate on it.  It's not pleasant but it will raise the temperature of the padlock and thaw any ice in the mechanism.
how can I rinse off quickly in the shower?
I know exactly what you mean. I was the same when I first installed a water softener, I never felt as though the soap was rinsed off me. After a while, you will start to accept that the soap is actually gone .I also experienced the same thing regarding soap in my eyes, but that was just because I was using too much soap, you need far less with softened water. Again, you will get used to this over time.EDIT: if you really want to rinse yourself in hard water, you could try taking a bucket into the shower which you have filled from the COLD KITCHEN TAP as this is unlikely to be supplied from the softener.
Seal a window Temporarily (in monsoons)
Use water proof gaffer tape. This is a very strong binding tape that will keep out water. The difference between gaffer tape and Duct tape is it is slightly more expensive, however the adhesive element won't leave a residue on the window which can happen with Duct Tape.Based on your description this should hold up as a temporary measure, and it is easily removed when the weathers nice. Hope this helps. Rossco 
What is the best way to get rid of steam on a mirror?
Keep a space heater on underneath the mirror.  Make sure it's on before you start showering.This is in some ways a variant of the blow dryer answers.
How to clean crevices of electronics without compressed air?
Depending on how the crevice to clean is shaped, an old (but reasonably clean) toothbrush can work quite well.This seems to work well on the narrow spaces where plastic pieces come together, or decorative grooves in a device, where dirt or dust sometimes builds up.
How to protect computer from accidentally pressing the power button?
If the plastic of the button is thick enough, one could make a recessed power button.This could be done by taking apart the button and, using either a sander or something like a dremel tool, cutting/sanding down the top off the button's (moving) plastic partWhen reassembled, the result would be a recessed power button, which would be more difficult to press accidentally, but would still be fully functional.
How can I boost my wifi range?
I notice that the appartment is two floors above the router.Because of the way the radio signal is emitted from the antenna, almost none of it goes straight up if the antenna is vertical. (One trick to visualise where most of the signal goes is to imagine a donut threaded onto the antenna. No signal at the ends of the antenna, but all around the sides, good signal.)This means that you must point the side of the antenna towards the direction in which you want to have the best signal. In this case, that would mean setting up the antenna so it's almost parallel to the ground.This will work with any router which has a positionable antenna. Plus, it's free!A note about multiple antennas: place the antennas at 90 degrees from eachother, in a "V" shape, to get the best overall coverage, since each antenna will be covering the other's "dead zone".I hope this helps :-)
Make coffee with no coffee filters?
You could try cutting an old sock that has a loose weave (the type your grandmother gives you that never fits anyway). Tie it off with a rubber band or hair scunci, then push it down and shape it in the coffee tray.  Essentially it would make a large tea bag. This has worked great for me.
How to turn off the lights without getting out of bed?
My solution is to use a lamp with a Tabletop Dimmer, for my lamp that is not within reach of the bed.  I bought one for my grandad when he was 95.  The device works like a 'switch extension'.  It plugs into a wall outlet (mine is operated with a wall switch, which I turn off when I'm not in the room), & the lamp plugs into the back of it.  For folks with poor eyesight, like me, it can be dimmed to provide just enough watts to act as a nightlight.
How to turn off the lights without getting out of bed?
Another day, another idea (or two):Light Sensor LampIf carefully placed you could have a lamp/bulb with light sensor, so that when you are entering the room, or leaving the bed the sensor triggers and lights up the room. Do be aware so not let the sensor trigger when you are in bed and move at night.I used a LED flashlight with light sensor like this in an adjoining room to my bedroom which I had to cross to get to the batroom. When triggered it stayed on for approx 30 secs, which gave me enough time to cross the room. In addition in case of power failure, it would light up for a minute allowing me to find the light and use it as an emergency flashlight.
How to turn off the lights without getting out of bed?
Another day, another idea (or two):Clapper Switch for LightsSome years make it was very fashionable to use clap on/clap off lights. This could possibly also be an interesting variation over the remote control light option. (That is as long as you don't have a partner which would be awakened by you clapping... )

Any affordable technology to detect things in a paper box?
I kind of like the lifehack comment. So, you could always try a toluene-infused object identification instrument:Then put numbers on the boxes, and on the backs of photos of what's in the boxes (so you'd also use a good old-fashioned camera, or a new fangled digital one, whichever):And if you wanted to go a step further, you could probably even find a free or cheap little stuff-tracking database program on the Web that would let you attach digital photos of the contents of the boxes to the numbers that you write on the boxes, or get a copy of something like Access or Filemaker Pro and create your own:

I'm not sure if there is prebuilt hardware to accomplish your task but take a look at RFID (the father of NFC) solutions.  RFID usually can work up to a few feet at least.
What is a good makeshift bookend?
You could make them from cardboard boxes. Cut away material from the box so that it has 3 side. These will be a bottom side, a rear side and a left/right side. The books will weigh down the bottom side, whilst the left/right side is supported by the rear side. In effect it's like a standar L-shaped bookend, but with rear bracing to compensate for the flimsy material.
Best way to clean or shine a silver jewelry
The professional way to clean jewellery is to use an ultrasonic bath.  The vibration releases the dirt particles from the smallest recesses of the jewellery.To do this as a hack you need to replicate the vibration as best you can.Place the jewellery in a small dish and cover it with water in which you add a small amount of washing up liquid.  This now needs to be vibrated.  Good sources of vibration about the house would include a washing machine on a spin cycle or a loudspeaker.  Obviously you need to take care that no spillage of the liquid can occur and the dish doesn't slide off onto the floor.Leave the dish to vibrate for 15-20 minutes and rinse off the jewellery.This should remove much of the dirt.  No scrubbing or brushing has taken place.  This works for any metal, not just silver.

How to smooth out scratched leather?
You may use olive oil, baby oil, or saddle oil. After applying it to the scratch, buff it maybe for an hour. This will allow color from the nearby spot to spread. This method is good for deeply pigmented leather.  You could also use a damp cloth. Place it over the scratch and iron it for about 10 seconds. If the method doesn't work, you may like to try a second time. This method is applicable to leather of aniline type and I don't know whether it is banned in your country. Also it will bring out natural oil in leather.  Another method is that you can dye it using shoe polish of same shade.  You can also use a warm blower and buff on that area. Not too warm, as that may damage the leather. Use your hand to justify.
How to better clean the inside of my car's windshield?
If you have a grease built up on a window, the easiest thing to do is put some dish soap on a cloth and wipe it down. Dish soap is perfect for cutting through dirt and grime. Once you have the tough stuff removed, you'll need to use the Windex and lots of paper towels or, better yet, shop towels. I far prefer shop towels for cleaning my windshield on the inside because they are extremely tough and don't leave fibers. I personally can't stand using microfiber cloths on the interior windows in my car; they dirty too quick and end up just smearing the film around.
How to differentiate glass from plastic?
You won't require Scratching it, just tap it with finger nail and you will know by the sound what is it.A light plastic me produce a pop sound.Glass would be hard and will produce a tunnn sound or no sound at all.Hard plastic will be dull sound unlike glass.
How to differentiate glass from plastic?
Glass will be colder than plastic when you touch it. In addition, glass will warm up more slowly from the heat of your hand, whereas plastic will reach the same temperature as your hand within a few seconds.
Can I use carpet underlay for the purpose of making a rug thicker?
You need to be careful with what you put under a rug because you can reduce the friction between the back of the rug and the floor. If you use underlay, you would need to ATTACH it to the rug and have the tackiest side in contact with the floor. I would imagine a few stitches or some Carpet Tape would be good enough to fix it.You can buy rug non-slip material, I would put this between the underlay and the floor to improve the friction.
How to apply sunscreen to my back
Take a spare towel that you can stretch across your back. Apply liberal amounts of sunscreen to the towel. Rub the sunscreen into your back using the pressure of keeping the towel tight across your back. If you have skin folds, you may have to work at getting into the crevices.
How best to prolong the shelf life of eggs?
Turning eggs upside down once a week keeps eggs staying fresh much longer - at least two months (by which time I'm all out of eggs). In order to remember whether I've turned them, I put a mark on the top of the eggs when I buy them and turn them each weekend. I have only tried this with refrigerated eggs but I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work with eggs at room temperature either...
How to apply sunscreen to my back
You mentioned spray sunscreen. It seems as though the spray should work well.Make sure there's little or no wind. Shelter yourself behind a car or building if needed.Hold the spray canister in your right hand.Reach up over your right shoulder and spray down the center of your back.Move your hand over your head so it's over your left shoulder.  Spray down diagonally over your back.Reach up underneath your left arm and spray across your lower back.Hold the spray canister in your left hand, and repeat the mirror image of the three spraying steps.The first time you do it should be with a friend, even at home when there's no sun. They can confirm that you covered your whole back.This technique is probably wasteful, as much of the spray will just go into the air. But it should cover your back fairly completely.It's worth noting that beaches should set up areas where solo people can gather and spray each others' backs. You can't be the only one with this challenge.
How to differentiate glass from plastic?
This is what I have learned from experience.Glass and stone are cold. Plastic is warm.Now, obviously; there would be some exceptions like if the plastic were outside when it was quite cold while the glass was inside and warm. So; they will need to be around the same temperature. As far as exact technique, I typically just hold the object in my hand for a few seconds (or at least have my skin against it); the plastic will warm to my hand almost immediately (and eventually you will probably sweat). However, glass will feel much colder.I'm planning to find a link to back me up on this. However, for now I will just leave it at the fact that I have been making jewelry for a while now and when I get a rag-tag box of beads from someone, this is how I tell whether they are glass (or stone) or not. Edit:Here is a link to an E-Bay quick guide on knowing if a bead is glass or plastic.(This will work with larger objects such as what you have as well).
How to apply sunscreen to my back
I've seen pump sprays that work upside down or upright (the stem has openings at each end with little metal balls, oriented in opposite directions)This is much easier to spray reaching back over your shoulder. A pump that only work upright has a work-around: bend forward so your back is horizontal, then reach up and spray parallel to your back.
How to apply sunscreen to my back
Why not ask (politely, of course) for someone to do it ? Actually this is a pretty standard way to engage in a nice conversation or, perhaps, something else, at least here in Brazil.The trick is to behave naturally. If all you want is the suncreen, then I´d suggest to look for a group of parents/grandparents with kids. Opting for sprays also reduces a lot any chance of being rejected.

Remove the battery as that may cause short circuiting, secondly just open up the phone and keep it in dry rice it absorbs moisture, if you can open up the phone more, do it and try to blow it in order to remove any condensed salt particles as they are conducting and may cause a short circuit.  If it still dosent work,  well gift her a new phone :p
Best way to focus on my task without getting distracted
I’m guessing that by ‘ads’ you mean some sort of attention deficit and/or hyperactivity disorder?Could you talk to your boss about maybe taking several short breaks throughout the day rather than a single, long break?  You could use those short breaks to deal with distractions such as chatting to people, also maybe take a bit of exercise, then you may find yourself better able to concentrate while you are working.Also, if possible, arrange your work so that you have more than one task on the go at a time.  That way you can switch back and forth between them rather than trying to focus all day on a single task and getting mentally fatigued.
How to find my way without a compass?
You can orient yourself without technology in a number of ways:moss grows on the north side of the tree (in the northern hemisphere)the sun travels from east to west — if you know what time it is (roughly), you can roughly determine north based on the line perpendicular to the arc of the sun's pathat night, look for the Big Dipper — the two stars on the end of the scoop point to Polaris (the north star)If you are lacking a map, simply knowing your orientation will likely not help you much. Look for landmarks or other points of interest in order to help determine which way you should head to find your way back. Any stream that you may have crossed is a good starting point since they are usually quite long and can divide the area into "home side" and "lost side". If you crossed a stream only once, you're not on the "home side".
How to find my way without a compass?
The simple way is not to become lost in the first place.  Stay aware of the shape of the land around you, and keep landmarks in your head.  Where is the sun?  Did you go up or down a slope from your camp?  And so on...Unless you are on bare rock or hard-packed dirt, you'll have probably left some footmarks on the ground, so back-track on those.  If you walked through deep grass, you'll have bent it down and left a track.  And so on, with variations depending on your local terrain.
How to apply sunscreen to my back
If you want to use lotion - put some on the BACK of your hands. You can rub it into your back using the backs of your hands and the top of your forearms. Doing it like this instead of trying to use your hands normally, you won't be trying to twist your wrists in some unnatural way to reach further up into your back. Try it - you'll be surprised how much more natural it feels and how much further you can reach without straining.

Things you'll need: a needle, a bit paper, and some water. Rub the needle on your hair and pour some water on a cup. Place the bit paper on the surface of the water. Now place the needle on the paper. The needle now turns and shows the north direction. Concept: Static ElectricitySource: Bear Grylls
How to find my way without a compass?
This article pretty much explains how to build a compass with everyday things. Here is a summary with some additions:The principleLet a magnetised metallic "needle" float on some still water.Step by stepCreate a still surface of water with a large enough opening to put something on it. You could for example use a hat, a hole in the groud, some carved piece of wood.Find something light that will float on it. The article speaks about a slice of a cork but you don't usually have that with you. I would rather use a leaf, some piece of paper (that won't soak too fast) or plastic, a very small piece of wood. It should be light and flat.Get a metallic "needle-ish" thingy. Could be an actual needle, a watch needle, a belt buccle needle,... It should be metallic as you'll need to magetize it.Magnetize the thing by rubbing it against an actual magnet, some fur, silk or even your own hair.Put the needle on the floating thing. If you did well it will rotate until indicating a north-south direction.Identify the North using any trick from other answers here. Technique in the article is more elaborate but technically if you happen to see the sun it's not that hard to figure out. Sun moves from east to west.Move on and bring that wood back :-)Here you go !
Cheap way to hang a poster without frame
I am particularly fond of using thumb tacks to hang objects. They have multiple uses and are removable. The only downside is that it will leave a tiny hole in the poster. I recommend of course using clear so that no colors are distracting from the poster's image. Depending on what type of frame you have, you can thumb tac the poster to the wooden frame in the top two corners, and then use another 1,2, or 3 thumb tacks (depending on weight) to hang the wooden frame. This all depends on weight. If you want to get creative, you can take some durable string or fabric cut into a strand and use it with the thumb tacks for a neat effect. It is all about weight balancing. 
Can I use carpet underlay for the purpose of making a rug thicker?
If you are looking for something to make the carpet thicker, thus making it softer for children, an underlayment is not what you need.  An underlayment is a thin foam sheet that is typically used underneath wood flooring.  What you are going to need to look for is a rug pad.  If you go to your local home improvement store and ask their flooring department, they will show you the difference in the two products.  The underlayment comes in long rolls and is a thin foam material; whereas carpet padding is typically sold in pre-measured square foot sections (ie. 6'x8' section) or some stores may custom cut a pad for you if you would like them to (this could cost you a little more).  The carpet padding comes in lots of different sizes and lots of different thicknesses, so you can determine what is best for your family.  If you are unsure of these two options, you can research the two terms on the home depot website; it will give you more clarity on both products.  I have used carpet padding, and it makes quite a difference in the softness of the rug.  I will also tell you that @lefty is absolutely correct in that you need to use some type of carpet tape or adhesive to adhere the carpet padding to the rug.  Some padding has one side with a rubber grip on it, and this is the side you put on the floor to keep it in place.  If it does not, use the carpet tape on the padding as well to adhere it to the floor so that it does not move around while your kids are playing on the carpet - otherwise it will happen, and they will fall; it happened to my daughter, and then we went out and bought 2 rolls of carpet tape.
How to better clean the inside of my car's windshield?
I've used dish soap before, and it did ok but you still have to go back over it with the windex.  I've actually found that using vinegar on windows has worked quite well.  I use it with the shop towels, as they don't leave the fibers behind that traditional paper towels do.  You can pick them up at any auto parts store, or even Wal-Mart (they're the blue towels in the auto section).  The vinegar cuts through the grime, and then I also like to go over it with the Rain-X product because it helps to prevent the glass from fogging up in the winter.  I've also found that in using the rain-x, I don't have to clean my windows as often - a nice little bonus for me, as I absolutely hate cleaning my car....I try to get my kids to do it, and sometimes bribe them  ;) 
How to find my way without a compass?
Your watch and the sun make a perfect compass!First, you need to make sure your watch is set to normal/winter/non-daylight-saving time. (You don't have to actually change its time, just keep in mind that during the summer months, you might have to subtract one hour, depending on your country's time politics...)Then, hold the watch flat and let the hour clock hand (or where it would be without daylight-saving time) point to the sun.After that, look where the 12 o'clock label points.If you now take the direction in between of 12 o'clock and your current clock hand's direction, this is the south!Example:It's 8PM (20:00) and summer in a country using daylight-saving time, so the normal time would be 7PM (19:00). We let the 7 o'clock label point to the sun's position. The south is where the 3:30 label would point to (if we had one ;D), because that's the time in the middle of 12 o'clock and 7 o'clock.
How to avoid tripping a breaker
As you suggest, it is probably possible to rewire a standard current-sensing power strip so that the slave outlet is turned off when the master (microwave) outlet is drawing current. Most relays have single-pole-double-throw (SPDT) contacts, and switching the slave connection to the other side would work as desired.If you'd rather make your own switch, a schematic from Elliott Sound Products should work. You could put a pilot lamp on the 12-v portion of the circuit to warn when the microwave can't be used, or just leave it out.One possible issue, though: if the microwave starts while the fridge compressor is already running, back-pressure builds while the fridge is off and it might require a few minutes delay before restarting the motor. Repeatedly switching a fridge compressor motor on and off (short-cycling) can damage it; so add a large capacitor across the base and emitter of Q1 and a diode in series with the base to act as an ON time delay.

Cheap way to hang a poster without frame
I have had great success in the past using binder/bulldog clips. The larger the poster, the larger the clips need to be (and/or more need to be used) but I have found that simply clipping a couple to the top of the poster works very well -- the 'wire' part of the clip can then be hung on a nail or similar, with no need for a frame. If the poster doesn't hang perfectly straight, you can use an additional clip at the bottom to 'weight' it.The only risk from this method is a little creasing around where the clip 'bites' but I expect that would be less bad than marks left by tape.
How do I protect small objects?
You have conflicting needs: For useful fire protection, something like an inexpensive (~20€) fire safe that "withstands temperatures up to 1550° for up to 30 minutes" would be needed, but that makes its contents seem more valuable to thieves. Any safe that would also deter thieves (~200€) would be an order of magnitude more costly, but if it's movable, a determined thief could take it. (Thieves even will pull apart walls to strip copper wire and pipe.)The transparency requirement is incompatible with fire protection because heat transmitted by radiation would destroy the contents. You could put a photo of the objects on the container, though. However, if transparency is of prime importance, you could seal the object(s) in fused quartz or, better, sapphire (fused aluminium oxide).So pick the most important criteria to you and select something that fits.
Make icepacks for a coolbag/coolbox
Use a mixture to modify the water's propertiesYou could use an antifreeze/water mixture that you put in a bottle. You will have a much lower freezing and higher boiling point that just water. This will allow you to keep your frozen packs at a lower temperature than plain ice for longer.Safety ConcernsYou will also need to be extremely careful with antifreeze around food and/or drinks as it is toxic to almost all mammals. Other creatures may also have toxic reactions to the antifreeze.  Insure that if you use a recycled water bottle that it is extremely difficult (aim for impossible) for you and/or children to get into it.OptionsYou could also try using alcohol instead of water. It is the same principle as mixing antifreeze with water.  It is also much safer than antifreeze, but you will still need to modify the bottle to prevent child access.
Make icepacks for a coolbag/coolbox
Insulate your cooler more effectively.You didn't mention what type of cooler you are using, so I am guessing that you have a standard injection molded plastic cooler. If you have Styrofoam, then this answer won't work for you.Drill a hole into the injection molded plastic at one corner so that your hole makes it between the layers of plastic.  On the opposite corner, drill another hole so that will allow air to escape.  Buy a can of insulating spray foam at your favorite hardware store.  Following the instructions on the can, spray the foam into either of the holes you drilled previously.  Once you have foam flowing out the other hole, you will want to rotate the cooler to get the foam in as many places internally as possible.  Use the quick curing foam so you don't have to tape the holes closed.  Let it sit as per the instructions on the can.If you find that you have missed sections of the cooler, you can always drill more holes and repeat the steps as necessary.
Make coffee with no coffee filters?
cupcake cups.  Trying it right now.  Typed this into google and I'm out of paper towels and found some cupcake cups in two different styles.  Plain white and Disney's Frozen Elsa styled cups. I chose to use the plain white of course. Don't need all that extra dye. Not a coffee drinker, but I make a sheet cake that calls for it.  
Make icepacks for a coolbag/coolbox
I've never done this myself, but I've camped with people who have used dry ice to keep things cold/frozen over the course of four days.Dry ice is much colder than regular ice, so you may actually have to insulate things you don't want to freeze from it.  Keep it at the bottom of the bag, or maybe move it to the top if it isn't cooling as much.It's a bad idea to hold dry ice with your hands, so think about plastic bags and tongs.I would also say that dry ice is a "slower" coolant, so try not to open your cooler as much.

Tumble-drying a fitted sheet without getting other things tangled in it
My Panasonic condenser dryer tangles my bedding up and drives me mad.  Having read lots of things on the internet about how to stop this I have found this to work. Firstly. Don't put your fitted sheets in the dryer with the other items - they seem to be the worst culprits for tangling everything into a ball. I now put the duvet cover (fasten the poppers/buttons before washing to stop smaller items going inside) and the pillow cases in the dryer with 2 largish DRY towels. This means you are not having to pay any extra to dry the towels and the weight of them keeps the bedding separated enough to dry it and no tangles. I hang the fitted sheets on a clothes horse and wait until they're almost dry and then add them to the dryer with the rest of the bedding and towels for a 30 minute warm cycle. Works for me and I no longer dread bedding washing day!
How to label socks
It would still be some work, but maybe sewing a colored thread, just a few stitches, could do the trick. This would have the added benefit of not fading when being washed. And you could give each family member its own color (or possibly two; one for light colored socks,  and one for dark colored socks). 
How to label socks
A bleach pen may work, though the bleach would have the tendency to "bleed" (wick).  You would probably not be able to write very clearly, if at all.  A dot or "X" may be the only design you could make.
Best way to clean loafers?
Wash stained loafers with mild dish detergent mixed with water. Using a soft toothbrush, scoop up a small amount of suds and apply them to the stain, keeping the shoes as dry as possible. Gently scrub the mark with the toothbrush and let the mixture sit for a few minutes before wiping it away. If any stain remains, repeat the process.
How do I protect small objects?
As stated in another answer you are listing conflicting parameters, and need to decide for yourself how important those are when put up against each other. My take on answering your question would be to suggest two different approaches based on different  aspects of your requirements. Bank deposit boxIf these items are really precious to you,  and you really want to keep them out of harms way, i.e. fire, earth quake, and so on, you should consider renting a bank deposit box. Most other solutions achievable in a home will only tempt burglars and thiefs, be insuperior to the bank box or will put your stuff at some risk  with regards to natural hazards. Plastic boxesIf however you want them accessible, and don't focus on events which really are out of your hands anyway, then storing the items in plastic boxes could be a good solution. They could be see through, have a simple locking mechanism to keep box shut and water proof, capable of handling falling down, and in general they are quite durable. They are also easily movable in case of emergency. Plastic box(es) should handle both earth quakes, and water damage from fire elsewhere in building (that is water damage), and attract little attention from the bad guys. 
Eliminate smoke smell from BBQ out of clothing
I do a lot of grilling for friends who don't appreciate the smell of a fine grill smoke. I have a bottle of Febreze Heavy Duty fabric refresher that I spray my clothes down with post-grilling. It seems to get the smell down to a level that doesn't bother others.I also keep an extra set of clothes with me in the car if I BBQ away from home. It's good practice anyway, imho.
How to label socks
Try iron-on labels. They are similar to your printed labels, only it takes a fraction of the time to iron on a label than to sew on a label!Many people feel that sewed on labels are longer lasting, yet if you use an iron at the correct temperature and keep the iron on the garment for the proper duration, the "glue" in the back of the label will properly adhere to the garment and you will find that it will stay there for quite some time.This link gives directions and explains how to use such labels.
Turn Smartphone into Headlamp
Use a sweatband, bandanna, or rope to make an improvised sling. Place you phone between your head and the sling.Very crude drawing showing how to use the sling and phone
Turn Smartphone into Headlamp
As a smart phone is somewhat bigger than what would easily fit to my head, you could try attaching it to the upper part of your chest using a belt or a rope.It will not be as flexible as when attached to the head, but it is easier to fasten more securely. And for most work, it will provide good lighting on your work area.There does exist straps made for pulse measuring devices and/or action cameras for the chest area, although I haven't seen it for smart phones. These could possibly be adapted to work. I've only seen holders for the upper arm for smart phones. 
Easy way to crush beans / peanuts?
Besides from the blender you already mentioned, you can put the peanuts onto a dishcloth and then take the edges and fold it so the nuts can't fall out. Then you just take a hammer or something similar and hit the peanuts inside the dishcloth until they have the size you want them to. For the beans you could use a plastic bag as well and probably shouldn't hit as hard as with the peanuts. Works also great, if you want to get rid of any kind of aggressions. Don't know what you mean with mongo though... Hope this helps (P.S. sry if my english isn't 100% correct... not a native Speaker)
Easy way to crush beans / peanuts?
You could put the beans in a large bag and spread them out on a table surface. You could then either use somethign such as :rolling pin to roll over themwooden breadboard and lean your weight on itEnsure you leave enough 'bag space' so that the bag doesn't burst as you squash the beans
Easy way to crush beans / peanuts?
If you have cooked beans, a fork and bowl will do the job.A Mortar and Pestle could work for something harder like peanuts, or dry beans. The Mortar usually a heavy stone or ceramic bowl (or vessel - they can be large) and the pestle is a heavy club shaped tool used to mash the contents of the mortar.  
Things that I can use in my office to remove the strong smell in my tumbler
Baking soda is the usual goto for this, but if you are at the office this might be difficult to procure.If you have a cafeteria with a salad bar, you might be able to rinse with a 50/50 vinegar/water solution which should help (red or white vinegar, not balsamic).I've used the hand soap to clean my cup and get rid of a large portion of the smell.
Easy way to crush beans / peanuts?
What is the end goal of crushing these beans / nuts? If you're looking for a "paste", then I suggest a food processor. If you are looking to just chop a small quantity, you could use an electric coffee grinder for all sorts of seeds, nuts, and herbs,  like so:coffee grinder http://www.tlbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Coffee-Grinder.jpgSee: if I put peanuts in a coffee grinder will I get powder or paste?Ultimately, if you're dealing with more than a couple hundred grams of beans/nuts, you'll want a food-processor. It will do the job really well, and allow you to even make a butter/paste. 
Things that I can use in my office to remove the strong smell in my tumbler
Household soda crystals should work - one level dessertspoonful in the beaker, top up with boiling water, leave till its completely cool, empty out, rinse and wash thoroughly.I mean these things:http://www.msodistributing.com/soda_crystals.htmlif you can get something like it where you are. As you're not 100% certain what its made of, keep an eye on it, in case the solution starts to damage the material of the beaker.
How to fix zipper?
The zipper goes bad when the handle bends/abrading, orthe zip is abradingMost of the cases the handle can be squeezed a bit with pinchers and put some wax on the zip also can help.But these are temporary solutions, the whole zipper needed to replace by a seamstress as soon as possible.
How can I hang a picture without being able to drive nails/hooks into the wall?
Many different types of adhesives can be very useful in this situation. Something that I've seen used a lot is adhesive putty also known as sticky tack. Adhesive putty is a bunch of small strips of a sticky substance a bit like dough that is commonly used to hold things up. You'll want to roll them up in little balls, then stick them on the corners of the photo frame, then put it on the walls. You may need to add the putty in more places if the picture is too heavy.
How can I hang a picture without being able to drive nails/hooks into the wall?
In this answer I describe various alternatives for how to hang something on a wall.In your case you might need something tolerating a heavier load, and my suggestion to you is that if you have wooden lists in the roof you could possible attach nails either to the list itself or wedged in between the list and the wall or roof. Then you attach strings to the nails and hang your picture from these. This method will leave virtually no marks and should be allowed by your current lease options.

How i join a group of my classmates?
Stop over-thinking it and just join them.  You have a common interest already in that you are all at the same institution, just join in the conversation.My grandfather gave me some advice which always seems to work.  Listen to a conversation where a number of people are all talking about the same thing.  They will all have their own view point.  If you weight everything up and then, when there is a gap in the conversation, jump in with a fairly short comment that basically summarizes what everyone had just been talking about, typically everyone will agree and some even say "Oh yes, that's exactly the point I was making."  Don't say too much :-)Remember, if someone seems to have a problem with you; it's their problem.  Everybody wants to be liked and have friends, everybody worries about it, some realize sooner than others that you just need to get involved.Don't get hung up in what happened in the past because, no matter how much you think on it, you can't do anything about it other than learn from it.Good luck and remember; be bold.
Turn Smartphone into Headlamp
You CAN turn a smartphone into a headlamp if you want to.  Question if it's a good idea though.  A headlamp can be purchased cheaply and if it comes damaged whilst working on a vehicle, you can buy another cheaply.  I don't know what smartphone you have but I know that mine would cost hundreds to replace so whilst you CAN use it in this way, I personally wouldn't.
Can't cut my hair with clippers and I have no scissors. Any other solutions?
If your hair clipper works on rechargeable battery then you may like to try changing the battery to a slightly higher voltage like from 1.2V to 1.5V.It is effective and whenever I had tried with the one I have,I found it to work as per my expectations.The only problem I can find is its compatibility with the circuit.Even after that you can make it compatible keeping in view the type if clipper you have got.
Can't cut my hair with clippers and I have no scissors. Any other solutions?
Make sure you've oiled the blades with clipper oil and that you've adjusted the cut height correctly (usually a little arm on the side or a screw to do this).  I personally find that my clippers work better before I've washed my hair.It may be that you need the blades sharpened.  There are service centres which will offer this service.
How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?
One way I have tried and became successful many times is by analysis of behaviour of mosquitoes.Mosquitoes try to hide in areas such as shelf,almirah,beneath desks.Now you can create a situation for them.In light open the almirah a bit such that light slightly crosses the almirah.You may find mosquitoes usually sitting there.Dont waste time if you want to kill.Stamp them.In shelves in one of the corners pile some waste like old boxes and bags.It acts as suitable place for mosquitoes to hide.When you air it you will find it flying.If two three days have passed by and the mosquito is frustrating you.At the final day close the light and wait for the mosquito to arrive near your bed.Do what you want with him.

Technically, this isn't "hanging" a picture, but if your goal is to display pictures or artwork up against to wall without nail holes, an easel is another option.  
Any affordable technology to detect things in a paper box?
For paper / cardboard boxes, take a picture of the contents (either with a smartphone or camera). If you used a smartphone, print the picture in color (if possible).You can also write the names of what you stored in each box (i.e. Sharpies, pens). Or number the boxes like the above comments. Then list each number in a notepad or electronic list (i.e. on a tablet, computer). Listing each box by number would be the most efficient way to go about this.
Temporary Phone Protection
For a bumper: Depending on the phone, you could probably use thick rubber bands, layered, if necessary.For the screen/back glass: Wrap the phone in plastic wrap. It's not durable, but it's cheap, and you'll be able to use your touch screen through it. Also, it will scratch and bunch up before an offending object has a chance to scratch your screen.
How to keep something at a cool room temperature?
Tape it to the refrigerator door: it's below ambient, but not as cool as the inside. Seeing it on the door will remind you to eat it and benefit from all those antioxidants, but keep it out of reach of dogs! 
How to protect your shoes from bad smell?
In order to answer your question the first thing we need is to consider what causes your shoes in becoming bad in smell.Based on this link it states:Shoe odor is actually caused by the feet, namely, the bacteria that live on human skin. These bacteria in the sweat produced by humans are part of the body’s cooling mechanism. If you are in a tropical or warm country then this will occur to you most of the time, especially if you are doing much physical activity (e.g. exercising, running, etc.). If this is your case then you can do thisApplying antibacterials to the feet before putting on a pair of shoes can also help kill the bacteria that are on the feet. This is an option for those with particularly bad foot odor or those who are heavy sweaters.So the question now is what antibacterials can I use, right?The answer to that is GARLIC!Based on this article you can rub it in your footAjoene creams and solutions are not available commercially. But some experts recommend simply adding a few finely crushed cloves of garlic to a foot bath and soaking the affected foot for 30 minutes, or mincing a few garlic cloves, mixing the minced garlic with olive oil, and then using a cotton ball to rub some of the solution on the affected area.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
What I have heard and also successfully tried is to make your mouth full with water and cut the onions while keeping it there.It seems to work somehow and is similar to other solutions (wetting the board and knife, cutting next to steam or running water, chewing gum, ...) but not said in this form yet, I think.
How to keep something at a cool room temperature?
Take a cooler or an insulated lunchbox, put a bag of frozen vegetable of your choice (or lunchbox cooler), wrap it in a cloth (or put a cloth on top of it) and put your chocolate on top of that, then close the lunchbox. It'll be cool but not freezing.plusplus
Any affordable technology to detect things in a paper box?
Instead of printing images to go on the boxes, take a picture, make a QR code with either that image or a list of box contents here, and tape that on the box. It'll cost you less printer ink, and if you put all of them in a uniform place that is accessable when the boxes are stacked (on the side?) you can use your phone and a qr code reader app to "look" through all the boxes very quickly... and you wouldn't need to find that pesky list of "what number has which set things"
How to keep something at a cool room temperature?
Evaporative cooling would be my first choice.  In West Africa, I used to get somewhat-cool water out of an unglazed clay pot I had, just because the water would permeate through the pot and evaporate on the outside, thus cooling the pot and then the water inside.  A method like: putting chocolate in plastic bag, wrapping bag in cloth towel with ends in a bowl of water and then putting the whole thing somewhere it would get enough breeze to continuously evaporate the water should work.  I'm sure you could come up with a better method using the same basic technique.
How to protect your shoes from bad smell?
I put my shoes in the sun when they smell bad. This works well to prevent odor. The reason is that by keeping your shoes dry, you prevent bacterial growth that causes odor.If you live in a place that does not get a lot of sun, you can dry them next to a heater.Warning: Putting your shoes in the sun may affect the colors, but since your shoes are leather, I hardly believe that it would be a problem.
Can't cut my hair with clippers and I have no scissors. Any other solutions?
From cutting my son's hair, I have found that it really depends on the clipper. I don't think there is anything wrong with your hair, but if the blades are not sharp and well-oiled, it might be ineffective or even hurt a little.If you cut your own hair, it might be a good idea to invest in proper clippers and to do some maintenance on your clippers.
How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?
I too am guilty of entering into battle with a mosquito 1 on 1.... So I propose a combo of ideas, from above, that have worked for me....First, -no- You mustn't hunt the pest it must be lured to you...Second, -no- I havn't got 2 days to complete the mission...My personal choice is the racket as well (mine runs on double A's; $ 6.00 @ Walgreen); it puts you on a fair playing field;| and execution by electrocution is very validating...My personal source of fatal attraction is my ipad; the eerie glow in the otherwise total darkness seems to be truely, the forbidden fruit, irresistible for the vector to avoid, yet it crosses into the valley of the shadow of death...Well anyway, happy hunting...    
How to protect your shoes from bad smell?
Someone once told me to put tea bag in every shoe that has a bad smell, and leave it that way for a few days maybe. I don't know why, but it helps remove the smell, and also prevent it a bit (just put the same tea bag again after you take of the shoes, and keep them with the tea bag inside while not wearing them).And of course you can put talc (baby powder) in your shoes before you wear them, and it help absorb the sweat and smell.
How to protect your shoes from bad smell?
I would say that you should always wear clean socks.Do not wear the same socks twice, always clean ones.It is also important to keep your shoes dry.
How to fix zipper?
I usually use scissors to tighten up the zipper.You need to make sure it's tight enough to bring the sliders together.When it is too damaged your only option is to replace the whole zipper part.
How to protect your shoes from bad smell?
I switched to wool socks - mostly merino - a few years ago and now have very little problem with shoe / foot odor.  Wool is naturally antimicrobial and merino is very comfortable.I don't think it would solve existing shoe stink but an old grandmothers' trick is soaking them in tomato juice for a couple days.  Obviously this could have some effect on the color of shoes but it worked great on a goatskin bag I own.
How can I cut onions without tearing up?
I've found that using a high-quality, sharp knife is the best way for me not to get tears from onions.  I chop them every night at home and have no problems but when away from home (using someone else's knives) I often get tears with knives that should probably be called bludgeons for accuracy.  Use a razor blade like in Goodfellas!

How do I make sure no wire bristles are in or around my grill before I use it?
Well there are several things you could do:Use a magnet beforehand to find out if the wires are magnetic (im almost certain they are, but just to be sure). If they are, just use a strong magnet from both sides of the metal grid (where you put your food) to get all the wires stuck to the magnet and repeat this procedure until there are no wires anymore.Now if the wires are not magnetic you could try to mechanically remove the wires with water or a cleaning cloth, although I think you'd have to be thorough to be sure to get every little wire thingy ...A whole other approach would be to use somthing similar to this (just google 'alu grill bowl'). In Germany it is pretty common to use those as you don't have to worry about those wires and on top of it, you don't have to clean the grid at all. I use them every time I grill and they work pretty good and cool off in a matter of seconds after taking them off the grill (so you dont have to wait). The only downside is that that you loose a little (definitely not much) heat so the meat won't be done as fast as without it... (could be an advantage as well if you burn it often)You can build the alu bowl of (3) yourself: just take some aluminum foil, the size of your grill and fold it once(optional) and then use a toothpick or something similar and poke holes into it, this will work as a last resort but you have to watch out that it doesn't fly away when there is no food on it(bc heat rises n stuff) also the aluminum foil could stuck to your food and its awfully hard to get that off...Conclusion: I would try 1/2 first because those are the easiest ways...3 is also a good solution and avoids the whole wire problem but has some (IMO insignificant) disadvantages and 4 should as I already wrote be used as the very last resort if you don't have time to do 1/2 (or you don't have a magnet, water or a cleaning cloth.....) and don't have the alu grill bowl and want to be sure that you don't eat wiresHope this helps ;)P.S. as always: sorry if my english is not the best. I'm not a native english speaker
Cheap way to hang a poster without frame
I would use a removable spray adhesive. Super 77 seems to work well for this, but the paper can tear if the bond is too strong. Prevent this by not applying a super thick spray, and by waiting at least a minute before sticking the poster to the wall.

How do I make sure no wire bristles are in or around my grill before I use it?
Side note: If you are really worried because 6 out of who knows how many barbecued in 2011–2012 (and two before that), you might have a fear issue. This is not very likely to happen to you looking at it from a statistically point of you.However regarding your question, your best bet is simply to change away from using something with bristles to clean it. Opt for scrubs, cloths or other washing products.If you have to use a wire brush, use one of good quality and replace it when it shows significant signs of wear and tear. After using the brush on the grill, if you rinse the grill rist with running water, you will further reduce the risk of bristles. You could even dry it off with cloths.But please don't go paranoia on something which has a rather slim chance of happening.

You don't need to cool your drinks, just cool the glasses.Prepare by having enough glasses in the freezer for your friends, for every glass taken out of the freezer put a new one in so every drink is a cold drink.This is also a great way for Whiskey snobs to get cold whiskey without adding ice.
Temporary Phone Protection
For a phone case, another user suggested Sugru, but I'd like to suggest Oogoo (similar compound, just easier to procure and you get way more for less) for making a phone case. There are Oogoo variants which use bleach or glycerine, along with acrylic paint instead of cornstarch.My suggestion for doing that:Wrap the phone in plastic wrap or painter's/masking tape or a combo of both.Either find a container to place the Oogoo/Sugru into and then press the phone into that (however, the container will be mold and will shape your case). OR shape the Oogoo around the phone, which would allow you to shape around the buttons.For a screen protector, you could buy the material and cut your own, see this tutorial.
How to protect your shoes from bad smell?
I was skeptical about the use of colloidal silver solution for this, but have found by personal experimentation that it works quite well for bacterial smells.Get colloidal silver solution from a health food/natural medicine store.  If possible, it's even better and more cost-effective to make your own, but you'll need specialized equipment (not too pricy).Put it in a spray bottle and spray the inside of the shoe.  Also works on feet, underarms, and other smelly areas.You will need to reapply from time-to-time, perhaps daily.  
How to fix a keyboard with a missing leg?
From a few different angles, this is what the bottom of my standard ca.2005 "comes-free-with-the-computer" Dell wired keyboard has looked like, since I got it second-hand with one of the legs missing.That odd little doohickey on the bottom there is a 3M Command System Wire Hook (also sold as Utensil Hooks), folded the wrong way around and slightly abused into the right shape. In their normal/supported configuration, they look like this:With all due respect to the binder-clip method advocated by Oxinabox, in my experience the clips have a tendency to bend or pop out, and not actually support the keyboard all that well. They may also not lay at the proper angle, depending how the keyboard base is moulded.You'll note that my hackfoot isn't placed in the same position as the original foot — that's because it's actually being used in concert with the "official" foot on the other end of the keyboard, which is slightly taller. The shorter hackfoot, mounted a bit farther towards the keyboard's center of mass, supports the keyboard as the same angle as the original foot.It took me a bit of trial-and-error to find the correct placement for the hook, and as you can see by the fact that it's slightly bent I had to do a little "percussive adjustment" to get the fit exactly right, but the end result turned out to be amazingly stable, with absolutely no wobble at all. I was surprised myself, honestly, but I've been using it this way for years and most of the time I forget it's even there.As an added bonus, because I mounted it with a 3M Command adhesive strip, the hook is removable and recoverable whenever I decide to get rid of the keyboard. (In theory, assuming I remember. I'm the sort of person who's always having to whip out the straightened paper clip, because I forgot to eject the media from an optical drive before I disconnected the drive.)
How do I clean the bottom of a gas grill?
The bottom of most gas grills is a removable tray. It's easiest to remove it, use a 3-inch wide putty knife to scrape most of the crud off, and then use oven cleaner to remove the rest.It can still be done with some non-removable bottoms, it just takes longer to work around the burners.
How to clean the inside of a desktop computer without a vacuum
When sitting at my desk today I emptied an 1.5l plastic bottle, and by accident squeezed it a little and let go. This created a small, but efficient vacuum, which can be used to suck up dust and small debris.Went to find some dust, and the following does actually work:Squeeze the 1.5l plastic bottleMove the end close to the dust at a slight angleRelease the squeeze, and as the bottle goes back to the original shape it sucks up the dustRepeat operation, but be careful when squeezing it not to blow out the dust again :-)When executed properly it has the suction to vacuum a few peanuts! Will the computer be thoroughly cleaned? Maybe not, but you'll get most of the dust away, and the rest could be wiped away with some non-static cloth.
How to clean the inside of a desktop computer without a vacuum
Blow the dust out with compressed air OUTSIDE the building.Word for the wise:  place a soda straw or similar object between the cooling fan blades in a manner to prevent them turning, as blowing the fan with compressed air may cause the motor(s) to generate voltage and feed it back into the motherboard ...
How to remove the bhoosa [chaff] from the phool jhadu [grass broom]?
I don't know how big a phool jhadu is, but perhaps you could use a large hair comb on it. I imagine you would have to comb sections of it separately, like combing your hair (rather than being able to comb it all at once). Then shake it or hit it against a wall to get the remaining dust out.
How to clean the inside of a desktop computer without a vacuum
Go outside the building and use a fan to blow the dust away.Of course, don't make the fan too strong or this might just backfire on your computer... Use a portable fan, which are nice and small with sufficient energy but not too strong. You could also try making your own little vacuum by using suction. Use a handkerchief, put it over your mouth and suck the air in. This will suck the dust in similar to a vacuum. As a matter of fact, this was the inspiration for the first ever vacuum!   
How to remove the bhoosa [chaff] from the phool jhadu [grass broom]?
You could try using a large electric fan to blow the dust particles away. This is best done outside your home or building or you might have to re-clean the building... Since fans cool, you don't need to worry about the straw catching on fire. The strong wind should efficiently blow away all the dust in 10 to 15 minutes maximum.
How to protect your shoes from bad smell?
Not really a hack, but if you have two pairs of identical shoes and wear them on alternate days they can dry out thoroughly. This used to be a problem with some leather shoes called "Nature Trek" in the 70s. If you are in the office keep some sandals there and take your shoes off. You can put them on the windowsill if they bother you, or in front of a ventilator until they are dry.In hot weather wear sandals anyway, without socks. You can get high-tech sandals you don't need to feel ashamed about.

How to protect your shoes from bad smell?
This suggestion is going to depend on the type of liner in the shoe and the sole material. I have leather boots and boat shoes, which have cloth liners and cloth soles. My feet stink really bad to me, so when the shoes start to stink, I spray ammonia in them and let it dry out. If they really stink, I spray ammonia in them and then put the shoes and charcoal in plastic grocery bag and tie it up decently tight, but with enough air leakage to allow the ammonia to dry.Last ditch effort is to spray with ammonia, after that dries place baking soda in them for a few days, shake that out, spray in more ammonia and then place in the aforementioned bag with the charcoal.This has worked for me, but others may be leery to spray ammonia near leather, however I always keep my leather footwear oiled so the ammonia does not dry them out.

Coconut oil or unsalted butter!  The coconut oil tastes remarkably like coffee creamer, and butter is made from cream; or try putting some of each in and you'd have an ersatz bulletproof coffee! 
Things that I can use in my office to remove the strong smell in my tumbler
I don't know if this really works but I think it works for me.I just put a little amount of very hot water (you can get this from your office dispenser, or thermos) then shake my tumbler for a little while, after that you can throw away that water and notice that it doesn't smell anymore!This seems to be the most practical way when I am at the office.
Quick and dirty substitute for cream in coffee?
There's a whole world of shelf-stable milk products and milk alternatives.  Keep one or two on hand for when you run out of fresh milk.  Just be sure to rotate your stock, most last a few months.Trader Joe's sells shelf-stable whipping cream for about $1.50.  There's no weird chemicals, it's just milk and carrageenan (a thickener found in many creams) which has been Ultra High Temperature Pasteurized (UHT) and then sealed.  Also useful for baking.Horizon makes single serving UHT milk boxes, like juice boxes, which are shelf stable.  At $1 each they're a total rip off, and I've only seen them in 1%, but it's better than nothing.  I use them when camping because of the small portion size.In fact, many of the national organic milk brands in the fridge are UHT.  Horizon is one.  You can buy a half-gallon of UHT milk and keep it for three months.Any shelf-stable milk substitute will work.  Almond milk, coconut milk, coconut cream, rice milk, etc...  Go for the unsweetened varieties, you can always add sweetener.Evaporated milk comes in cans, so does sweetened condensed milk, and they keep a long time.  They're handy for baking.Buy a box of Mini Moo's, those individual serving creamers you get in diners."Bulletproof Coffee" is adding butter and maybe coconut oil to coffee.  The nutrition claims are likely a bunch of hooey, but it might cut some of the bitterness.If you're adding cream to cut the bitterness, try making better coffee.  Buy good beans and learn how to make pour over.  You can buy fancy equipment, but with a good grinder you can do it on the cheap.
Quick and dirty substitute for cream in coffee?
Hot chocolate powder can be a good substitute for creamer. It will definitely add some flavor to your coffee. I call it "poor man's mocha".
Quick and dirty substitute for cream in coffee?
Milk. Can't even imagine why you'd want to put cream (or "creamer", whatever that is) into coffee. If your coffee needs "flavour", I suggest getting better coffee.
How can I prevent my eye-glasses from becoming blurred when riding a motorcycle when raining?
Apply an automobile hard paste wax to the front of your glasses (or your helmet visor) per the usage instructions. This will keep the rain from sticking to the surface which is obscuring your vision. The "non-stick surface" you create will cause the rain to sheet off very very quickly keeping your vision essentially clear. Try it. It works.I suggest testing this out on your car windshield first. For safety reasons, this will allow you to see if the level of clarity is improved with the type/brand of wax you are using, and still have your wipers available if it doesn't. But I'll bet you see that vast improvement, even in your automobile.
How do I make sure no wire bristles are in or around my grill before I use it?
Lots of grillers will use a wire brush first, then they use a towel submerged in oil as seen on TV. So my suggestion is using a wet towel or one submerged in oil (to also help with the cooking process I believe, please help me on this one) and rub it against the area where the wire brush was used. To avoid putting your hand on super hot metal, wrap the towel into a roll and use tongs to move the towel back and forth.
Quick and dirty substitute for cream in coffee?
I wouldn't give up on the butter idea so fast -- it is fat after all.  Not sure how salted butter's salt would change the taste (maybe even make it better?)  After all, frosting would probably work and that's little more than whipped butter with a ton of sugar and some flavor.
How do I make sure no wire bristles are in or around my grill before I use it?
Keep your grill clean enough that you can see bristles.I don't know when dirty grills got popular, I think it was around the advent of the internet, but I see a lot of nasty grills. The stuff stuck on the grill is animal fat, sugar, trace amounts of carcinogens and wire bristles. Just clean all of that stuff off.I think a lot of people that that gunk is seasoning or extra flavor or something. It's not. If your meal needs to cook on that crap in order to taste proper then you are doing it wrong!
How do I clean the bottom of a gas grill?
If that area is already gunked up, get out your long rubber gloves and some oven cleaner. And a gas mask. Unhook the tank before you do any of this. If you have a complete nightmare to deal with you can remove the burners. Most grills have fairly simple connections that allow you to remove the burners. So remove the burners and anything else not connected to the grill body and get strong cleaners and a hose. Lots of cleaner and lots of rinsing will get you there.A little preventative work goes a long way - line the bottom of the grill and any pans in foil before you put food on it.
Quick and dirty substitute for cream in coffee?
If you're the baking type you may keep sweetened condensed milk. This makes a very sweet coffee (Skip the sugar!), but it's not at all bad.
How can I temporarily label storage bins
Not sure this counts as a hack, but a label maker (Brother is a prominent brand here in the US) makes labels that aren't designed to come off all that easily (certainly shouldn't brush off like a post-it or paper label), but when you're ready they peel off without too much trouble, and since they're plastic they often don't rip while removing but even if they do, they don't tend to leave the paper-covered adhesive like a paper label would.
How can I temporarily label storage bins
 You can buy these replaceable label holders which allow you to slide a small card into the slot and write whatever you like on it. You can then slide the label out and replace it as often as you see fit. Many of these are either magnetic or nailed/screwed into a drawer or cabinet face, but they are just as easily glued to any storage container you have.Sample Product Search

Blue painters masking tape. Sharpie.Blue painters tape is a paper tape like regular masking tape but it is designed to remove cleanly without leaving residue. It's probably the best solution you will find that combines solid adhesion with easy removal. Sharpie is a permanent marker. 
How can I prevent my eye-glasses from becoming blurred when riding a motorcycle when raining?
Cat crap. It's a lens cleaner and anti-fog treatment and it is safe on all lenses and great for eyewear, goggles, binoculars and helmet visors. You rub it on. And you can run it off. It sheds water and keeps your glasses from fogging. 
How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?
Get a bug zapper. I've usually seen these on porches but we stayed at a cabin in mosquitoville and naturally some mosquitoes snuck in. The first night it was bzzzz bzzzz in my ear all night. The next night I found a bug zapper and hung it inside the cabin right by the door. I never heard another mosquito at night for the next six nights.The shock-racket is cool but the bug zapper is totally passive. And by passive I mean you don't need to wake up and swing a racket around!
How to permanently banish cockroaches from the house without using any pesticide & not affecting my dog?
I recommend getting professional help. An exterminator will have pet-safe products and many will guarantee results. In other words, they come back for free until the problem is solved. There's no trick to keeping the bugs out except for methodically killing each bug, each nest, each roachie little thought needs to be killed. Fact is you could empty your house and light it on fire. When the fire department leaves the roaches will be back. Get a pro. 
How to permanently banish cockroaches from the house without using any pesticide & not affecting my dog?
Cockroaches tend to appear either when rain is near or when rain has just stopped. With that in mind, maybe your house or some places in your house are a bit too humid. Try opening windows. Another suggestion is simply to seal any unwanted crevices or openings in your house and clean profoundly. Have everything organized and don't leave things lying around. Use rat traps to help aid in killing the roaches, especially young ones. 
How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?
Killing a mosquito is easy (as you can see in the other answers). Finding it is the hard part. This is the easiest way I've found of locating a mosquito. You need 2 light sources:a small lamp that will give enough light for you to move around the room.a powerful torch (flashlight)To find a mosquito:Switch off the lights, wait until you can hear the mosquito close by.Switch on the small lamp.Switch on the torch, and hold the torch so that the light beam is parallel to the wall. If a mosquito sits on the wall in the light beam, it's easy to spot because it will cast a large shadow. If you can't find the mosquito right away, be patient. The mosquito will fly to a place where it's visible eventually.Systematically check the walls in the room. When you're hunting the mosquito, make sure not to cast a shadow on the mosquito. The sudden shadow will make the mosquito fly away.Kill using your favored method. 
How can I temporarily label storage bins
My suggestion, based on personal experience, is to go to the other way around. Make the labels permanent, and implement a system keeping track of what is in the boxes. This system could be anything from as elaborate and keeping lists of what you put into the different boxes, or as simple as taking pictures before you close the box. The key element is to have some kind of system which helps you identify in which box you have the stuff in, when you go searching in half a years time from now.I've numbered the boxes, and have a personal wiki (but this could be any text document) which I update with the contents of the boxes. I've named some of the boxes in addition to numbering them, i.e. BB01 Car - Big Blue box no 01, with car stuff, BB02 Electrical - Big Blue box no 02 with electrical stuff, SR10 - Small Red box with various items, and so on.Naming the boxes shifts the focus into permanent marking, which I find easier, and into keeping track of the content. And this latter part needs to be done anyway, as you, in my experience, never temporarily name the boxes good enough!
How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?
If your main room light is recessed and your ceiling is low enough; Turn on the light and hold your cupped hands underneath , close enough to require the bug to enter the hand trap to find its way closer to the light (careful not to get too close and burn hands or blind yourself!). Wait until the annoying creature has entered the hand cup of doom, then clap.Admittedly this is probably slower and requires more patience than some other suggestions but saves buying an electrified tennis racket or collecting a range of torches in your room.
What is the best way of cleaning the glass on a wood burning stove?
Soot is carbon particles that weren't burnt up, and will burn under the right circumstances. A good, complete combustion will burn the soot right off. Try making a fire that burns well (i.e. lots of oxygen), then there should be little to no soot left.You may need to look into whether your stove burns inefficiently if you are getting large soot deposits on the glass. If the stove burns well, it should burn off the soot itself.Large quantities of soot is an indicator (and a result of) an incomplete combustion.This may (as is often the case) be caused by too little oxygen in the stove - that is, too low airflow.
Quick and dirty substitute for cream in coffee?
Creamer is already a substitute for milk. So if you replace the creamer, replace it with milk. If you add milk though, it may cool down the coffee much, so you should heat it first. But if you do, make sure you don't boil the milk. Boiling affects the flavor of the milk badly. Make it a lukewarm, so it doesn't cool your coffee down too much, but make sure there are no bubbles.But I must say, I usually drink my coffee without any creamer or milk. A bit of sugar maybe, but a good coffee doesn't need anything else. :)
How do I clean the bottom of a gas grill?
spray it down with some generic degreaser, or soapy water.  spray it with the hose.  Be sure to get in all the crevices.  It will leave gunk under the grill, but you don't have to get dirty or scrub.
Quick and dirty substitute for cream in coffee?
I didn't see my answer, so I’m going to tell you about what I put in my coffee every morning.Unflavored “original” yogurt. Or maybe vanilla flavored.I use milk too, but I put about a tablespoon or two (I like large silverware) into my coffee and stir it. It makes a nice, thick coffee, similar to what you might get with ice cream.  My coffee is iced coffee, and I put chocolate powered and about 4 pumps of torrani syrup in there too. I top it off with ice and then head to work. This also helps me because I get those probiotics and Jamie Lee Curtis is always talking about. I buy the fancy Greek yogurts that talk about having 100 septillion live cultures, or whatever the highest count is in general, because they are always richer and have a more palatable flavor when mixed with other things.Off topic, I also use yogurt in my ranch dressing and my Alfredo sauce. 
How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?
Use a light source or water to attract bugs so that you don't have to go hunting around for them.If a quick scan of Google search results is to be believed, waving your hand slowly over a plate of water under a low light source in a darkened room should attract flying bugs quite quickly.
How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?
My way of doing it : I leave all the lights off and I go in a smaller room (usually the bathroom) and this is where I put the lights on.Then the mosquito is attracted by the light (and by myself) so it comes in the bathroom. Then I close the door and in a smaller room, it's easier to locate it and kill it !
How to permanently banish cockroaches from the house without using any pesticide & not affecting my dog?
Have you tried sticky traps ? This is how I got rid of them. There is no pesticides involved and it's pretty cheap.Like the traps here.You can also do it yourself : see this videoAs to where you could find it : I couldn't find it on amazon.in , but maybe some sellers on amazon.com can ship it to India. However, I found it easily when I was living in Asia, right next to the insects repellents. It's a pretty standard item I think, but you may have to go to bigger stores.
How can I put on contact lenses without a mirror?
Have you tried searching for solution on how to do this? Like how to put on contacts without mirror. The general consensus with small variations on which fingers to use are as follows:Clean your hands before startingUse the left hand, if right handed, to lift the upper part of the eye lidPlace contact on right middle finger. Do make sure that it is the correct wayUse either right index (or ring) finger (or both) to pull down on skin below eyeLook up with eyes only. Can be easier if you tilt chin a little downPlace contact on eye in a steady motion, and move slightly around till it sits in right positionLet go of skin around eye, start with right hand, and then left handGlance around, blink, make sure the contact is correctly seatedIf not, take it out again and repeat from topIf it is good, repeat for the other eyeDo train a few times for this at home in front of mirror, so that you don't do this for the first time when away from the mirror. Also keep a towel or some cover underneath in the start in case you drop the contact.Take care of hygiene whenever handling contacts, both when inserting or removing them.
How to clean the inside of a desktop computer without a vacuum
Another good method is to use various sizes of soft bristle paintbrushes, dependent on where you want to clean. Once the case is opened, tilt the computer at an angle holding securely in one hand,  and gently brush downwards in the areas you would like to clean with the other hand. You will find clumps of dust will drop out easily, especially in areas such as the fan, and the soft bristles of the brush won't damage anything inside.
Safe to use a fork after touching drano?
The product Drano will clean quite effectively things like a fork, as it designed to attack organic matter and that is the actual problem you maybe wishing to avoid. So your fork will most likely be the cleanest thing in your home.  However a wash in hot water and soap and then rinse under running water will be enough to ensure you haven't anything from the drano remaining.The final overkill step would be to put the fork in a container of water, if there is no visible reaction, it's clean.  Bonus if the container of water is dirty with oil from food. 
Safe to use a fork after touching drano?
Yes, the fork is entirely safe to use after washing. Drano is a combination of bleach and lye, both extremely water-soluble (and a thickener). It will rinse off of the fork easily; and after washing, will be entirely gone.
What's a good way to track my correspondence?
Either use carbon paper to generate a copy of every letter you write orCreate an electronic image of every page you write using either a scanner, photocopier, or ideally the camera on a smartphone.Either way you get the record of what you write, now you need to organize it. Assuming you get letters back using paper copies of your outbound letters lends itself well to a simple binder in chronological order. If you use electronic versions then file names and folder structure gets it done.
What's a good way to track my correspondence?
When reading your request I immediately thought about using a tickler archiving system. In the tickler system you have multiple folders: one inbox folder, one for each day of the month, some have one folder for each month, and one folder for each archive key (in your case the recipient of the letters). The key to making this work is that when you receive a letter you read it and decide when you want to answer it.  If you receive it on the 12th and decide to answer it in a weeks time you put it in the 19th folder.  If you want to answer in a few months time, put it in the corresponding month folder. When you answer it, take a look at the corresponding recipient folder, and put both received and, (copies of) sent letters in there when finished. The last step is to change your daily routine so that you'll check the tickler system each day to see if there are letters to be written. When switching months you also check if there are something for this month and distribute that to the days of the month. The inbox can be used for received unread letters, and should be cleared at start of routine. Added bonus: You can use the same system to keep track of bills to pay, invitations you need answer, maybe even keep the grocery list in there, or other stuff you need to keep track of with reference to days or months. 
How to write in a straight line without lined paper?
Obtain or make lined paper with extremely thick lines - if necessary you can make the black line as thick as a line of writing, and leave gap below it of the same height. If you put that underneath your plain paper the lines should show through.
How best to prolong the shelf life of eggs?
If you can purchase pasteurized-shell eggs, they will last the longest. I've kept pasteurized-shell eggs refrigerated for over three months with no loss in freshness.Recent research has shown that the European idea that washing harms the cuticle, promoting entry of bacteria through the shell is false, so it's perfectly safe to keep unrefrigerated eggs cool, but unrefrigerated.If you've purchased refrigerated eggs, keep them refrigerated. Condensation can form on chilled eggs coming up to room temperature that will promote bacterial growth.
My leather sandals started stinking. How can I make the smell go away?
Read the instructions for your washing machine, but normally you can, use wool wash or something similarly gentle. Dry them somewhere well aired.Now go out and buy another identical pair, and wear them on alternate days, so they can get nice and dry in between.
How to write in a straight line without lined paper?
The easiest way to do this is to get another piece of paperprint or draw lines set to the ruling you want (the height of thelines) in dark black ink on that pageplace that page underneath the line-less page on which you need to writeusing the lines visible through your line-less sheet, write your letter/document/whatever with nice, straight lines.You'll be able to see the lines faintly through the line-less page, and you will not need any extraneous objects on your page nor will you need to erase lines after you're done writing.If the paper on which you need to write is thick or printed-on like a birthday card, this probably won't work, but it'll do well for most normal paper.Here's a sample page:
Bought a Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper; How do I cut my hair without making a hairy mess on the floor?
You can do it over the sink in front of the mirror. If you don't keep the sink dry, it is relatively easy to scoop up all the hair from the sink afterwards using paper or disposable cloths. If you use toilet paper, you can throw it in the toilet after cleaning. When you've removed most of hair, you can flush the little hair that is left.Avoid flushing large amounts of hair into the bathtub or sink, as this will clog it. And do not throw trash bags (or anything of plastic) into the toilet!
Bought a Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper; How do I cut my hair without making a hairy mess on the floor?
Get a large sheet of plastic, or use an old tablecloth or any cloth that's large enough, stand in the middle and then use the clippers. Brush yourself off when you're done, then fold in the sheet and empty it. Easiest to empty with plastic, but this method means you can clip your hair anywhere you like in the home.
Bought a Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper; How do I cut my hair without making a hairy mess on the floor?
Use a large (queen or king) bedsheet spread out on the floor under your chair. This gives you a lot of space, and a sheet is generally heavy enough to not ripple if there's any air movement around it. After you're done, wrap your sheet up, take it outside, and shake it out. Birds need fibers to make their nests, so you can feel good about contributing to bird homes if you like.
Bought a Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper; How do I cut my hair without making a hairy mess on the floor?
Put newspaper paper in and around the sink. Put newspaper paper on the floor so it covers about a 3 foot radius from where you will be standing. When done, just slide the outer newspaper to the center while raising the outward edge slightly to help keep any hair from sliding off. Then fold it together just once or twice and shove it in the garbage.If you don't have any newspaper, other paper/cloth like materials should work fine as well.Do not get hair down the sink or bathtub drain! This will eventually clog it! So make sure to cover the drain with the newspaper. I've never been to a hair cut place where they used a vacuum to clean up the hair initially. They always just use the broom and dustpan approach. So don't use a vacuum initially, but probably would be OK to make sure you didn't miss anything after your primary method of removal.
How can I open the window when it's dark outside without fearing that moths might fly in?
I spray around the window frames periodically with bug spray.  Does a good enough job for me ( a few hours in the evening watching TV with windows open)...a more permanent solution may be required for others! 
Bought a Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper; How do I cut my hair without making a hairy mess on the floor?
The solution to your problem is dependent on the level of cleanliness you require and on your hair style. Fact is, if you are trying to clip your hair in a contemporary residential bathroom there is no solution that will prevent hair bits from winding up somewhere. The best you can do is maximally contain what you can with the expectation that you'll be doing some cleanup. With that said I recommend making sure everything is dry when you start. Dry dry dry. And don't get anything wet until you are 100% done. Use the towel, or sheet, or newspaper as you see fit. Then vacuum. Here is how I do it which keeps the hair out of the bathroom: first I clip my hair with my head in a laundry sink. That's in the sink. I bend over the sink and clip my hair. When I'm done with that stage I take my close-trimmer and a mirror to clean up the back. I currently do this in my dog's kennel area. I've done it in garages, basements, back porches, anywhere but inside. I've gotten really adept and trimming the back of my head.Once I'm done I go back to the laundry sink and scoop the hair bits out and throw them away. I clean it up by washing the few leftover bits down the drain. I've never had a drain problem. Then I sweep the floor in the kennel area. Then I take allot my clothes off and brush myself off very very well and then get in the shower. When I get in the shower I sit on the floor. I do this so that when the water hits my head the heat that bounces off stays contained at the bottom of the shower. If I stand up hair bits get scattered far afield.This is how I keep the hair out of my bathroom. I recommend that you stand in your bathtub. You will need a mirror that you can suction cup to the wall and a hand mirror. But seriously, if you have hair all over the floor of your tub it will be a task to get it down the drain. And it will be stuck in crevices in the shower curtain or other places. 
My leather sandals started stinking. How can I make the smell go away?
No you should not put them in the washing machine. Use saddle soap. Work it into a lather and apply to the leather, wiping it off as you go. Try not to use a lot of water as you do this. If you don't have saddle soap use something mild like Ivory or Dove. Warning - leather cleaners can change the appearance of leather. Also check with the manufacturer. Most manufacturers provide such conservative instructions that they are useless but you might get lucky. 
Can't cut my hair with clippers and I have no scissors. Any other solutions?
You could try burning your hair instead of cutting. It's a real thing; not trying to be funny. 
How can I get rid of my sneakers' stench?
Use baby powder! It will keep the shoes dry and prevent bacteria from growing as well as provide a nice deodorant. Several of my basketball mates used it.
Ways to avoid headaches while cooking
Try running the stove for a few minutes without a pan on the burner. If you still get a headache: you may be experiencing carbon monoxide poisoning. In this case, you need to massively increase the ventilation in your kitchen. 
Ways to avoid headaches while cooking
If the steam is causing problems get a fan and increase the ventilation.If the gas stove is causing the problem check for Carbon Monoxide.Either way, I would recommend getting some ventilation.

I use Evernote. If you use a smartphone, there is an app. The app lets you take a photo of the letters for storage, (Also the text in the photos is searchable).Alternatively there is OneNote, which also has an app.
How can I stretch a shirt?
You could try soaking the shirt in a salt brine. Just fill a container with water, add salt until the water is cloudy, put the shirt in the water and let it sit for 3 or 4 days.This "ages" the shirt. I've done it several times, and my shirts come out nice and soft.I'm not sure whether or not it will stop your shirt from shrinking, but it does affect the fabric in such a way that it becomes softer, so it might also stop it from shrinking.You could try testing on a white tshirt or something first.
How to find my way without a compass?
If you're in the northern hemisphere and it's snowed enough in the last few days to where snow is sticking to tree trunks, if the snow is predominantly on one side of the trees, that way points north. Since the last snowfall, direct sunlight has melted snow on the other sides of the trees. If you are in the southern hemisphere, the snow side points south.
Trick to measure the size of a mattress
You could compare it with the size of something that has a standard size. For example a CD/DVD is 120mm, so you could count how many times you can flip one over along an edge and get a rough measurement.
How can I stretch a shirt?
This is what I'd do:I expect the fibres will loosen when in wet and warm environment (but not hot, only warm, like not above 40 degrees Celsius) and then when the drying part comes - stretch it over something, like a canvas, all the way to it's limits, and then let dry naturally or dry with cold air. (not with the heating option of a fan...)my theory lies in the fact that stuff tends to re-shape and occupy more volume when in warm environment (picture ice melting...) and when in cold environment stuff tends to shrink or at least just stay put. I think it would work with fiber if you stretch it before it cools off from the washing machine.In fact, remember how clothes stretch a bit when you iron it (heat it up). Maybe it would work after ironing it and then stretching it and letting it cool up like that too.
Trick to measure the size of a mattress
If you really only need to distinguish between 140/160/180cm, just have your friend lay across the bed (with feet/head lined up to one side). Assuming you know (or he tells you) how tall he is, he can say something like "it's up to my shoulder/eyes/chest," and that's really all you need.
Where should a fan be aimed for maximum cooling of a room with one opening?
The fan should be well outside the door, facing towards the door. Imagine if you could see the air coming out of the fan, that it's bright green. It gets wider and spreads out as you get further from the fan. You want the fan far enough away that the entire door is taking up by the bright green air. Searching for how firefighters ventilate a room will give some good pictures  . 
How to clean inside of straw
I started with CRABOLO's solution - the finger on the hole and filling it with soap and water, but then I tore up a paper towel and tore it into little tiny pieces and wadded them up and shoved them into the straw, then I just blew them all out again.  Rinsed it again with water, then washed the outside.That worked to get the taste out of my straw after I put soda into my water cup.
Trick to measure the size of a mattress
Have him get a piece of string, cut it so it's the width of the mattress, and mail it to you.
Practical method to form/shape nalgene bottle
Currently, Nalgene bottles are made from a BPA Free, Copolyester called "Tritan".From literature on a similar medical grade version HEREIt looks as though you have to take it to AT LEAST 110C to get it to "glass transition" state, basically meaning it's almost workable.The difficulty here, is to achieve this temperature, you may need something other than boiling water, or similar.My suggestion (assuming you don't mind some trial and error, and losing some bottles in the meantime) is to heat the entire unit in an over set to just as close to 110C as you can.Then using some implements (wooden spoons, kitchen utensils, gloved hands, etc) manipulate it as you see fit. Also, I would cool it slowly to avoid introducing too much stress, too quickly to vessel which could cause cracks.Note(s): You want to keep the lid on the bottle I'm assuming, so take care not to deform the threaded area around the mouth of the bottle.Some plastics also have a "memory" to their molded shape, so even if you heat it and form it, the bottle may eventually resume its original shape (part of its benefit for some applications).IMO - the amount of effort and potential loss of a few water bottles may be more time, energy and cost than an extended research of products online. 
Bought a Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper; How do I cut my hair without making a hairy mess on the floor?
Amen to Holroy, first answer above.  I've been cutting my own hair for several years and do it over a dry sink and use a hand mirror and the medicine cabinet mirror to look at the back of my head. With each pass of the clipper, I gather the cut hair and let it fall into the sink.  Periodically I scoop hair from the sink and toss it into a waste basket.  When done, I use a hand broom & dust pan to get any which fell on the floor, and then run the water to flush any little loose hairs out of and around the sink. It usually goes smoothly with nothing left to clean up. 
Trick to measure the size of a mattress
Get your friend to measure it in sheets of a toilet roll and tell you how many. For the accuracy you need, even the brand won't be important, but you can be doubly sure by buying the same brand where you are then measuring that length yourself using a tape measure.
Replacement for watchband loop?
Velcro with an adhesive backing may do the trick. You just stick one "dot" on the tail of the watchband, and the other on the watch band so that it aligns with the first dot when you're wearing your watch.Be careful when putting on and taking off your watch not to snag the Velcro dot that is on the tail. It may come off over time.
Replacement for watchband loop?

how to avoid checking mobile during work?
It's probably not an addiction so much as a habit.  Put your phone in a drawer rather than on your desk, then keep a stress ball or spare pen or anything to keep your hands busy.  
How to safely lean against a window
TL;DR; "Generally" speaking, it's "probably" ok, but in terms of your safety my official response is "it's impossible to tell without a lot more info".  It being "safe" depends on:Window type - double or single glazed, or moreWindow structure - wooden, PVC, metalWindow age and condition - is it strong, new, or old and deterioratedHow the window is fitted - bars/supports from the window structurerunning into the walls, or just fasteners, and how strong they are(or are not)How much of you is pressing against the window or window frameWhich part of the window you lean on - the glass or frame orcombination, or if partly the window sillHow long you lean on it forDo you lean back hard, or gentlyProbably othersAlso relevant in terms of safety, is how far you have to fall if something did happen. It's never going to be good going through a window, but there is a difference in "risk" between falling 10 or 15 feet down from a house height versus a high rise and 50+ feet down. Neither is good, but there is a difference.  If the window is stable and not old and deteriorated, and fastened well, you are likely to be safe.However without physical evaluation it's hard to say, because of all the above mentioned points. Also, windows are not designed to be leaned on, certainly not over long periods as an ongoing support.Fashioning something to make it safer would likely entail putting something across the frame on one side and the frame on the other, and leaning on that. As then your weight is spread across the frame, rather than pressing on one single point, and certainly not on the glass itself.But this only reduces potential problems from not leaning directly on glass, and if the frame itself is weak then this will not be any safer.In conclusionIt's hard to say over the internet how strong a structure is without knowing anything about it, or how old it is (etc - as per above list).Deterioration is caused by various factors, which can vary or change depending on age, original build quality, and even things like your location - such as the weather (if you get lots of snow for example and you have wooden windows and don't maintain them regularly - etc).Personally, I'd recommend avoiding it if you can. Shuffle your room around so you are leaning on a wall, or fasten a board to the wall below the window which comes up to the height you are leaning (which may not be ideal is it will likely cover the window and you lose light and window access etc).
How to clean inside of straw
As this is Lifehacks and you are looking for "alternatives", I suggest that while pipecleaners and other similarly suggested tools are great ideas, the cost of said tools, soap, warm water, and your time would surely outweigh bar far just buying a pack of new straws.  Cost of soap and cleaners etc is not a massive amount at all, but your time is precious.  I see you are in San Francisco, and as an example, I notice there (seems to be) 3 Walmarts there.   50 straws for $0.99 at WalmartNEW STRAWS:I estimate you should be able to use the same straw for about a week (depending on what you drink, how much you drink, and if you rinse it out daily etc).  Per Year: $0.99, 30 mins(?) to go to the store.CLEANERS:(prices are very approx for demonstration purposes only)  Soap - $1 per yearWarm water (gas/electricity cost to heat water) $2 per yearPipe cleaners (or similar alternative) $2 per yearYour time - $priceless really, but say 15 mins a week (by the timeyou get the cleaners, soap, warm water etc)Per Year: $5 per year and 13 hours of your time - that's nearly 2 full days work!  
How to keep mosquitoes from biting through fabric?
You won't likely stop them biting through unless the fabric is quite thick, and then it might not be as breathable for your needs.  You need to make sure there is enough space between you and the mosquito net (including where it hits the hammock). Either tie it up better, or add more strings to pull it away from you. Or, depending on your setup, add an object (e.g. small sticks) inside between you and the inner net to push it away from you.  If the only problematic area is under the hammock, then you could attach a thick blanket to the underside of the hammock, or lay it on the hammock, if this is comfortable to you.  You can buy better quality nets, which might be an option.That said, you can get nets pre-treated with repellents, and are much more effective at repelling mosquitos than non pre-treated ones.Such nets can actually kill mosquitos upon contact of the net.  And you can apply repellent quite liberally, how much depends on the net you have really.  But sounds like the problem is the net position, not net quality.  
How to safely lean against a window
You asked whether it was possible to "fashion something that would put less stress on the window". You could get a board that is wider than the window, and at least 2/3 as tall as your back, and stand it up on one edge with both ends safely* leaning on the window frame.  Then you lean against that instead of leaning against the glass.Depending on how wide the window frame is, a wooden cutting board may do the trick.*I'm not sure how safe this really is, but it's probably a whole lot safer than leaning against a pane of glass!
How do I remove or clean the glitters from my skin?
All, of these solutions either involve time, money, or acid. All you have to do is put some olive oil on your skin, and wash it off. It is that easy.
How to protect your shoes from bad smell?
Use baby powder! It will keep the shoes dry and prevent bacteria from growing as well as provide a nice deodorant. Several of my basketball mates used it.
How to protect your shoes from bad smell?
Though you said you did this, every couple of days, put them in a large ziplock bag and place them in the freezer.  The problem with most solutions is that you wind up with the smell intermingling with the foot odor creating a worse smell.  Freezing will kill off the bacteria and smell for a few days until you need to do it again. Just make it a routine. It is even refreshing in he Summer to put them on freezing and they warm up quickly enough.  Works like a charm, especially on nasty smelling sandals.

How to remove gum from hair?
The best solution would be to rub oil(generally sunflower) in the hair where the chewing gum is.
My leather sandals started stinking. How can I make the smell go away?
Another solution would be to put a teabag in each shoe for a night.
How can I shave my back?
I would try taping your razor to a back scratcher, soap up your back and have at it.Not much research here, just a little common sense, if it is sturdy enough to scratch your back it should also be able to shave it with the proper attachment (a razor).
How can I shave my back?
My advice is that if you want the end result to be really good, you probably need a second pair of hands. Asking a friend to help you out (budget option) or visit a beauty salon (may be more expensive) would be my suggestions. Otherwise be careful with those razors.
How can I clean my backpack?
Depending on in what way the bags are dirty, you could use a sticky roll, you know the kind that you normally uses on clothes etc. This will probably lift of any dust, crumbles etc.
More efficient way to arrange a CD collection
There is no way you can keep them alphabetically sorted which doesn't require resorting (and/or reorganising) from time to time. Your best option in the physical realm is to leave room at end of shelves, like you described. But it does require a reorganisation from time to time. When reorganising do remember to start at the last shelf.To avoid reorganising the shelves, you'll have to forego alphabetic order. An option then could be to number each CD, and have an alphabetical list next to your shelves for easy lookup.My alternate solution has been to buy CDs, digitalising them, and then let my music player sort albums automatically. If you extend this with assigning a number to the CD when importing them, you could store them in sequential order, use the music player (of your choice) to sort the albums and play them, and get the cover for extra information by number if so needed.
More efficient way to arrange a CD collection
As holroy says in his answer, there is no "permanent" solution which will keep you from ever having to reorganize. Eventually, you'll fill all the shelves and need a new CD rack.Leaving space at the end of each shelf is about the best you can do. You can do that a little more intelligently by estimating how often you're getting CDs from artists whose names start with a particular letter. Look at your CD rack as it is now, and make a histogram of artists by first letter. Leave the most space on the most common letter, and the least space on the least common letter. Suppose you've got 100 empty spaces on the rack in total, and 10% of your albums start with A - leave 10 empty spots on the shelf with A. If only 1% of your albums start with X, just leave a single empty spot there. That way, you'll avoid reorganizing when you buy 10 A albums before you've bought your second X album. It's a little more complicated with multiple letters on the same shelf or multiple shelves for a single letter, but you get the idea.  Of course, you might run into trouble when you discover a pile of CDs by Queen or ZZ Top in the bargain bin...
How can I shave my back?
It isn't really shaving, but what about one of those hair removal creams? Going back to the back scratcher idea, you could maybe put a piece of plastic on the end (using tape or something) of the back scratcher and put some of the cream on there.
Is there a way to unstick 'tacky' buttons?
The mouse is most likely not made out of a one-piece mould. How would they then be able to insert the electronics afterwards? Or do you believe they put the plastic around it afterwards? In other words, it should be possible to disassemble the mouse.Searching for how to open a computer mouse revealed a few procedures, basically like the following:Disconnect the mouse, and flip it overAfter removing the slider pads, unscrew the screws hidden underneath slider padsSeparate the base and top shell of the mouse, hopefully revealing the button facesIf you don't see the button faces, you might need to unscrew some more and do more disassembling. Take care remembering what you did to disassemble it, so you are able to put it back together againThen you need to clean the sticky surfaces. Clean the button faces using a mild detergent, and rinse off with some water.  Be careful not get water inside the electronics if possible. Continue with cleaning the top shelf holding the actual buttons/fingers. Dry it of manually, and leave for some hours so as to make sure it is really dry.Reassemble the mouse, possibly using a little glue to get the slider pads to hold in place again. Hopefully there should now be no more tacky buttons.Disclaimer: Opening up the mouse, will most likely void any warranty, if any.
How can I shave my back?
Choose a proper toolTo me the key issue here is not actually doing the shaving, but seeing what needs to be shaved. I have used an electrical rotary razor with a trimmer section, and I've been content using the trimmer section. However as indicated in this answer, it could be well advised investing in a woman's electric wet/dry shaver, 3 Blade Foil Shaver. One of the blades is a trimmer that cuts longer hairs, the other two cut them short.  These could possible have a better handle on hair attached to a chest or the back.I haven't been able to use a manual razor on my back, and don't foresee how it can practically be done. Using an electrical razor gives you so much more leverage when it comes to reaching those hard to get places.Using mirrorsI tried different setups with mirrors, and the one working best for me was to stand with my back against a wall mounted mirror, and then have another mirror, either hand held or fixed in a tripod. In one case I had the luck of using a mirror inside the cupboard reflecting onto the wall mounted mirror.Either way I look into the small mirror to see the reflected image in the wall mounted mirror. The point being that it is easier to move/manouver the small mirror to see the correct section of your back, rather than first looking in the largest mirror and then finding the sector you are shaving.Alternative: Using camera phone?I haven't tried this my self, but you could possibly use a camera phone, web cam, or video camera which has a live feed, and then watch your back on a large screen whilst shaving.When shaving take your time and let the razor do it works, just concentrate on moving it somewhat regularly up, down, sideways, which ever way you need to in order to cover the back.Most people does actually have the dexterity to reach most part of the back when using both hands, and shift positions from over the shoulder to going around and up the back. And this is easier if holding an electrical razor which gives you that little extra in length to reach all over.It feels awkward moving/shaving in a mirror, and it does take a little bit of practice as you tend to move the wrong way a lot. But it gets the job done, without to much hassle. 
How can I clean my backpack?
Doing a search for cleaning backpack does give some suggestion indicating that either hand or machine washing is acceptable, if the care instructions (if present) allows it. One option could therefore be to remove frame before hand or machine washing it.However, what I usually do is to use a damp cloth to wipe the backpack clean. Simply using a cloth has proven succesful for my backpacks with a variety of (semi-)waterproof fabrics. In my experience this also doesn't affect the waterproofing to any great extent.
Hanging pictures on the wall without nails/tacks/normal tape?
If your concern is damage to the wall, you may want to consider a product such as the Command range of picture hanging products from 3M.These are designed for damage free hanging, they hold strongly and remove cleanly. I have used the hook versions of these, but the picture strips look like they will work for your application.
How to keep mosquitoes from biting through fabric?
To keep the mosquitoes away from your body, rub a handful of crushed basil leaves on your skin. Other methods you can try:candles with citronella essential oil - it`s a natural mosquito repellent;put a few drops of lavender to ribbon and place around open windows;eat more garlic - it acts like a barrier between the mosquitoes and your skin;
Replacement for watchband loop?
I've used thin no damage hair elastics like these:Preferably use thin ones because they don't create pressure on your wrist underneath the watch band.No damage ones because I personally find the hair elastics with metal a bit uncomfortable.Simply loop the elastics around the watch band and then it should hold the free end in place for you.
How to get rid of tap water taste?
Origin of the tasteThe taste of the water comes from dissolved minerals. If you want to change the taste, you need to change mineral count. There are few solutions for this:Buy a filterThere are numerous water filters out there, that make your water softer. This may also improve the taste. Another plus is that your kettle won't get limescale that fast.Boil the waterI often find that boiling the water improves the taste. This may be annoying, since you have to wait for the water both to heat up and cool off, but if you don't have other options, this is one of them.Use tap water to create drinks based on waterYou can make coffee, tea, or some sweet drinks using fruit syrups/juice. This will cover the taste of water, so it will no longer be the case.Side note: remember that all other options have some cost too. Boiling may need electricity/gas, filter needs to be changed regularly, and resources for creating drinks needs to be resupplied. If you do want to drink water and water only, you may want to calculate what's the best for your wallet.
What to do with the leftover part of a belt?
Cut it off.You don't need it.It is thus useless to you.Further more, it seems to be getting in your way.It may seem wasteful to cut if off. But you just don't need it.But what is your plan?To suddenly gain a lot of weight?If you are underweight, and intending on doing so, then wait until you have done so before trimming your belt.If you are a healthy weight, then I suggest reconsidering your plan to gain more weight.If you are concerned about reselling it or giving it away, then that would be overlyselfless, prioritising a possible future user over your current needs.How to cut it:Leather:Trace the curve on the end on to paper as a stencil, then trance back with a marker.Cut it with a sharp knife or a sturdy pair of scissors.Cotton:Cut it with sissors. Fold it and stich a hem on to stop it unraveling. Not too hard with a hand needle, but if you have a sewing machine, use it.Nilon:Cut and seal it like a rope.Heat up a old butter knife til it is red hot. Cut it, melting the ends shut. Dip fingers in water and mold it to a rounded edge. Or/And use a nail file to round it after it has cooled.Metal TipsIf it has  metal top on the end.Then you will need to examine how it is attached.The ones on cloth belts can normally be opened up prior to cutting and folded back over after you have cut.Metal ones can be reattached with rivets or superglue
How to read in bed without upsetting my wife?
Use E-book.While costly, this is by far the simplest solution. E-book media can generate enough light for you to read, but be dim enough for your wife to not be disturbed. This also allows you to control where light goes(you can turn screen back from her), as well as read book without generating too much noise(touch screen is silent, paper isn't).
How to read in bed without upsetting my wife?
I have stumbled upon this issue myself. I think a book light will suite your purposes. It's a small LED lamp that you clip onto your book and in most cases can be adjusted so that it points to the pages of the book without lighting up the whole room. 
How to clean tree sap off a windshield?
If you're looking for a lifehack v. a dedicated product, I would go down this road:Temperature will be key. If the sap is still in a rather large clump, ice works great. The sap will contract at a different rate than the glass, and usually dislodge in a rather large piece.If it has smeared (I suspect it has), you will need to get it warm. Maybe a piece of black paper underneath the affected area and leave it in the sun, possible steam, or other sources of heat that won't damage your glass (no blowtorches). Paper towels will help quite a bit if you can get it hot enough. For any remaining residue, dissolving it in copious amounts of alcohol(ethanol is best) is the only sure-fire way I'm aware of.
How to clean tree sap off a windshield?
Most solvents will remove sap and since this is a windshield you don't have to worry about paint! (Just be careful when applying). Try some of these that most people have around: hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, alcohol wipes, wd40, acetone or if you want to kill 2 birds use RainX (contains alcohol). They also sell specific products for this car part stores (Tar and goo remover).Be sure to remove any large chunks with a razor first and then clean up the residue.
How to read in bed without upsetting my wife?
If you plan to read for 30 minutes, get in bed 30 minutes before your wife. When she gets into bed with you, turn out your light, and both of you can fall asleep together at the same time.
How do I remove a bandage from thin skin?
Rubbing alcohol on a Q-tip is perfect. Start at the very edge of the bandage with a saturated Q-tip, and peel back the bandage as it loosens. I find this faster and cleaner than using petroleum jelly and/or baby oil.To avoid stings, go slowly and don't force the adhesive.
I need to prevent armpit stains in t-shirts. I want to apply something when I take the shirt off.
I recommend a spray bottle with vinegar (straight or diluted with water). It should help with deodorizing and act as a very mild anti-microbial. Or a paste of baking soda and water may be helpful. Both will not stain the clothing and can stay on for days. You can also put vinegar into your wash cycle to amp up the deodorizing effects.
How can I shower without a towel?
I know this situation very well. I thought of using a squeegee (the rubber thing used for wiping windows dry after washing). I'm pretty sure it works better than most other tools like hands, toilet paper or jumping around. It also is easy and economic to clean. Major drawback will be: You can't use it on your head if the seal is made from rubber or silicone as it will strip off your hairs due to high friction. For the head you will need a special Teflon squeegee.But I have to concede, I never tried it, but I'm going to, soon. 
How to get rid of tap water taste?
Run the water for a moment or two before filling your glass.There is stagnant water in your water pipes.  When you initially turn the tap on, this is the water that comes out.  If you wait a little bit, you will start getting water that is coming from the street.  It will presumably contain less non-water elements.This is the same reason why it takes some time for your shower to become hot.To test this, I would turn the hot water on at my sink and time how long it takes to become hot.  I would then turn on the cold water, and wait twice that duration ( just for kicks ).  If the water doesn't taste better, my idea didn't work.
How can I shower without a towel?
One or more dry hand towels and/or wash cloths will do the trick, especially if you brush water off your body first. You can also supplement with a blow dryer to speed the drying of the remaining droplets. (Not so fun on a hot day, but on a cold morning it's great!)
Take off a tag without scissors
Speaking of this kind of tags:Warming up the tag by any mean should work; however using water as well will be way more effective.For example, if possible, immerse the object to which the tag is attached to into hot water; otherwise, pour some hot water on the tag using a sponge or warm up the tag by any other mean.Either way, if using the hot water method, wait until the tag itself is impregnated and hot enough to come off with ease by gently lifting up the sides. Warming up the tag works because the heat will melt the glue under the tag, leading the glue to lose strenght enough for the tag to come off; using water as well for some reason, IME, greatly improves the effectiveness of this method.
How can I shower without a towel?
I usually don't use a towel after showering anyway.  I exfoliate to remove dead skin so I don't need the towel for that.  After showering, I brush off excess water while still in the shower, then apply oil (usually coconut or sesame oil, which I keep in the bathroom) to my skin.  I typically don't need lotion because of this.  My skin dries the rest of the way while applying face moisturizer and brushing teeth and I'm ready to get dressed.
How can I stretch a shirt?
Take it to a Laundromat - they have stretching services!
How can I shower without a towel?
At home, any garment will basically do the trick as long as you don't need to put it immediately afterwards. Being on vacation, that would also apply but as you're probably dealing with a limited amount of clothes, you might want to use it only until you buy a proper towel.
What to do with the leftover part of a belt?
If you wear a belt, your trousers probably have "buckles" (sorry i don't know how it would be called in English) to hold the belt so you can just tuck the leftover part into those.If you don't have that (then the belt will probably be less useful) or the buckles are to far away from each other so that the leftover part of the belt could be long enough to bother you, I would suggest using a rubber band that you put around your belt around the point where the leftover part ends. You then just have to tuck the ending part of the belt into this rubber band.
How can I keep sparkling beverages the fizziest as possible?
The problem is occurring because some of the CO2 is escaping into the air cavity at the top of the bottle which grows every time you pour more out. The gas pressure is greater in the liquid and it will equalise with the space in the bottle.You need to somehow reduce the space in the bottle. You can do this with a plastic bottle by squeezing it, but this is actually counter-productive as escaping gas will squeeze it back out again.So, you can transfer it to a smaller container or you could put something solid in the bottle (maybe baking beans - small food-grade ceramic things used for weighing down pastry before adding the filling). The problem with both of these approaches is that agitating the drink causes it to lose CO2 quicker.One final thing you could try is adding a pinch of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to the bottle before quickly closing it. This will react with the acid in the drink (won't work with mineral water) and generate CO2 in the sealed bottle and may or may not change the flavour perceptibly.
How can I keep sparkling beverages the fizziest as possible?
Liquid retains c02 better when colder, so keeping it in the fridge will prolong its fizzyness. If these other suggestions don't pan out, there are soda making machines that you could repurpose by just using them to add c02 back into your drinks. They basically pressurize the container with c02 to force it into the liquid. You might could rig something together with a c02 tank and some valves if you wanted a more hack like experience. Places that sell these will have tanks, as well as paintball stores - which can also refill these tanks. 
How can I keep sparkling beverages the fizziest as possible?
How about a soda saver pump thingy*? Scientists will certainly argue that this can't work because of, well, science (like Dalton's law), but the Amazon reviews tell a different story. In chemistry and physics, Dalton's law (also called Dalton's law of  partial pressures) states that in a mixture of non-reacting gases, the  total pressure exerted is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of  the individual gases.*The soda saver pump thingy is a small pump that replaces your soda cap. There are also DIY examples made out of bike pumps. 
How can I keep sparkling beverages the fizziest as possible?
Even though the approaches in the answer by Dave sounds promising, I do believe you need to tackle the problem another way. You state in a comment that you drink a glass a day,  and that a bottle last about a week, but that there is little or no fizz left at the end. That is natural, and kind of hard to avoid when you don't finish it quickly. I've got two suggestions for you which both are in the category keep the agitation of the soda to the minimum, and finish it off faster (that is limit the times you agitate the soda). My primary suggestion is to start buying soda boxes,  or in general in smaller containers. This way you'll empty it, before it goes still. My secondary suggestion if you keep buying the larger variants is to cool it before opening it for the first time, and then when you open it divide it into multiple bottles with good lids.You'll loose some fizz in this initial transfer, but it should be considerably less than when opening and closing the larger bottle once each day. Especially when you at end of the week open a smaller bottle which has only been opened once before (when it was filled up). 
Take off a tag without scissors
Nail clippers should do the trick (a little bit at a time). They're easy to operate with just one hand.
How to get rid of mosquitoes without electricity?
We use very small mosquito tents that just cover our heads. I am including a picture here to demonstrate the form. In the photo the item appears to be one of those pop-up type items; the ones I have use two flexible and collapsible fiberglass rods.Yes, this photo shows a sleeping bag but these are usable with standard bedding.
How to get rid of mosquitoes without electricity?
One simple solution is to sleep in a tent. Just get a tent big enough to fit your mattress inside if you don't want to use a sleeping bag.This is very similar in essence to using a mosquito net, but more people already have tents lying around than have unused mosquito nets.
How do I remove a bandage from thin skin?
Instead of using a bandage with adhesive, you can use gauze pads and an elastic bandage (commonly called Ace bandages).Usually this is used for large wounds too large to cover with small adhesive bandages, but you can also use it as a general-purpose alternative to adhesive bandages. If the bandage is too long, you can cut it to be shorter.This is what I have in mind:
How to get rid of tap water taste?
Drink ice water instead of water at room temperature. It's harder to notice the taste of the minerals when the water is cold, and cold water has a higher concentration of dissolved oxygen--what makes water taste good--which should mask any mineral taste left over.
How to read in bed without upsetting my wife?
Use a headlamp.Many headlamps come with dim light and red light settings, which you can use to make the light less bothersome for your wife.[Note: I am not recommending this specific product, just using this one as an example.]

Earplugs hacks for keeping water out of my ears?
Swimmers wax. My young nephew is prone to ear infections and had tubes in his ear. Both to go to the pool and to take a bath, he uses this product. It's not a hack, but it is typically under $2 from a drugstore, so I'd call it close enough. Basically any paraffin/wax that is mold-able, but not soft enough to "drip" or ooze into your ear canal.
How do I remove or clean the glitters from my skin?
I found that rubbing baby powder on your skin helps glitter wipe off. The bits of sweat/oils make the glitter stick. The same trick works for sand from the beach.
Take off a tag without scissors
The tags in that picture are really big! If your goal is to keep them from flapping around or scratching your forearm, I have a workaround that doesn't involve cutting: Fold the tags against the outside of the cast/brace, and tape them there.
How to quickly thaw accidentally frozen milk?
One of the faster methods to unfreeze anything is to put it in a larger container containing water. The water don't need to be heated, as it is still warmer than the frozen stuff. This works do to the amazing capabilities of water related to heat absorption and heat transfer, and the more water the better. Moderately heated water will speed up the process, but if you use water close to boiling temperatures you might end up cooking part of the stuff you want unfreezed.Do however remember to place the object you want to unfreeze in something which both is waterproof and doesn't hinder the transfer of heat from the frozen object into the water. A plastic bag will be sufficient in most cases. For a container used for milk, this should be no issue, so just stick it into the water, and watch it unfreeze.An added benefit of using water as a thawing agent it is that the final temperature will be around the temperature of the water. With regards to food or milk this is usually a good temperature, as it doesn't ruin it and it is ready for other use.
Humanely persuade neighbourhood cat not to defecate in my garden
It depends on the places, where the cat leaves its droppings. Usually cats prefer places with soft and loose soil like freshly raked flowerbeds or sand. If that's the case you can place chicken wire over the ground. At least my cats dislike that. An alternative is a layer of rough bark mulch. This also prevents cats from digging holes and burrowing their droppings.In case your neighbours' cats don't dig but place their droppings on flat ground and possibly everywhere e.g. on the green, you have to resort to other means. There are certain substances that deter cats with their odour, available at hardware stores. Some of them are based on plant parts which are disliked by cats others are synthetic deterrents.Deterrents are spread on the floor where cats leave their droppings. A major drawback is, that most deterrents are washed away by rain and have to be reapplied regularily.I consider deterrent devices based on ultrasonic sound as inhumane to some degree, so I don't recommend them.For difficult cases there are automatic robots with an infrared eye and a electrically controlled water hose. While expensive they seem to be effective.  
How to stop water from dripping on the sink counter and bathroom floor when washing hands?
I have an arrangement which looks similar to yours. Unfortunately, our counter is made of a type of granite which stains if we don't dry it immediately. I solve the problem by keeping smaller towels, sometimes called "hand towels," right up against the edge of the sink on both sides, leaving no exposed counter.  Soap stains our counter too, so I place the dispenser on a small square towel, which we call a "wash cloth," and it covers the area between the dispenser and the sink. There are a few benefits to my system:Having a towel at my fingertips eliminates the need to turn away from the sink to reach for a towel, which alleviates the problem of dripping water on the floor. The smaller towels can be used multiple times, after which they go into the washer, where they take up less space than a large towel that only has a small wet section caused by drying our hands. (If I don't like the look or feel of the wet hand towel, I fold it in on itself, so it's still flat and pretty, making sure of course that no wet parts end up resting on the counter!)Small towels often come in a set with larger towels, so you may already have them around the house. If not, they are inexpensive at a number of stores. Kitchen sink towels work too, and many people already have those.
What is the quickest way to de-carbonate a drink
Put a frying pan on the stove, pour the soda in, and crank the heat.  The frying pan will preferably have ridges in it ( it wont be an exactly flat surface ).  By the time the soda is boiling, it will be pretty darn flat ( a minute or so? ).  You don't really need to boil it, bringing it to 60 degrees Celsius will probably suffice.A carbonated drink is one that has had carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) dissolved into it.  This is generally done by forcing CO2 into it via pressure, and this is the reason why air ( CO2, in fact ), is pushed out of the bottle when you open it.The word "dissolved" is key, as it speaks about the solubility of the CO2 in the liquid.  Temperature greatly effects this solubility, as the temperature increases, CO2 solubility decreases.  If you think about why boiling water creates bubbles, this makes sense.  Oxygen is not as soluble in hot water as well.Water near its freezing point can contain the most CO2.  As the temperature increases, this amount drops significantly.  However, it is not a linear drop, and by about 50-60 degrees Celsius, the curve is leveling off.  As KalleMP states, you don't really have to bring it to a boil.  However, what kind of life hack is it if you're holding a thermometer in your hand? :)There is also the fact that a freshly opened bottle of soda contains more CO2 than the atmosphere, so the CO2 will escape even from ice cold soda.  Increasing the exposed surface area of the soda will increase the rate of this escape.The bubbles that form inside your glass are doing so at places that actually contain microscopic air bubbles ( think porous ).  The CO2 will rapidly collect in these points, and larger bubbles will form.  These are the bubbles that you see coming off the side of your glass.So, high temperature, surface area, pores... I'm going to go with boiling it on a frying pan.
How to get cat urine smell out of wooden floors?
I had dark cat urine stains on the hard wood floor, on a daily basis I sprayed the area with Hydrogen Peroxide 3%  solution and within three weeks the stains were almost completely gone. This information I found in a You tube video.
What is the quickest way to de-carbonate a drink
Adding a teaspoon full of sugar will get rid of carbonation quickly; you will of course have a slightly more sugary drink.
How to pick up fallen apples quickly?
You could put up a sign inviting the neighborhood kids to pick apples from your yard for free.
How can I open or loosen a metal screw cap of a bottle of polyester resin?
Punch a hole in it and either use the last of the product or pour the remainder into a new container. Or use the longest channel locks you can find and rip that sucker off. 
How can I open or loosen a metal screw cap of a bottle of polyester resin?
If the resin has completely set, you may need to break the cap or bottle to get out the remainder. However, it may just be extremely viscous, so you could try slow, steady force with a rubber band wound around the cap to get a better grip (squeezing with pliers will just break the container).Gently heating the top in hot water may also reduce the viscosity, allowing the rubber-band trick to turn it.There are also rubber strap-wrenches, but they might also crack the bottle, though less likely to do so than pliers.
What is the quickest way to de-carbonate a drink
Whilst searching for some alternatives to support an idea of mine regarding decarbonating, I found a somewhat amusing thread: How can I de-carbonate soft drinks? (from the boards of "The Straight Dope").Based on ideas mentioned there and another one of my own:Pour the drink into a larger container to increase surface area, i.e. a cake tin. Leave for a little while, before repoured into a drinkable containerPut the drink into a blender, and give it a spin. A less amusing option, is to stir with a spoon for a few minutesSift the drink into another container. That is either use an ordinary sifter/sieve/strainer, or use something like a coffee filterEither of these options should agitate the drink and decarbonate it. In terms of practicality, I would opt for the latter one. Especially if at office or at home. At office you need to a get a little sifter, but they are readily available.
How to protect micro switches?
Most likely you could clean the contact area using canned air, and blow it clean. After cleaning it I would consider closing it of for protection.One option springing to mind for protection is to use Sugru – Sugru is mouldable glue. Stick it, shape it and it will turn into rubber. I'm not affiliated with them, and have not actually tried it, but read a little about it, and it should fit your need here. It will not, as I understand, be so runny that it ruins your contact, but after it has turned into rubber it is still flexible enough to use the contact.Another option could be to use blank tape, but I recon that will not stick for very long. And if using hot glue to cover the button would would loose flexibility and risk damaging the contact. Edit: See How can I fix my car key when the rubber buttons fall off for a related question.
How to safely wash my computer with garden hose?
Generally, blowing dust out of a computer is enough to keep it satisfactorily clean. If you spill something that needs liquid to remove, use isopropyl alcohol. Apply with a cotton swab gently until clean. The do it again to get trace residue off. Leave it for two minutes, more than enough time for a small amount to evaporate, before turning the system on. 
How to pick up fallen apples quickly?
I cannot find a common name for this device, but the tool below is specifically designed to roll over fallen apples to pick them up. Search for "apple roller", "apple pickup roller", "apple rolling harvester", "apple mower", "apple weasel", "apple wizard", etc. Use Google's image search for a really easy way to spot a product without having to crawl through a lot of false positives.bonus tip ⤴If you have trouble finding an apple-specific solution, a tennis ball roller does essentially the same thing.
How can I shower without a towel?
My solution would be, to get in the clothes which you wear anyway. If you brushed some water of with your hands, the clothes won't be getting soaked. They will be dry after about ten minutes, and no one will know what kind of "trouble" you had...
How to remove a hard boiled egg's shell quickly, by hand, without damaging the egg?
When I need to peel freshly boiled egg, but still want the egg to be warm, I do the following:Run cold water over the egg(s) to cool the exterior of the egg, and to make it slip insideUsing a knife (or the edge of the table) crack it on the sidePeel the egg, taking care to include the inner 'skin' when peeling, which helps getting every piece of shell of the eggIn short, giving the egg a shock of cold water, makes the peeling much easier, whilst the egg still is warm inside.
What is the quickest way to de-carbonate a drink
Being a big tea-drinker, I have 1,5l glass containers with wide openings.Simply pour your drink into a large container from a decent height. A bottle of half a liter will bubble up to the top, but once settled down again will be devoid of carbon dioxide. Depending on the drink, container there might still be a tiny bit of fizz.
How to get rid of tap water taste?
I grew up in Russia where the tap water was not safe to drink.  We would frequently buy water bottles because some of my family were very particular with the water's taste.However, other great solutions to the undrinkable tap water existed:1) Get a Brita water filter (https://www.brita.com/).  I use this in my college dorm in America.  Even though Chicago's tap water is drinkable, I can taste the difference having grown up in a very water-sensitive area. Brita filters are cheap and definitely clean the water (In one of my classes, we viewed before & after images of carbon dust used in Brita filters and it definitely physically changed while filtering tap water)2) Invest and buy a filtration system (http://www.aquasana.com/) for your tap.  My family had this for a while before we moved apartments in Russia.  The water tastes a lot cleaner and depending on the filter you get, will vary in taste as well.3) If filters aren't for you, and you just want to mask the mineral taste of tap water, drinking ice-water, making other drinks (tea/coffee) or boiling will certainly help.
What is the quickest way to de-carbonate a drink
Use a vacuum wine saver. This is a product that has a bottle cap with a valve and a pump. It is intended for pumping the air out of the top of a wine bottle to keep the contents fresher but if you've ever actually made wine you'll probably know that you have to degasify it before bottling and you can use one of these. Put the cap on bottle with the drink in and keep pumping until you see no more bubbles coming out of the liquid
How to remove a hard boiled egg's shell quickly, by hand, without damaging the egg?
You have to boil it correctly first - otherwise the egg will stick to the shell.Lower the egg(s) directly into boiling water instead of putting the eggs in while the water is still warming up.This loosens the shell and lets you peel by hand afterwards - no problem.
How can I shave my back?
Get a bakblade. It looks like a windshield squeegee with a safety blade. It works and I'm amazed it isn't in stores. Amazon has them.
Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
The solution lies in almost crashing into the wall without damaging the car. This can be achieved by mounting a light movable stick to the wall, or very close to the wall. Attach something visible to the top, so that you easily identity when you hit the pole, but before you crash into the wall. The pole or stick could be mounted at 2 or 3 inches from the wall, leaving 6 or 5 inches for the garage door! Edit: One option for a light movable stick,  could be a stop sign on pole garage or similar stuff 
What is the quickest way to de-carbonate a drink
Take a paper napkin (also works with kitchen paper towel) and twist it into a tube shape;Pour the drink into a cup and simply stir with the napkin.The gas bubbles will fill the free spaces between the napkin's particles, de-carbonating your drink.
Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
A common solution I have seen is to have a tennis ball (or similarly soft item) that can be hung from the ceiling. (You may be able to purchase a kit made for this purpose.) With the assistance of another person, drive your vehicle into the garage to a place where you have clearance on both sides. Fasten a string to both the ceiling and your tennis ball.  The ball should hang down and just touch your windshield (windscreen).  Upon returning, drive into the garage just enough to touch the tennis ball to the windshield. You should be positioned with enough clearance to not damage the wall or the garage door.Image found on http://v6mustangperformance.com/
Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
You can purchase/make a parking stopper for your car.If you are going to make one, get an old piece of carpet and short piece of wood at least 1 inch in diameter. The carpet needs to be long enough that when folded, it will fit under the tire. Loop the carpet around the stick with the excess carpet toward the garage door. The weight of the vehicle will hold the stopper in place. Once you get to the stick, you will feel resistance to moving the car further forward.Updated:As pointed out by Holroy, this method is subject to sliding around.  Some glue would help to prevent the sliding.  Your flooring will dictate the type of glue necessary.Image found on http://www.auto-care.com/
Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
Another option, if you find it hard to build a movable stick, fasten the parking stopper, or don't trust the tennis ball, is to make a bumper or fender on the wall. I.e. one made out of foam padding or porolon.As my father worked with upholstery, we had rolls of porolon, which sometimes where stored in the garage. Parking was never easier than when those were stored in the garage. We just drove until we saw the porolon/foam padding roll move a little...A simpler variant, is to glue a piece of foam padding, i.e. 4 inches thick, to the wall, and then insert a little stick with a flag on top of it. Glue it on the wall in a height where the front bumper will touch it, and when it does, you'll see the flag wave at you. PS! You could use an old mattress (or part of it) for this trick. Just fasten it to the wall, and hit it gently. Then you are home safe with the parking.
How to repair a physically damaged whiteboard?
The easiest solution might be to dismount the board and carefully fill the dent from behind the writing surface with material similar to the rest of the "underlayment".Another option would be to obtain a piece of the same type of whiteboard, whether purchased or salvaged from another board, cut out a rectangle around the damaged area, and create a precisely measured patch from the additional piece. There might still be a slight border around the patch requiring a bit of fine sanding and covering with varnish (or clear nail polish).Spackling would almost certainly fall out and would create an uneven writing surface until it broke loose.It might be easier and only a bit more expensive to replace the whiteboard; a 36" x 24" board at Amazon lists for ~US$32.
How to repair a physically damaged whiteboard?
Sand the area around the dent, until the white part is gone, usually down to the metal, then use bondo or other automotive body filler and fill in the dent. Feather the bondo out and sand it smooth. Then paint your whiteboard paint over that. YouTube should have plenty of videos showing a proper use of bondo or body filler. Lots of work but will be a professional looking fix. 
Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
Some trucks and buses have a mirror to eliminate the front blind spot.truck front mirror http://oi39.tinypic.com/10n81dz.jpgReverse the principle - attach any old mirror to the wall/ceiling.  Might need a bit of trial and error (and a tall friend) to get the best position.
Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
Park your car driving into the garage backwards. Use both your side mirrors to align the car with the garage. Use the co-driver's side mirror for side to side navigation. Make a mark on the wall that aligns to the mirror when parked in deep enough.With a bit of training you can keep your eyes on the co-driver's side mirror the whole time while parking. You can also get quite close to the wall on co-driver's side, which leaves lots of space to climb out of your car.I'm using this method for a garage that goes deep in but isn't comfortably wide. Marking the wall is an addition to my method with regard to the depth of the garage. Since I'm only looking at the one mirror that's supposed to align with the marking in the last phase of parking this should work fine.
Humanely persuade neighbourhood cat not to defecate in my garden
I never tried this. Found this question on quora, https://www.quora.com/Does-blue-colored-water-keep-dogs-away. Some people say blue colored water help to keep away the dogs. As per the answer, it does not guarantee it. But it is worth a try with those neighbor cats. Take a bottle and fill some colored water and keep it in you garden.Another idea, just keep some air filled balloons in the garden. When cats try to play, balloon explosion happens and cats will run away. Try this for a few days and eventually they will change the place.Please let us know the result of these experiments.
How to keep earphones properly in ears while riding
Other than buying sports earphones, the simplest solution is to hook the earphones over your ear. Although not entirely foolproof, this prevents the earphone being slowly pulled out of your ear, or at least reduces how often it happens. Your ear absorbs some of the tugging, and the positioning within the ear canal is generally more resistant to the earbud being pulled out.
How to read in bed without upsetting my wife?
If you utilize a reduced output lamp and that still isn't suitable to your wife then apply a yellow filter on your lamp.  Ideally you want to eliminate any and all stray white light.Alternatively rather than constructing a filter purchase a yellow output LED. Just ensure that the output is in and only in the yellow range.  This should significantly lower any irritance your wife maybe experiencing while you read.  Additionally it shouldn't cause her to wake up fully in the event she does for whatever reason open her eyes for a fraction of a second, even longer.Our brains do not perceive such light as an indication of daytime or the need to change our waking state.
Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
This, put into the floor or block of wood. Drive up to it, just till you tap it. Then stop. Resist the urge to back up. Edit - I changed from a driveway marker image to my 'in the wild' image from my garage. I made 2 of these, and have used both for 10+ years. It's positioned to both protect the steps from getting smashed and to allow enough clearance to walk in front of the car. 
How can I keep sparkling beverages the fizziest as possible?
If you like to live dangerously you can add a carefully sized small piece of dry ice to the bottle after you have taken out your daily dose (slightly larger each day as the empty space is enlarged).  This does require a regular source of dry ice and is not safe, if you add too much you create a bomb and people (mostly kids) have been maimed with similar experiments when handling a bottle that is pressurised higher than it can handle.I think the other answer of making the drink VERY cold and decanting into smaller (VERY cold) pressure SAFE bottles is the way to go. My version is for Darwin award candidates.
How can I shower without a towel?
How about rolling around on the bed for a few moments and then getting dressed.  The bed clothes will dry (or perhaps get changed in a hotel) on your return.
How to safely lean against a window
The first level of added safety would be to fit protective cling film onto the glass (both sides even), such as used for anti-hijack purposes on cars.  Any type of glass film will help but some are purpose made to reduce danger if the glass breaks.  Adding a sheet of Lexan/polycarbonate/Perspex in front might be a more durable option and an easier sell to other parties, depending on the size you may need a moderately thick sheet, not the cheapest option.  Replacing glass with suitable laminated or toughened safety glass is also a option for even more money.
Practical method to form/shape nalgene bottle
If you are keen to do the experiment it should be possible.  The volume measurement markings will no longer be exactly calibrated but the error should be smaller than casual measuring would require.You need to prepare 3 thingsAn adjustable temperature hot air gun (or a blow torch if looks don't matter)A curved insulating mask (thick card stock or many thin cards) with a hole the size of one indentation (or all of them if you are a gambler)A hose and connection to a source of vacuum such as your mouth suction that can be fitted to bottle neckHook up suction, align mask, heat with 120degC hot air and use judgement.  Hold vacuum until plastic cools again.EDIT:The best source for a mask would be a cardboard shipping tube or roll material core that the bottle would fit in with not too much space.  Open the hole with a few drill holes and shape it with a fine rasp.  The aim is to limit the amount of hot air that gets past the mask. The required 120 degC is not very hot and most any non-plastic fibrous material will work.  Sticking a layer of tin/aluminium foil to the outside (or using some form of metallized heat shielding) might be the best if you want to go into production. The reflective shielding would probably allow you to use radiant heating (slower but more controllable) and it would basically be localised vacuum forming.

Your idea isn't half bad actually. Id say take if not spackle then cocking glue and put over a small piece of 3M whiteboard vinyl. Should work like a charm.
What to do with the leftover part of a belt?
If you buy a belt that's a couple inches too long, it gives you a little room to expand if needed, without being overly long.  But let's say you do that and lose some weight and now you've got several extra inches.My pants have about 6 inches (15 cm) between the front loops. My belt buckle is about 2 inches (5 cm) across, meaning I have about 4 inches (10 cm) of play. I buy the belt so the tip is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) sticks out the loop on my left (I put my belt in right to left, so it wraps around me and sticks out to the left), and I center the buckle right over my button/zipper area.Now, let's say I get fat and add 2 inches (5 cm) to my waste size. I can shift my buckle to the left by the same 2 inches and the loop still holds the excess.On the other hand, let's say I lose weight and remove 2 inches. Now I shift the buckle to the right and the original 1 inch is sticking out the left loop.This doesn't work as well with dress pants if you want to keep the buckle lined up with your zipper line, but it's nice for more casual wear. Even if you don't want it to be extremely offset, a little movement can help a lot.
Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
I like marking the wall with something (e.g. permanent marker) to line up with the mirrors.Just park the car carefully, then mark on the wall where your wing mirror is, then in future just drive forward until your mirror lines up with the mark.Simple and cost-effective... No need to purchase anything or hang things from the ceiling.
Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
I have such a garage and the visible marker technique mentioned by many here works for me. There is a electrical socket on the side of the garage. I make sure the electrical socket lines up with the end of the front passenger door of my minivan. This gives me about 3 inches every time. Just make sure you don't lean too much forward in your seat when you check alignment with the marker. Some kind of marker in a more easier and surer place for you will work great. (Still, there is some thrill factor involved every time!)
How to remove a hard boiled egg's shell quickly, by hand, without damaging the egg?
Salt! Toss about a tablespoon of salt in the water used for boiling the eggs. The shells will peel really easy while leaving the insides pristine. A few taps around the egg and the shell usually just comes off in a single piece like removing a garment leaving the interior unscathed. Works for me with about 95% eggs. (Very rarely I have seen an egg's interior that still sticks to the shell even with this. Must be those tuff ones we hear about!)
How can I get a head-phone plug out of the jack?
If you can add a close-up photo of it, that would be excellent.  Until then, I'll assume there is at least a millimeter sticking out. If so, try grabbing that with needle-nose pliers.If that fails, you could CAREFULLY put a dot of Super Glue on the tip of a straightened paperclip. Press that against the headphone plug ONLY. Hold it very, very still for 10-20 seconds.  If it dried correctly (fingers crossed!) you may be able to slowly draw out the end of the plug by pulling on the paperclip. (DON'T get it stuck to anything except the plug you're trying to remove!)
How can I get a head-phone plug out of the jack?
There's a very good chance that the socket is not completely enclosed (it will most likely be in the form of a springy piece of metal with a kink in it to lock the plug in place), so if you removed your case from your computer you'd be able to push it back the other way. It should go without saying that you should disconnect all electrical power before opening the case up and avoid touching any circuit board components.
How to tell a person their fly is down
You can be discreet about it.Generally, the most effective, and discreet, way to tell him would be to place one hand on his shoulder, and whisper it in his ear so that the others can't hear. This gives him the opportunity to make the judgement call as to whether or not he should fix it. You should lean in from one side, and potentially block the view of him from the others with your body. Make it look like you are just delivering a friendly message.You don't have to be blunt, you can keep it discreet while conveying the full message (in a safe manner):Hey man, couldn't help but notice your fly is down. You might want to fix that.You should definitely tell him. Personally, if I were in his shoes, I would want you to tell me somehow. (Discreet or not, I don't need any bits flopping places they shouldn't be.)
How to tell a person their fly is down
One way would be to tell the barista that your name is JellaShuhr FlaiDown (assuming he's wearing a yellow shirt). Then you just walk straight out of the coffee shop and go on with your day, knowing in 5 minutes or so they will announce that to the whole store. By then, you will be long gone. You sacrifice $5, but it's for a good cause. If you can overhear his first name from his coffee order, even better.

Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
There's multiple things you can do to prevent hitting the wall.Install a closet mirror on one side of the wall. That way you can see how close you are to the front wall.Install a guided laser beam and pick a spot on the windshield. Some kits have two lasers, for two car garages. I find these to be a lot of work to setup (mounting, power, alignment, etc).Install a tire plate and chuck that prevents your front tire from going past a certain point. Yes, they may slide. Some have 4 holes to anchor them into the floor. Might be overkill.My car had a reverse-camera, so I would always back in. You can look into aftermarket kits if your vehicle doesn't have one.Tape method. Place a piece of tape on the floor that lines up with some letter or sticker on your door sill. At most you open your door half way as you pull in, staring down until the tape lines up with some mark on the door sill. 
How do you deal with runny nose?
Stick wads of tissue up your nostrils.A con of this is it is harder to breath. If only one nostril is acting up, just put it in that one. A con of this is the tissue is itchy, and it causes the other nostril to run more.This is far from an optimal solution.

How do you deal with runny nose?
There isn't a hack answer to this problem - if you've got a runny nose because you're getting a cold, it should pass within a day or so. If you frequently have a runny nose that goes on for some time, or keeps recurring, you've probably got allergic rhinitis which might be a hay fever response at certain times of year, or some other allergic response to something you're frequently exposed to or are eating (dairy, for instance). Consult your doctor, you may need to take antihistamines or use a nasal spray to control it.
How to fix loose wire in headphone?
Depending on what part of the wire you talking about it could bethe wire is losing it's connection to the speakerthe wire is broken inside the wire wrappingin these cases it is possible to fix.

How can I fortify micro USB connectors
Something like this might solve your problem:stretchy cable http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/32262062751_1/Free-shipping-Flexible-and-stretch-USB-2-0-Charger-Cable-For-iPhone-5-5g-5S-5C.jpgI've had many a USB connector break over the years, but cables like this really help because they gradually increase in tension as they stretch out.If your connectors are breaking because you typically use the phone at the maximum length of the cable, this will naturally discourage that habit, due to the cable trying to pull the phone back - you'll choose to sit a little closer to the charger to eliminate the extra effort required to hold it under tension.If it's because the phone gets knocked off a table or because of someone tripping over the cord, the stretchiness will slow the phone's fall in the former case, or reduce its acceleration in the latter.Basically, it gives you a foot or two of difference between the "cable his under tension" point and the "connector is under stress" point (as opposed to a few mm difference with a straight cable).Also: always unplug the phone by gripping the connector itself, not by pulling on the cable.don't unplug by pulling the cord http://www.senecalightandwater.com/Portals/0/PullPlugCord.jpg
How can I remove grease from controllers?

How to tell a person their fly is down
You could write a note saying that his fly is down on a small piece of paper and then hand it to him. Just say that he dropped it or you think he dropped it and make sure to put it directly in front of him so he reads it. You can put:" YOUR FLY IS DOWN. I noticed but did not want to embarrass you."You may want to say your pants are unzipped if fly is not a term used in that area. If he is polite he make take it and say thank you. This has worked me. Something from my youth we used to say is "X,Y,Z". This means examine your zipper. Not all people may get that though. 
Preventing paper towel waste by tightening the roll
This has a built-in tension spring to get around just this problem.  As you can see from the image below, the disk on the side of the roll adds tension and keeps the roll from spinning endlessly.http://www.amazon.com/Simplehuman-Mount-Paper-Holder-Stainless/dp/B002YI653C
How to fix loose wire in headphone?
Something that is very low tech, but that works for me is if you take a rubber band or a piece of tape and use that to hold the cord at a angle. This is by no means permanent, but does extend the life of the headphones. 
Unlock a suitcase with a possible broken lock
First of all: To open it you can jam a pen in through the zipper, and get the suitcase open. It is possible to close up again, but be gentle when finishing it off.  And of course it is better to actually get the lock opened instead of this hack. To unlock it, if the code has changed, you either need to try all the different combinations. Or if you are lucky, you have a reset switch/button on the inside of the suitcase. Look for a small button or tiny hole of some sort. If the lock is jammed or broken, you might have a bigger problem as you most likely need to apply enough force to unjam,  but not so much force that it breaks... 
How to peel shell of boiled eggs without damaging the egg?
In general, if eggs are too fresh the shell won't separate from the eggwhite without ripping of parts from the egg. So if you have the right eggs (approx 5 days old from laying) I recommend to break the shell of the egg by hitting it gently onto a hard but even surface like a table. You should to break the shell all around in pieces not bigger than 1 cm in diameter. Then start from the bottom of the egg with peeling it piece by piece.This should yield the best result. 
Humane destruction of slugs
Not sure this is the right place for this question, probably would have been best in the Garden and Landscape section, but there is a slightly hacky answer:- personally, I prefer the beer trap solution - you fill a small container with some beer, sink it into the soil (you'll need more than one for a large area), the slugs go in and eventually die. But at least, hopefully, they won't know much about it because they're drunk...http://www.slugoff.co.uk/killing-slugs/beer-trapSalt does actually kill a slug quite quickly, but I cannot imagine its a comfortable process, being dehydrated so quickly. Salt, though, should not be applied to the soil, so the slugs need to be put into salt rather than it being sprinkled onto the soil where they are.Other alternatives are nematode applications which target slugs, yet don't harm anything from soil to other creatures, but they aren't a cheap solution.You can certainly reduce the incidence of slug and snail damage by using things like copper bands and gritty or drying materials around plants, or encouraging particular forms of wildlife which will eat them - more info on that herehttp://www.saga.co.uk/lifestyle/gardening/masterclass/controlling-slugs-and-snails.aspx
Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
Have someone you trust watch the front of the car when you drive in, drive very slowly until they say "stop" when you are 4-5 inches from the wall, so you are in the garage enough.  Then back up, and do it again a few times. Once you're comfortable knowing how long your car is on the bit you can't see (lower front bumper), then drive in slowly and stop where you think you should, with the person watching to shout "stop" but only at the last minute.  I know 5-6 inches sounds like already the last minute, but once you have done this a few times you'll recognise that nearly half a foot leeway is actually quite a bit. And you only need to be less than 8 inches away from the wall, which is nearly 3/4 of a foot.This will teach you the length of the car, and will allow you to park your car anywhere. The tennis ball and sticks ideas are truly great, but they are not present at the supermarket, golf club, or other places you could park where there could also be limited room. Or where you want the car parked tight in so no-one catches the back with a trolley/other vehicle/etc.It also helps you have more confidence when pulling out of being parked between two cars (front and back) in a street.While you'd need to "re-learn" if you changed your car, you also have to reposition sticks and tennis balls too, but with this method, once you have the technique and experience, then learning a new car is pretty simple.  
How to stop water from dripping on the sink counter and bathroom floor when washing hands?
The small towel solution absorbs the puddle only until the towel is full, and then it's no better than no towel. Someone has to service the towel, making room for more absorption either by wringing it out or by replacing it with a dry one.I recommend adding a siphon that continually drains the towel.  Take a paper towel and fold it into a pointy triangle, using the same pattern by which you would make a paper airplane, but make 3 folds toward the center line instead of 2. Place the wide end under the towel on your counter and the other end down into the sink. Wet the siphon to get the flow started. The siphon will slowly drain the towel, lifting the water over the lip of the sink, and pulling it down to the siphon tip where it will fall off and proceed to the drain.
I need to prevent armpit stains in t-shirts. I want to apply something when I take the shirt off.
Well, I don't know if this applies to you or not, but I can guarantee it WILL apply to people who will choose to view this question in the future. That said, might I suggest a completely tangential approach? Forget trying to protect the shirt, regardless of remedies abound, I have never found any of them to work for me. Perhaps this is because I have hyperhydrosis (excessive sweating) and as a result, for many, MANY years I would ruin shirts continually and no advice anywhere was ever to avail me of the awful situation.About ten years ago, I found a product online called "Maxim Anti-Perspirant" and honestly, it was an amazing life-saver in so many ways. I don't use this product anymore as it is fairly expensive for the type of product that it is and I found a similar enough product that I can buy at Walgreen's, pretty much any other drug store as well or grocery stores. The brand I've been using now for the last 6 years or so is Certain-Dri. It comes in a stick or roll-on. You do have to make sure that you don't get the "A.M." one though as that does not work the same and intended for "refreshing." You have to put it on at night before bed, but after a few weeks, you only need to apply it every other day to every couple days depending... some people still have to use it every day, but that is less common. There are other brands out there as well such as "DrySol" and a few more that I cannot think of at the moment. If in fact, the reason you're having trouble with stains is excessive sweating, you really should try something like this! You will even feel much more self-confident with not having to be worrying about the sweat while out in public after a few days of use even. If this doesn't apply to you, I'm sorry, I wish I had a tried and true method, but as I mentioned, nothing ever worked for me and I sincerely hope that if not you, that at least someone in the future will find this information so that they will discover that it is not only invaluable, but utterly life-transforming!  
How to clean dirty white earphones
I hate to break it to you, but short of shaving or chemically melting off the outer layer of discolored plastic, you can't really remove that kind of discoloration. And that is if it only penetrated shallowly. If it was due to some kind of volatiles that were able to work themselves deeply into the polymer structures, then it is a total wash. But as mentioned at first, you could always try shaving off the outer layers carefully of course. I wouldn't try chemical means though as you stand a pretty good chance of actually driving the discoloration deeper.
How to stop water from dripping on the sink counter and bathroom floor when washing hands?
To avoid dripping water from your hands outside of the sink basin,shake water off your hands (with your palms facing you and fingers spread, flick your fingers downward several times), thenmove your hands quickly to the towel (or use the dispenser quickly) before the remaining water can gather into a drip.It is also possible to extend the time for which you can avoid drips by turning your hands to force the water to run across your skin rather than accumulating at a single low point into a drip. Pay attention to the feeling of the water on your skin, and keep it moving.

How to clean blood from white clothes
OxyClean (or other sodium percarbonate based product) works so well. The sodium percarbonate in it, when mixed with water actually releases hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and it also has soda ash in it which helps to boost the effectiveness of detergents and such.
How to clean blood from white clothes
If you live somewhere sunny, spread the cloth in the sunshine and sprinkle water on the stain. Keep it wet and the sun will bleach it out. Depending on the strength of the stain, it may take a few hours.This is the way our great-grandmothers did it. It has the advantage of being free and non-poisonous.

How can I clean a textured bathtub?
You need a limescale remover, but you need to select one that won't harm the surface - something like Limelite (available as a gel, spray or liquid) should do it if its available where you are (see link below), but there are others available. Apply and wait the requisite time, then try rinsing or wiping off some to see if its done the job - if not, leave it for longer. So long as its one that's suitable for plastic or acrylic, it won't cause damage even if you leave it 3 times as long. I know, I've done it...http://www.lime-lite.co.uk/products.php?id=3
Removing glare from monitor edges
With some own risk, use fine sandpaper. Though I've used sandpaper (well, SiC paper) on a shiny e-reader without problems, there is always the chance that a slip will scratch the screen.Aside: Why do manufacturers make display devices with glaring bezels, and worse yet, shiny screens? Camera lenses and eyeglasses have antireflective coatings, and high-quality optical devices are usually flat black.
Removing glare from monitor edges
It all depends. If you are into modding stuff, you could take the monitor apart and repaint it. If you aren't, take some matte black tape and tape over the edges. Problem solved.
How to keep laptop on your lap and still be safe?
Thick book - thats my solution. Being bit book lover, I always have some big and thick book nearby. Old encyclopedias come in mind easilyIts cheap (you already have at least one book at home, I assume)Fulfills the same as lap desk without investmentHelps protect you from the heat and other notebook radiation (even if the effect on human body is bit questionable, still "feeling safe" counts here)Helps protect your laptop from overheating. If you had it on your lap, the air vents could be blocked by your body and/or cushions, which can overheat your computer.
Driving into garage where there is little room for error?
FendersPut something soft on the wall, like a foam or rubber fender. Then you can drive, slowly, until you touch it.Even plastic bottles will do (depending on the gap). I've often seen boats with empty plastic bottles or fenders hanging all around to avoid scratching the boat when docking.You can combine the fenders with a noise/light signal. Just put a contact switch behind the fender, connected to some sort of light. When you touch the fender the light will go on and you'll know you have to stop.
Removing glare from monitor edges
Try some magic tape or matt tape of color/shade of choice. It needs some precision and finesse to put on with a good finish. Also get the right width that you can do it in one go and a seamless manner.Good thing about magic tape is you can always try it and remove it easily without leaving a trace if you change your mind later on.
How to remove/wash away instant glues if fallen in hand
Use rubbing alochol or nail polish remover. Both work exceptionally well for super glue and other sticky glues.
How to read in bed without upsetting my wife?
The e-book reader is already mentioned, as are the mini head/clip-on lamps.But I don't think anyone's suggested reading on your smartphone if you have one.  There are plenty of ebook reading apps you can get on your phone; some even have the option of having white text on a black background.  One thing to note if you use your phone is that phones emit high frequency light that keeps your brain active for up to 30 minutes after you stop looking at the screen.  There are other apps you can install on your phone so that it adjusts your screen to stop emitting these lights towards the end of the day (I have it just for normal phone use even when I'm not reading).Bonus lifehack: if you don't have a smartphone, get one that uses LED technology in its screen rather than an LCD.  LED's turn off their light source to display the color black whereas LCD's cover their light source with all subpixels to display black.  If you want a truer black color that's least abrasive, choose an LED/OLED technology screen smart phone. :)
How to read in bed without upsetting my wife?
The problem is that the light distracts your wife. Rather than getting a dimmer light, she could wear a sleep mask (if it was comfortable enough).
How to clean blood from white clothes
I imagine the stain is quite dry by now. Here's some options I know work, to be used alone or consecutively:Soak in cold water with a handful of salt, then wash as normal. (Optional: soak in bio detergent afterwards before using the washing machine.)Cover the stain in a paste of bicarbonate of soda and water. Salt and water is also said to work, though I've not tried it.As RedSonja says, the sun is magic. Put the shirt out with lemon juice or a lot of soap.Ammonia is great for organic stains. Soak in cold water, 1 tablespoon of ammonia per litre.Soak in water and bleach, or put a bit of bleach in the (cold) washing machine. The latter is less effective, but fine for removing faint stains. General rule: cold water. Cold washing machine, if there's any stain left. Hot water sets blood. Would-be murderers, take note.Don't mix ammonia and bleach. You will die. For future reference, if the blood is relatively recent:Stick the stain under a cold tap and rinse until the water is running clear again. Wet a bar of soap and rub it hard on the stain. I save the slivers from old bars for this: the sharp edges make it faster. When you have a good thick lather, scrub the stain hard between your fists, cloth against cloth. Repeat steps 2 and 3, rinsing occasionally, until you think there's nothing more you can do. By this point I've usually worked even very heavy bloodstains down to a faint yellow mark. Use one of the other methods to finish the job. (If you're going to wait overnight, put it in a basin of water so it won't dry out.)
How to remove/wash away instant glues if fallen in hand
Super glues which dry instantly can be removed using salon-strength nail polish remover, very high in acetone and used to remove gel finish manicures.  Salon strength and gel removers are almost pure acetone, unlike regular nail polish remover. This will dry your skin if used often and is a very flammable substance so be careful.
What can be used to remove make-up?
Many types of make-up are oil-based, so just use mineral oil (or even vegetable oil) to remove it. Put the oil on cotton, facial tissue or face towels. (Just be careful to wash a cloth immediately, as oily rags are a fire hazard.) You could use fancy prepared oil-based skin cleansers, but vegetable oil is kinder to the skin. Avoid harsh cleaners.
How can I prevent condensation on the toilet flush tank?
I ran a mix of hot and cold water to my toilet. No more condensation at all,and no mould around or under the toilet even where you cant see it. No more cold toilet seat. Instant hot water to the sink after a flush. Well worth it!
How to remove a hard boiled egg's shell quickly, by hand, without damaging the egg?
I've found a brilliant trick in a Japanese cookbook (Japanese Soul Cooking):Before boiling the eggs, make a tiny hole on the bottom using a needle. While cooking the air in the egg will come out and the water will separate the skin from the egg.They then peel in a few secs.
How to remove really old masking tape?
It would depend on what type of finish is on the furniture. If it is an enamel, some kind of solid material laminate or polyurethane finish, then you're most likely golden! You can just use a product like "goof off" or "goo gone" and that will take it off nicely and won't harm a typical polyurethane finish. Now, that said, I would still test a spot to make sure it won't harm the finish in case it is actually some other polymer.If it is a more traditional finish, you could try these, but there is a good change of disrupting at least the finish if not the stain as well. If you are really careful you can keep that damage to a minimum or possibly if you lightly dab for some timeframe around forever, maybe not even at all. But again, test it first! You never know, you might find it is compatible with whatever other finish type was used. But always test in some non-obvious place. Also, if you do damage the finish, sometimes you can repair that with various "refinishing" products that you can find at your local hardware store. Incidentally, you can also find "Goof Off" and "Goo Gone" at a typical hardware store as well. Good Luck!
How to read in bed without upsetting my wife?
As an alternative to the above suggestions, which seem to focus mainly on reducing the amount of light being cast into the room, have you considered trying any of the following;Try an audio book.  Many novels are available in an audio format and if you get some decent in-ear headphones, there should be no noise in the room.Try reading downstairs before you come to bed, provided that you are able to get into bed without waking your wife.Learn braille, a braille book can be read in total darkness.Get a divorce, removing the wife from the equation would be one solution.Okay, some of my suggestions are a little tongue in cheek, although they would all be effective.  Definitely consider trying an audio book.

How to write in a straight line without lined paper?
Since 5th grade I have been able to freakishly write cursive in a straight line on plain paper.Freakishly is a term I heard from a lady commenting on my writing.My teacher in 5th grade explained to me to write with my arm and not wrist. meaning keep your wrist straight, do not bend it when writing. Practice does make a lot of difference as well.

How to prevent creases and imprints while hanging clothing to dry to prevent ironing?
They sell those close hanging racks for that very purpose with multiple bars that you just lay the item over the bar. I do this all the time for items that cannot be dried and they don't leave any marks. They sell drying racks at any multi-purpose store like Target. Mine is made of smooth coated aluminum and has about 8 bars, with each able to fit one garment. It folds up to flat and weighs only a couple lbs at most!If you have no drier you'd probably need a couple. For light blouses and materials that dry super fast, I sometimes just go right to a foam lined hanger.The iron or not to iron question is one of preference. I only iron stuff that is wrinkled or something like a cotton dress shirt that looks crisper with a fresh pass with the steam setting. But no, there is no reason you should otherwise.
What can I use to clean my electric iron with?
I presume you are talking about an electric iron for pressing clothes.We found a product which is specifically designed for this purpose.  There are several variants but the one we use comes in a tube and is applied hot with a cloth.  It leaves a protective coating so the residue doesn't reoccour straight away.I don't know if product specific links are allowed in this site but assuming they are, the specific one we use is this; Faultless Hot Iron Cleaner
How to clean dirty white earphones

How can I detach the zipper pulls on my suitcase and attach them to zipper sliders?
If your zipper is anything like the one in the picture, you can see a seam on it that indicates that it is moulded or sintered rather than machined or pressed from a tempered metal. This means it is brittle so applying to much force will cause it to  snap rather than bend. A safer option would be to attach a split ring from a key ring.
What can I use to clean my electric iron with?
Salt! You can use it to clean the sticky residue from the bottom of the iron.Put a paper towel on your ironing table. Pour some salt over it. Turn on the iron to its highest setting with the steam completely off. Once hot and ready, rub the iron over the salt and the sticky residue will start coming off onto the salt. Replenish salt if needed and continue until clean.If some salt gets around the holes, just iron a thick towel to get it off. Most kinds of normal iron sticky residue will come off using this technique. Depends on what got burned there and there could be some that are tougher.

What can be used to remove make-up?
Depends how sensitive you are - most eye make up removers are oil based, and they make my eyes swell up. I just use facial wipes, the ones sold for general make up remover, and clean eye make up off with those too, works fine. I always choose Johnson's Dry Skin (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Johnsons-Face-Makeup-Moisturising-Wipes/dp/B00G3JNU8Q) ones because some of the other makes (L'Oreal, Olay) cause a reaction. Not sure if you can get them where you are, otherwise, Simple facial wipes.
How to make Ice melt slower?
The point is to have cool air, using a large block of ice might prolong the life of the block but perhaps a smaller block can reach the same cooling results. Therefor, break the block into the sizes that get the job done, and the rest leave in the freezer.Every time the block melts, replace it with what you have in your freezer. Its easier to freeze smaller blocks of ice. In addition , packing the ice box with dry ice around the ice block will prolong the life of the block. But check if its ok to breath that stuff. 
What can I use to clean my shower head?
To get the built up residue off of your shower head, tie a bag filled with vinegar around the shower head, and leave it there overnight. It will clean everything off with no work involved.Voila!!
How to remove really old masking tape?
One of my favourite methods removing glue residue from tapes is using another tape. It involves no solvents and thus cannot harm varnish.I use to take some piece of tape, place it over the glue residue and pull it off. sometimes it is better to pull it fast, if the residue is rather hard. If the residue is soft, pulling gently may be better. I made the experience, that it doesn't make a big difference if you rub the tape onto the residue, or not. But the outcome may vary. You will have to do this several times, depending on the age of the residue. I prefer to use duct tape, because its glue is soft and thick which lets it grab even irregularily shaped glue residuebut other tapes may work, too. Beware of cheap tapes as they sometimes loose their glue, worsening the situation. A piece of tape may be used several times depending on its type and amount of dust on the surfaces. If that doesn't help you can still try cleaners based on orange oil. Those have removed any tape residue I met! But be aware that orange oil is a powerful solvent, so test it on a covert spot. A brand available in a typical "Bioladen" is "AlmaWin"
What can I use to keep my daughter from falling off the bed?
You can use a bed rail, which is a board or rail mounted on the side of the bed frame. Think of it as a removable headboard for the sides of the bed.Here's a general purpose one that you can buy commercially:Alternatively, you can make your own pretty easily. Just get a board of wood and prop it between the side of the mattress and the bed frame.
What can I use to clean my shower head?
Chlorine bleach works to whiten and brighten plastic shower heads.  Perhaps of related interest, apparently chlorine doesn't kill some types of microbes, but it will look clean.Link to bacteria in showerheads article.

How to remove really old masking tape?
Provided the finish is smooth, I've found a razor blade to work nicely.  I've had success cleaning varnished, glass, lacquered, melamine, and epoxy finishes.
What can I use to keep my daughter from falling off the bed?
In case anyone doesn't have the budget for a suitable bedrail, cheaper alternatives are:Buy a couple of swimming pool noodles and put them along the edges of the bed under the sheet. The sheet does need to be a fitted one (and fairly tight fitting) to hold them in place but it works well.Put pillows or a rolled up duvet on the floor - rather than preventing her falling out in the first place, it simply ensures she doesn't hurt herself if she does fall out
How to get cat pee smell out of a camera
There is Electrical Cleaner that is a solvent used to clean electronics without risking damage by corrosion. However, before processing with that route... I would advise to wipe the external shell of your camera as much as you possibly can to make sure you haven't missed a spot of residue. It does not take much urine to have a strong smell stick to your camera (clean cracks and crevices)If the problem still persist, you may need to take the camera apart (or to camera shop) and have them clean it with solvent used for electrical components. Look up "Electrical cleaner" in google to find many useful products with reviews.
Cleaning MicroUSB socket on mobile phone
You should use a toothpick, previously buffed with a fine sandpaper. You can use other objects, but with the toothpick you can do it without turning off the phone because it isn't a electrical conductor and you can also sharpen the tip very easily to get better access to the areas. Clean the area in blue...Pay close attention to the left and ride side of the usb port where the bolts fit and attach to the cable (labeled in RED)To prevent this in the future you can purchase a Nexus protective case that has a FLAP for the usb charging port to prevent debris from congesting that area.

How can I fix a clogged toilet without calling a plumber?
When your toilet clogs up, squeeze at least three squirts of dish washing liquid into the bowl. The chemicals can help to break up the debris. Pour around four cups of hot water into the bowl.Let everything soak for a while (20 minutes to a few hours) before attempting to flush. I've actually tried this and it works!!
Prevent Smelly Sponges
I have been plagued by smelly sponges for years. My sponges start to smell within a day of use and nothing works at removing the smell for more than a day.Alas, I just found a website where many people are claiming the problem to be with particular dish soaps. This makes a great deal of intuitive sense. If the dish soap is the problem no other steps to remove the smell will keep it from quickly coming back.Here's the link:http://www.stain-removal-101.com/dawn-smelly-sponges.html
How can I clean my backpack?
I wash my backpacks and reusable bags once in a while to keep the fresh and clean. Usually I turn my bags upside down to shake off all the debris that's in there or sticky roll the inside. After getting the bigger pieces of the debris out, I just fill a large container/sink with water and soap then put the bags in there. Depends on the size of your backpack, you need to make sure there's enough room for it to roll around in there. Soak it for a bit, then just wash it like how you would hand wash clothes, except you don't want to press or bend it too hard. You need to make sure not to bend the rigid structure of your bag. If there are stains you want to get rid off, usually for the material of backpacks, you can use a toothbrush, dip it in some soap and brush the stains off. If it's a tougher stain, you can use a more specific stain removing detergent. If a toothbrush is too small, then you can use a gentle bigger brush. After swooshing it in water for a bit to get smaller debris out or get the dust and stains off, just rinse it a couple times and you are done. If you don't think it will survive a drying, just hang it upside down with all zippers open to air dry. 
Is there a neater way to fold a shirt?
I use something like this: You lay the shirt on it, fold in the sides, then the bottom, and you have a nice, flat, pretty perfectly folded shirt. Once you get the hang of it, you can fold a lot of shirts pretty quickly. 
Unlock a suitcase with a possible broken lock
Perhaps a bit risky for the lock, but you could use a thin bit with a dremel tool and cut the bolt/pin hold the zippers together.As you've stated, a small padlock between the zipper pull tabs would help secure it after the fact.Holroy's suggestion of trying all the combos may also work if the lock isn't broken and you're patient/persistent; I estimate that there would be 1000 possibilities (10^3) for a 3 digit lock with 0-9 for each tumbler.
What can I use to keep my daughter from falling off the bed?
For very cheap (like possibly under $30), if you already have a drill and saw, you could simply use some 2 x 4's, screws, and create your own railings.Depending on size of bed this would probably take anywhere from 4-8 8ft 2x4's and at least 14 screws (or I guess even wood glue could work so no screws or drill needed).The 3 horizontal 2x4's that connect the side rails to each other would be placed between the mattress and the bed bottom. I don't think there'd be much comfort-ability issues with this as long as the mattress is decent enough. You'd want to make sure that the side rails are pretty tight/close to the mattress on each side, so not much any room for sliding issues. You could even paint/stain/finish the piece to make it look however you prefer.

How to tell a technical support call center worker that I am technically inclined?
Well, unfortunately, you could tell them you're Bill Gates, but they'd still try to take you through the usual litany of turn it off and on again, check the connections, blah blah. Most of the 'technical support' people you talk to on the phone aren't techies at all, they're just ordinary people with a list in front of them that they take you through by rote, because they don't know anything. And it is fair to say that many of the calls they get are from people who've forgotten to connect something up, haven't read the instructions, or haven't turned the power switch on.You could try telling them you're a software/hardware engineer or a Chief Technical Officer or something similar, and ask to be put through to an engineer who actually knows something.
Is there a neater way to fold a shirt?
If you search for how to fold a shirt in under 2 seconds you'll find lots of videos and references on how to fold a shirt quickly without the need of anything but a shirt and a table (or flat surface). One of the top references is the video from  DaveHax.com, which has spun off into multiple other sites. The image below is constructed from pictures from the video, and I found the compilation at http://www.howtoinstructions.org/how-to-fold-a-shirt-in-under-2-seconds/:My written instructions to accompany this picture are as follows:After putting the shirt on a table, imagine a line at the middleThen imagine another line from top to bottom at an quarter from the leftName the points from top to bottom as B at the shoulder, A at the crossing section, and C at the bottom of shirtPinch at A with your left hand, and pick up B with your right handMove right hand over and pick up CLift both hands in a swift motion, and move it a little away from youPut it down on the table again, with a little drag towards yourself, before folding it back completing the foldWatch your nicely folded shirt, before putting it awayThe instructions are somewhat lengthy, but once you get the hang of it, you'll do it almost without thinking. I've been using this technique for some years now, and found it to be very efficient.An extension to this folding technique it lift by the upper part, and fold it yet another time. This allows for an even smaller package, and can be used if you want to stack the shirts in a drawer, where each shirt can be readily accessible. To fold it this extra times, does also make the folded shirt slight more stable.Finally, this technique can also be used on long sleeved shirts, with the addition of folding the long sleeves an extra time on top of the rest of the shirt.
What can be used to remove make-up?
I suggest you to use organic products  You can use olive oil, vinegar with water, instead of the harsh chemical ones on your skin. You can even make your own makeup remover just refer to the video https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bMSKRpiUZWE You can easily find the items on your household. 
Preventing paper towel waste by tightening the roll
Me and my friend have been found a solution. The way is very basic and economical. The plastic spare is a part of 19LT water bottle. With only 8 screws, we can bring three woods together and put some glue for making strong each other. Now, nobody can hold lots of towel, it is limited by the plastic part.

How to test if humidity meter works
Most inexpensive relative humidity (RH) meters are very slow to respond, and many are not very accurate. What should be the most important observation is how you feel on days when the RH is high or low. You can make your own hair hygrometer quite easily, and this will respond to RH more rapidly and more reliably than the "store-bought" Metal-paper coil type variety. 
Easier way to remove the stem from a strawberry?

What can replace a shoehorn?
In general most items which are reasonable flat and narrow can be used as replacements for a shoehorn. Items like rulers, a suitable stick, large wooden spoons, or similar items. If you are in a real pinch, you could use other kitchen utensils, like pie cutter, sausage tongs. Anything long and flat could do.On an alternative approach, you could try using your belt. It is not as sturdy, but usually they are easily found and accessible. Just insert the belt end into the shoe, and use as normal. 
Unlock a suitcase with a possible broken lock
Why mess with the lock? I think, assuming that your suitcase has a regular zipper, that you could bend the crown out so that the pull tab would be locked, and it would be difficult to undo the zipper, but not impossible... Anatomy of a zipper http://www.seattlefabrics.com/Structure%20of%20a%20Zipper.jpgThis has the benefit of not destroying anything (provided you don't bend the crown too much!)

No,there is not a reliable hack to measure the body temperature in a sensible way.We have to distinguish two case where an exact body temperature may matter:Is there a rise in body temperature at all?We won't be able to tell whether a body temerature rose to more than 37.5 °C (99.5° F) - the lower limit of fever - without a thermometer measuring at 0.1° precision.Is there a threatening rise in temperature?Fever greater than 41.5°C (106.7°F) usually comes from a serious unlerlying disease and may cause harm to our body. In this case we need to seek medical advice. We won't be able to tell without a thermometer if that was the case already.But,of course there a limited "hacks" that may tell us something is wrong, and we may have a fever.Other people tell us we feel "warm".It is important to realise that we can not feel our own temperature, as our hands get warmer with the fever as well, and we can only feel a difference in temperature in relation to our skin temperature. With some experience we may be able to feel that somebody else hase an almost normal body temperature, may have fever above 39°C, or has a high fever above 40°C.Our usual room temperature suddenly feels cold.Now this is very limited, but on a rising body temperature we subjectively feel cold, but as soon as the temperature falls we start to sweat. Therfore this will not tell us anything about our absolute temperature.The heart beat rate may rise.According to the Liebermeister's rule the cardiac frequency rises by 8 to 10 beats per minute for every Celsius grade rise in body temperature. Obviously this rule is only applicable in case we rest, we do know our normal heart beat rate, and there is no other underlying cause of an altered cardiac frequency. The precision of this rule is more than doubtful.So whenever we have the feeling that we may have a fever we should go and measure our body temperature with a medical thermometer. All else will not really tell us much more than what we already know: we may be ill today.
How to deal with an uneven bathroom floor?
When fixing the room is out of the question, as you suggest, you have two options left in my book:Reduce the water spillContain spill water as good as possibleReducing water spillIt goes without saying that you should try not to splash water around, but this should go into the sink, and not onto the floor. That leaves three common sources: 1) Shower, 2) Washing machine and possibly 3) clothes drying.Regarding the washing machine if you don't have it already, please get a hose so that you can redirect the spill water into the toilet bowl, sink or closer to the drain.If possible avoid clothes drying in the bathroom, or ensure that there is good ventilation which help moist get out of the bathroom instead of accumulating and forming droplets. Avoid hanging up dripping clothes by either wringing them or giving them an extra run through the sentrifuge.Containing spill waterFor the shower, which hopefully is close to the drain, you have two different paths to go. You could opt for buying yourself out of the problem by acquiring a shower cabinet, which contains all the water and you can control the spill water to go into the drain.The other path, is to use shower curtains to reduce the wet area, and in addition you can add a shower edge guard just outside of the shower curtains.Some alternative options for shower edge guard:The best, when not using a shower cabinet, would be a low bricked edge, but this would change the physical bathroom so is most likely not a viable option whilst rentingLists of various materials can also be used, i.e. rubber or plastic guardsIn a pinch, you can even use a long wet towel which you roll together to form the guard preventing the water from extending into the wrong side of the bathFinally you need to take care when drying your self to stay in the wet area, where the drain is, and avoid dragging water all over. So before taking the bath, make sure that you have the necessary stuff readily available, so you don't have to cross the bathroom to get stuff like a dry towel.
How do I remove a Daddy Long-Legs egg sac without breaking it open or killing the spiders?
Use a pencil or other small stick to gently poke at the female spider so that she crawls away from the eggs. Her self preservation should be more important to her than defending her eggs sacs.Then you can reach in with some tweezers or perhaps even twist and wrap up the eggs and some of the webbing on the end of the pencil or stick and pull the eggs out of the web.
Compensating for uneven flooring in a house
For bed, desk and other "fix" furniture, you could use felt pads.They're cheap, easy to install and replace.If you need more than one, I suggest applying as many as needet minus one, use a nail to keep em in place and stack the last felt pad to prevent the nail from scratching your floor.The chair is more of a problem. If the chair is at a relatively fixed location you could do the same, but mention turning the chair by 90°. Then the chair would wobble even more.So here you really have to even the floor.One way to do so could be a rug.Put some newspaper under the rug at lower levels to raise them a litte.Of course this only works for some mm befor getting ugly, but for heigher uneveness the only good solution is leveling compound which isn't a hack.
What can I use to clean my shower head?
Usually I use citric acid for almost any obstinately pollution like limestone.It's very cheap and the low doses you use in household needs won't harm the environment.Usage is simple:Take a bucket.Fill it with water.Add about 1-3 teaspoon per liter, depending on how strong the pollution is.Pour.Insert the dirty object.Leave it be for some hours, e.g. if you're at work.  Avoid eyecontact!Citric acid is mildly irritating, so avoid long skincontact, better wear gloves. But you don't have to panic if you go something on your skin. Simply wash it away. Unless you keep your hand in the bucket for several minutes, you shouldn't notice anything.
How do I remove a Daddy Long-Legs egg sac without breaking it open or killing the spiders?
Many spiders which are carrying their youngsters will drop them if in panic.Basicly you don't want that to happen uncontrolled.Catch the Spider with a glas and a piece of paper, just like you would catch a bee or something.Now you can use a pencil to make the big one angry. Be annoying, until the spider attacks the pencil. At one point, the spider will release the eggsack.Now you can pull out the large spider with your pencil, and put the eggs whereever you want to (outside?)
How do I remove a Daddy Long-Legs egg sac without breaking it open or killing the spiders?
Capture the spider carrying the egg sac in a clear jar or tub, like those you buy cold things in at the grocery store or a medium-sized Chinese restaurant soup takeout container (after cleaning it out).I recommend plastic instead of glass so that it won't break if you make any sudden movements etc.Slide a paper under the glass as it's against the wall/ceiling/floor, so the big spider climbs on to it with the egg sac.Then put something stiffer under the paper to help keep it flat against the bottom of the jar, and carry the mother and her sac all together outside. Set it all down, tip over the jar and if necessary gently tap to encourage the mother to climb out.  
Compensating for uneven flooring in a house
In general, you can't do anything! Is the house uneven, then it is uneven, and needs fixing. You can always pad or build under the different furniture to some extent, but that mainly works for stationary furniture like a bed or desk.When it comes to more mobile furniture like tables and/or chairs, these are not so easy to stabilise. Besides considering to build a new floor (possibly on top of the other floor), which doesn't seem like it is an viable option for you, mathematics has an interesting option, namely rotate the chair or table.According to this article Strange but True: Turning a Wobbly Table Will Make It Steady, you'll be able to get all four legs in contact with the floor, aka being stable, with simple rotation of the table. Rotation, however, does not guarantee that the table/chair is level afterwards. So then it becomes a choice of the lesser evil: wobbly chair or uneven chair.(added) On the feeling of balanceNote that the feeling of balance is not only physical. Objects can be level, but due to the surroundings they might feel unbalanced. In those cases you just have to adjust according to sense, or get used to the feeling.When using a level, you use it on the object you want to make level, and then lift either end of the level to see where you need to compensate. Say that you need to lift the left edge of it, then you need to put more padding under the left edge of the object as well. 
How to remove really old masking tape?
Perhaps something "low tech" would work: try saturating the spots with a drop or two of olive oil and letting it sit for a few minutes before scraping with your fingernail. 
Easier way to remove the stem from a strawberry?
I like a bird's-beak parer, but a vegetable peeler will work pretty well for this. Use it point-first to make a circular cut around the stem, which will come right out. I use this technique for a number of other things - removing eyes from potatoes, scooping blemishes out of fruit, etc. 
What can replace a shoehorn?
Inspired by this post, I tried using some cardboard from a box of pasta.  It worked pretty well.  I don't think it will last forever, but there is plenty more cardboard produced through normal purchases.Fold the box flat by open the ends.Mold the box into a curved shape similar to that of a shoehorn.Insert into shoe, and your foot should slide in to the shoe.I think a box of macaroni might work best based on the width; something around 3-4 inches is ideal.
How to remove really old masking tape?
I have had good success with baby oil (just regular Johnson's baby oil). Layer on a goodly amount with a cotton ball. Then wait 30-60 minutes for the oil to soften the glue. Once it is soft try wiping the mess off with a microfibre cloth. Good luck. 
How to stick a photo to a glass?
If you take a look on how glue works, you'll notice two things:  Glue pulls together smooth surfaces by an effect, similar to the capillary effect.  Glue increases the surface between two objects by filling the unevenness of the objects. generates a high friction and thus sticks. When you try to move an object above an surface, friction depends on what percentage of surface are facing each other. Usually, while sliding one above another, you tilt one of the objects and lower friction by that. A water film prevents the objects from tilt and even if water itself is a (weak) lubricant and lowers friction, atmospheric pressure will push the objects together (while water will pull it together) which are hard to remove without breaking the film.Both are effects which water is capable in a limited factor, too.So before you try anything, paying money for stuff that doesn't work, ill suggest trying water at first.Don't make the surfaces dripping wet, but you should moisten them a little.If you have a spray, from glass cleaner for example, spray a little, not too much, water from a longer range (like 1 meter or more).You don't want it to be wet, but moist.Then simply attach the picture to the moist surface, it will stick very well if not too heavy.
How would I filter rainwater to substitute having to buy distilled water?
Rainwater can hold dirt and other debris when it amkes contact with surfaces that are capturing the rain (roof etc)You can always filter them using 2-3 coffee filters to filter out the debris, and then use that for your iron, and other applications that need to use 'distilled' water.

How to wash your rubber shoes
I have used fingernail polish remover (acetone) and a tooth brush to clean the rubber part of my Chuck Taylor's and it has worked like a charm.  I suggest you try soaking a rag in fingernail polish remover and rubbing it over the rubber parts of your shoes and follow it up with a tooth brush or other small brush.  
How to fix a nylon zipper that opens itself in the middle?
Most likely, no!  If a nylon zipper has lost the grip, you'll need to replace it. How difficult and time consuming it is, depends on the clothing. In our family, where my father has been doing upholstery, and my mother is doing embroidering we've changed some zippers.And those zippers which are changeable, can usually be done in an hour or two. Definition of doable heavily depends on the clothing, and how neatly you want it done.

How to fire a matchstick without matchbox
You can fire it from another source of fire. It will catch fire by itself and light easily.If this isn't a possibility, you can try either striking on rough materials(rocks, sandpaper, some walls):Or, you can create a spark that will reach the match. This should do(actually, this is a minimalistic version of fire).
Open closed zipper without pull tab
Use a paper clip - If the zipper is not stuck and the issue is just with a pull tab missing or not being functional.Insert it into the area where the pull tab attaches with the zipper slider and it will perform just like the pull tab. For zippers that need a lot of force, use proportionately stronger paper clips.I have used this successfully for opening suitcases that have missing pull tabs.

How to remove a hard boiled egg's shell quickly, by hand, without damaging the egg?
Once the egg is boiled enough, pour a lot of cold water over it (about 30 seconds under the tap stream would do). Then grab the egg and gently smash it with a teaspoon all over around until it looks reasonably beaten up. Now place it on a flat surface and press gently with your opened palm; move your hand back and forth to roll the egg on the surface to crack the shell even more(about 10 seconds is enough). Now start peeling - I made the egg peel in one continuous piece using this method.Good luck!
Can I obtain that jeans color with bleach?
Yes, you can if I am understanding. Putting Bleach in your washer is not the method. This will bleach the whole jeans and probably do it unevenly. This is the method: http://m.wikihow.com/Bleach-JeansGet a 1 to 3 bleach solution and carefully apply in the pattern you want. Apply by spray bottle, sponges, or painting. Whichever you want and is better for the design. Tie off the areas you are not doing and wrap those in plastic wrap or bags. Not Neccesary, but I am very careful. Bleach cannot be undone. Wash the jeans after, but be sure to rinse the area with bleach to get most of it out before washing them so the whole jeans don't get bleached. Try doing at least 2 or 3 treatments, so you can go slow and do not try do in it all at once just in case you do much and ruin them. For the design your going for I would say at least 2 sessions and a sponge. If misunderstood you and you want to lighten the whole jeans I would say:http://www.mademan.com/mm/how-fade-jeans-home.htmlPut about a pint and a half in your washer and let that site for about 20 to 30 minutes. Start the washer again.You can always do extra sessions. So to much can be much. Note: Some say Bleach pen. But that can look really "unnatural". I reserve that for lettering and bleaching emergencies :) 
How to heat up two bowls in a microwave?
You could simply use a non-metallic rack to place the other bowl on top of the first one.Do also note that heating two bowls, will take a little more than double the time of heating the one bowl, so it might not be worth the trouble. (Similar to heating the double amount, is a little more than the time used for the original amount)Regarding what to use as a rack, which is readily available in a home, it depends on size of bowls and size of microwave:Ideally, you buy a specific rack made for the purposeSome microwave ovens comes with a lid to use over the food. This can, if you don't obstruct the air flow, be used as the rackYou could try balancing the other bowl on top of the other using chop sticks layed parallell on top of the first bowlYou could use skewer sticks stuck through plastic glasses, or somehow interconnected to build a proper frame/rackI've also seen a triple bowl arrangement used, where the first bowl is placed of center, the second empty bowl is turned upside down and placed next to the first bowl, and then the third bowl is placed on top of the second bowl and possibly the rim of the first bowlSimilar to the previous where you have your first bowl placed of center, and then something which fits your rotating plate and has the same height as your bowl placed next to it, and then finally the second bowl placed on top of the non-metallic height adjustment thingy and the rim of the other bowlAll these suggestions are based on bowls, where the content is below the rim of the bowl. As such, it can't be easily done with plates. With plates you need do get/build/... the rack so that the food doesn't touch the other plate.

Cleaning a blood stain from a silk tie
I have experience washing silk product and cleaning blood stains. I never take my clothing to dry cleaner, so I have plenty of experience washing delicate material such as silk and wool.The rule for washing off blood stains is to use cold(normal tap temperature) water. Warm water make the cell membrane of red blood cells to rupture, and making blood stain harder to be removed. I usually just hand wash silk products with cold water. As of detergent, normal detergent, or just hand soap works. If the stain is too stubborn, I would soak it for a while before washing the fabric. When it comes to actually washing and rubbing off the stain, you just need to put a bit more detergent on the blood stain, then gently rub different parts of the tie against each other to rub the stain off.If you see the stain is getting rubbed off a little, then just repeat the process. I hope this helps, if the stain refuse to go away, maybe consider some special blood stain removing treatment for silk or buy a new tie?

How to remove really old masking tape?
I recommend soaking the offending tape in any of the following: (in order of weakest to strongest) methanol, isopropanol, acetone, or either xylene or toluene. Keep in mind that all of these give off rather nasty fumes, being strong solvents. Besides that, they should get your tape off rapidly, especially if you opt for xylene or toluene.Please keep in mind though, that any of these products is likely to strip the paint and/or varnish off anything you use them on.Another thing you could try (though I can't guarantee it'll work) is to liberally paint turpentine on the aforementioned crusty tape. Again, it will probably strip your varnish off, but shouldn't damage the wood underneath.I know someone mentioned solvents already, but these solvents are readily available in most countries (rather than the proprietary Goo Gone and Goof Off, which may or may not be available depending on where you live), with the notable exception of maybe Poland, seeing as even diethyl ether is regulated there.
Organising ties in closet
You can use a tie rack or make your own. The core concept is pretty simple: instead of hanging your ties on a line (like a clothes hanger), hang them in a grid.Here's an example of one that is commercially available:If you don't want to buy one, you are still in luck. As I said, the idea is pretty simple, and it's pretty easy to make your own.Use any grid-like object you have lying around, whether it is a toaster oven rack or a section of chain-link fence or a wire storage grid square. I recommend the last one in particular. If you want to hang it with the rest of your clothes, you can tie or glue it to a hanger.

If you've got drawer space, roll 'em up and store them as demonstrated herehttps://effortlessgent.com/how-to-store-pocket-squares-ties-belts-cufflinks-accessories/There's a link within that link to a compartment separator to hold such things as rolled up ties, belts and the like, but Ikea sells those too.
How to clean inside of straw
I would put the straw in a container that would allow it to be completely submerged with water. Fill it up, then add a denture tablet or two. Wait. When it comes out, it should be clean and smell minty. Repeat as needed.You could also try submerging in a tub of white vinegar.
Organising ties in closet
I have always found it harder to hang up a tie on a rod in a closet than on a doorknob, or a simple wall hook. But I only own 3 or 4 ties. 5 to 10 wall hooks might take up a bit more space.When I do put a tie on a closet rod, I loop it once (loose tie) to keep it in place so it does not fall... Much better than hanging loosely.
How to stop shoes from squeaking on hard floors?
I honestly have never had this problem. Ever. But if I did, I think the first thing I would try would to make the bottom of my shoe less slick(perfect). It seems to me that two slick surfaces squeak way more than one that is slick and one that is a little rougher.I would think a cheap, FINE grained sandpaper for just a couple of seconds on the bottom of the shoe should do it. I would be careful not to take the whole sole of the shoe off, that would be sad. :)
How to stop shoes from squeaking on hard floors?
When a shoe starts making squeaking noises, this is because two parts of the shoe are rubbing against each other and sticking, when they should be sliding smoothly.Thus, lubricant of some form is called for. A quick Google search tells me that baby powder and WD-40 are both recommended for this job, though I'm sure plenty of other lubricants would work just fine.First, identify what part of the shoe the squeaking noises are coming from. Next, apply lubricant, work it in, and you're done. If it is underneath the sole of the shoe, make sure to lift up the sole before applying the lubricant.Edit: Make sure to wipe any leftover lubricant off of the bottom of your shoe so your shoe doesn't lose any traction.
How to stop shoes from squeaking on hard floors?
One option could be to add an extra layer of rubber on your soles. There exists rubber sole spray which are made for either fixing soles, giving better traction to soles, improve winter shoes, and so on. This extra layer would most likely remove the squeaking.Just to verify that it is actually the outer soles which are squeaking, you could try adding duct tape to the bottom of the shoes, and see if that is a doable quick-fix. If it does fix it, look around for either a local shoe repair shop or go online and see if you can't find a suitable rubber sole spray. PS! Have you tried asking at your local shoe repair shop if they have any suggestions? Advice is often free, you know
How to only take off your pullover without the garment below it?
Put your shirt into your pantsTake off your pulloverPull your shirt out of the pantsIf the shirt is still moving up put your shirt round about into your pants.Just a simple trick :)
How to only take off your pullover without the garment below it?
You could:Take your arms out of the sleeves first. Then you can use your hands to keep your shirt on better. You can use one hand to keep it on and use one hand to take it off. Or you can push the shirt down or tuck it in and pull the pullover first. For these methods,  if you are wearing a long sleeved shirt you can grab your sleeves so they don't come off. Tips: Have a size shirt that fits you. To tight can be the difference in your shirt coming off. Loosen the shirt from your other shirt first before attempting to take it off. Sometimes the shirts can get stuck together and they come off together. Get someone to help you, if you think that it is going to be a really hard job. This may look weird, but you can always do it in a bathroom or away from the public. 
How to refreshen when you sleep too much or sleep in the afternoon?
A common hack to this would be to drink coffee or another source of caffeine, then go back and take a 15 min nap. Wake up when your alarm hits 15 mins...humans sleep in 90 min cycles this is scientifically proven.The goal here is, drink coffee, take a power nap, after 15 mins, your body starts reacting to the caffeine and in turn will boost your awareness. 
How to refreshen when you sleep too much or sleep in the afternoon?
This happens to me too! I love taking afternoon naps and sometimes, I wake up feeling extremely tired and more sleepy. What I do is to drink a cup of water, then eat juicy or crispy fruit from the fridge, such as an apple, orange, or grapes. It take a bit time for my body to wake up. Sometimes if I feel like it, I would take a shower as well. Usually eating fruit works for me. Hope this helps! :D 
How to only take off your pullover without the garment below it?
One way to take off your pullover is to start lifting it at the hip, and then kind of rolling it over your head, and finally pull out your hands. This method does however require you turn the pullover inside out afterwards. As you lift it from the waist, instead of pulling it directly off from the top, any garment under usually stays put. You could tuck the t-shirt in your pants during the operation for extra protection, but most often it isn't necessary. 
What's the best way to keep your shirt tucked in?
I presume you are wearing an undershirt under your dress shirt and, if so, then...Tuck your undershirt inside your underwear, thenPull on your trousers or slacks or jeans, thenTuck your dress shirt into your pants, button up, zip up and fasten your          belt.I was told this method by a tailor more than 30 years ago and it has kept me looking neat, and it should work for you as well.  Good luck.
How to only take off your pullover without the garment below it?
First, I lift up the sweater just below my chest area so my shirt is exposed. Then, I move over towards a table/ledge of some sort, pin the shirt between my body and the ledge, and pull off the rest of the sweater. You can also, if for some reason there are no desks, tables, ledges, etc., lean against a wall and pin your shirt to it (curve your back or lean, if necessary).Describing it makes it seem a lot harder than it is, but usually you can find a desk or something to do it on.

How to make an ethernet cable with a broken clip usable?
You always have the option of using gaffa or duct tape to fasten it, and if you don't want to fasten it in the computer end then simply reverse the cable. If you don't like using tape on the cable, reversing could still be an option as it might be less tension in the other end. You could also opt for using a tooth pick or similar to apply a little pressure within the contact. Do take care not to destroy the contact, as that will me a lot more costly rather than replacing the cable. 
Makeshift stand for large tablet
After first just leaning against a larger box, where the iPad kept slipping when touched,  I considering using a silicone heat brick so it shouldn't slip. Then I saw this picture frame just laying there, which when flipped around turned out to be almost of perfect width for my tablet. I then found a small box which when turned around fitted inside and gave a good angle. So for now, until even better ideas arises, this my current stand. But please submit other suggestions as I'd would like to see other ideas (and don't want to accept my own answer :-)) 
Makeshift stand for large tablet
If you have a decently large log and a camping hatchet, you could notch the log on the side, then split it so you have a ledge to rest the tablet on and a back to support it.
How to put a mattress cover back on?
There are two tricks which my family has been using when doing this.  Unfortunately it still requires some work. First of all you should stretch it directly after washing to regain some of the size it had before washing. Especially try stretching the width of the covers. Do avoid tumble dryers as they tend to shrink it even more. Secondly, when inserting the mattress into the cover bend it halfway along the longest side before sliding it in. Then it is a matter of aligning the corners with each other. This does usually demand a little patience, time and fumbling. If you find yourself way off, you might need to bend the mattress again a little too get leverage for moving the cover. Good luck (or rather "Lykke til")! 
How to avoid splash sounds in public toilets?
Avoiding bodily sounds isn't possible, unless you fancy whistling or humming, but putting toilet paper in first will stop the water noises.
Measuring alcohol in system
I would say short of buying something which can check your breath you would have to work it out manually.If you waited 6-8 hours after drinking a pint of ale or lager i would say it would be safe, but how quickly it leaves your system is different for everyone.The NHS published this below in regards to how long it takes to break down alcohol. You can read the full article here.On average, it takes about one hour for your body to break down one unit of alcohol. However, this can vary, depending on:  your weight  whether you're male or female  your age  how quickly or slowly your body turns food into energy (your metabolism)  how much food you have eaten  the type and strength of the alcohol  whether you're taking medication and, if so, what type  It can also take longer if your liver isn't working normallyAt Respect Yourself they roughly claimunder 8 units: number of units + 1 hour (2 pints lager = 6 units, so  7 hours) 8-11 units: number of units + 1.5 hours (3 large glasses of  wine = 9 units, so 10.5 hours) 12 units plus: number of units x 1.5  (5 pints lager/glasses wine = 15 units, so 22.5 hours)Remeber, though, nothing is certain and the person testing you won't care that you waited x hours if you still have it in your system.You can read more on units of alcohol here but heres an image from the page. You can work out the units manually following the information from the NHSUsing units is a simpler way of representing a drink's alcohol content – usually expressed by the standard measure ABV, which stands for alcohol by volume.  ABV is a measure of the amount of pure alcohol as a percentage of the total volume of liquid in a drink.  You can find the ABV on the labels of cans and bottles, sometimes written as "vol" or "alcohol volume" or you can ask bar staff about particular drinks.  For example, wine that says "12% ABV" or "alcohol volume 12%" means that 12% of the volume of that drink is pure alcohol.  You can work out how many units there are in any drink by multiplying the total volume of a drink (in ml) by its ABV (which is measured as a percentage) and dividing the result by 1,000.  Strength (ABV) x volume (ml) ÷ 1,000 = units.  For example, to work out the number of units in a pint (568ml) of strong lager (ABV 5.2%):  5.2 (%) x 568 (ml) ÷ 1,000 = 2.95 unitsIn my personal experience i have had 1 beer, been breathalysed with in an hour, and shown up as no alcohol in my system.
How to avoid splash sounds in public toilets?
I'm going to take this in two partsHow do I avoid farting noises?This might sound weird, but there is a way to do this. Farts come out when the pressure builds up, then releases all at once. So do something to release it while it builds up. For me, taking a piece of toilet paper and pressing somewhere near the hole allows me to silently pass gas while on the toilet. But be careful...How do I avoid splashing noises?As Terry suggested, you can put a couple pieces of toilet paper in first. This has the added benefit of reducing the jets of water that attack you from below. But there is another way that helps as well. If you don't center yourself directly over the deepest section of the bowl, there's less water to splash on. This means less noise.However, everyone still makes noises while on the toilet. Everyone knows this. Because of this, people are more forgiving about it. Additionally, you will always make some small sounds. But you are more likely to notice these than other people. When it comes down to it, just do your business and don't worry about making too much sound.
How to avoid splash sounds in public toilets?
Use the toilet itself to mute the sounds by flushing when you feel gass is about to release, noone will hear it if you time it right.You could also play music from your phone, or fake a call and just play music as your ringtone while you go, it will seem like someone called you, your not picking up, and covering up random sounds all in one shot
Discourage sand from sticking to body when at the beach
Bringing Filtered water from home is a easy water source to clean, non salty water. (Alternatively, you can use the melted ice from the cooler)This will benefit with a towel to wipe yourself down and keep your body cleaner after leaving the beach. Many times, after swimming, the salt will actually add the feeling of 'sandy, dry, rubbery' to your body. By wiping down with a dedicated towel and some fresh water, you will feel much better afterwards!
Putting lawn mower into car trunk
Either a lever or a pulley allow you to move something heavy with reduced effort.  My first thought would be to find a tree with a sturdy branch that you can sling a good quality rope over.  You can then use the pulley effect of the tree branch to lift the mower out of the trunk.
Discourage sand from sticking to body when at the beach
I guess there is not much that can be done for prevention. This is more about what to do to get off sand.I hate sand in the car when our family of 5 goes to the beach. What works for us is this:After you are done in the splashing in the wet sand and water, if there is time to play/chill on the drier sand areas for 10-15 mins (on a hot day), all we have to do is shake the dry sand off or dust it with a small towel just before entering the car.I always carry 2 washed milk gallons filled with tap water when we go to the beach. Just wash the sand off to your hearts content and you can keep your car spotless. (BTW, we also carry some empty trash bags to put on the seats to keep it dry if we are pretty wet.)
Putting lawn mower into car trunk
An engine hoist would probably work well, and some of the home use ones disassemble/fold for transport and storage. However they are fairly large so this does depend on the type of car and lawn mower you have. (SUV vs compact car? and push vs rider mower?)  This is only cost effective if you already have a hoist or can borrow one because they are similar in price to a lawn mower. Other thought, have you tried borrowing a lawn mower from one of her neighbors? Return it with a full gas tank if you do!
How do I stop cars from tailgating?
Using the above methods to remain safe. You can always use your wiper blades as a deterrent. Typically if someone is following very closely, it will spray onto their wind shield. Again, only use this method if you are alerting the driver, do not use this method to drive ANGER to the situation, just throw him off his feet for a minute so he realizes he is following closely. I do this all the time and people just move out of the way, no horns, no FU, just a quick pass and they are no longer tailgating me.
How to find my way without a compass?
The guide for lost people.You are moving (by foot, by car, by whatever) through the landscapeuntil, well, this area does not look right....where am I ? First and most important rule: Do not panic. Stay where you are and think. When did you lose the track ? What is the last location which you definitely can locate ?Second rule: There is no "direction sense". No, no even natives like Inuit or Aborigines have it. Once you are blind, you cannot locate directions. Make the following experiment: Start in the middle of a football field, close your eyes and try to move out of the field by walking straight, a seeing partner walks with you and tells you when you are out of it. Just try it. It does not work, you are not walking straight, it is even  likely that you cannot leave the field at all. Tricks like limping with the stronger leg do not work either, forget it.Third rule: Do not leave the trail. No shortcuts, no "I am sure it must be meters away".How do I find directions (north and south) ?I must admit that I find the idea of building an own compass not so hot. The problem is: Commercial compasses are calibrated against deviation (disturbances of the magnetic field), so your self-built compass could easily deceive you. Even good compasses can be deceived if you are in the vicinity of iron (iron ore). Another problem is that the compass has a magnetic declination, an angle between true north and magnetic north:The tips using indicators like moss on trees etc. are very uncertain indicators. Do not use them.Better is the sun and the stars: They cannot show the wrong direction. Find Polaris to find north and the Southern Cross to find south. If you have forgotten how both look: aim at a star at the horizon, it will normally move. The more it is goes exactly vertical up/down, the more it is near East or West, if it is going up, it is East, if it going down, it is West.The method of ByteCommander with the watch is a thumb rule. It works because we defined noon as the time when the sun is at its highest point and in this case the sun is always exactly in the south/north. Because we have DST and time zones be aware that the local sun time can have a considerable difference (one or even two hours with DST) from your watch time ! The sun is moving around in 24 hours while the clock moves two times in 24 hours, so we need to half the angle between 12 o' clock and the hour hand.North and South could be also found exactly with the sun if you have time.  You need at least know at which hemisphere you are currently, north or south. Stick a stick into the ground and draw a circle around it. Mark where the shadow crosses when it lengthens and when it shortens. The exact middlebetween those points and the origin of the stick marks south (northern hemisphere) or north (southern hemisphere) !The following tips assume that your GPS device is broken. It isquite seldom, but people unlearn navigation if they are toodependent on the device.I am in the wilderness, but I have a map.Stay where you are and look for outstanding points (mountain peaks,railroads, roads, rivers). If you have a compass and can measurethe direction, the better. You simply find out the direction forthe line of sight from your point for two outstanding points, theircrossing is your position. If you do not have a compass, mark thepositions of the points with something (needles would be ideal).Hold the map steady and sight out with one eye so that outstanding pointand map point are in a beeline. Mark the line of direction withoutmoving the map and move your eye so that the other point/map pointare in line. The crossing point is your current position.If possible, try to get as many points as possible. Maps could containerrors, sometimes even deliberately to expose if someone makes a copy.The map could be outdated. It could contain buildings which have beendemolished.So with a map you need to make an effort to get lost. You maywalk unnecessary ways, but getting lost is pretty hard.I do not have a map or there is limited visibility (sandstorm, fog, inside wood)If you have only limited vision, you are in trouble. If possible, it isbetter to stay where you are if it is likely that the condition willimprove in time. If you see that something is up (The sight worsens,a cloud is coming, it begins to rain or snow) try to locate yourselfif you are in unknown territority and prepare to rest.If you are in a blizzard, a whiteout or dense fog moving withoutorientation is asking for suicide. No joking.If that is not possible, you have some options if limitedvisibility is available.Strategy 1: Follow a trail. It does not matter if it is a river,a road, a railroad, a line of powerpoles, whatever. If it is made byhumans it will lead to humans. If you get to a crossing, choose thepath which is bigger or has the most visible activity. Follow thefootsteps. The "direction sense" of native people is simply theability to follow the own or other tracks back.A river is not made by humans, but humans need water, so towns andcities are located on rivers. Follow the river downstream (In caseyou are in a desert, follow upstream ! Rivers are likely to ooze away).Strategy 2: Restore sight. If you are on flat ground (not mountains !!) and you have a trail available (remember rule 3 ?), get higher. You not only increase your sighting distance, sometimes youare able to get out of the visibility limitation. Fog is most dense atthe ground. You can climb an outstanding tree to see out of the wood (careful). Moving higher on mountains is generally a bad idea, becauseyou are moving away from possible help.Strategy 3: Perk up your ears and eyes. Human activity is often noisy or visible. You have noise of machines, trains, road traffic. If you can locate noise or light, move to it (Faint lights is swamps are not such a great idea, see will-o'-the-wisp). Do not be surprised if they are absent when expected during fog or snow or in a wood, these circumstances can dampen noise strongly.The following tips are for use inside cities.Finding the city center (train station) in a big (European) city.Move along the road. If you have a crossing, switch to the bigger road. If it is indicated that you are moving away from the center (less noisy, sign), revert direction. I do not know if it works for rectangle grid cities like in the USA, but it will work for most European cities.I know where I am but I lost my partner or my group.Move to the last safe location where you were together (Incase you were visiting an area with a high crime rate).Make this the standard procedure for everyone so you can countthat everyone knows what to do.The tricky one: Two or more people want to meet urgently but areunable to communicate their meeting point or time.Meet at the train station (if it is missing, the most importantpoint in the city) at either noon or midnight at the main entrance.If the day is missing: Sunday. If the month is missing: February.If the city is not known: The capital. The strategy is simple: Usesomething which stands out as location or time.

Putting lawn mower into car trunk
Get a box or crate (something that's about 1x1 ft at least) which is made of wood or other sturdy material.Place the box next to the rear bumper of your car. Use the handle of the lawnmower to tilt the mower forward, so that the rear wheels are off the ground but front are still on the ground, and slide the box edge beneath the rear wheels.Stabilizing the box with your foot (best if the box is on its side and your foot is in the open side), pull back on the handle to lever the front wheels up higher, and swivel the mower on the box to get the front mower wheels over the lip of the trunk.Walk the front wheels of the mower into the trunk. Place the box in the car.Reverse the procedure when you get to your grammy's house.This method has you exerting a maximum of half the force required to lift the whole mower. Hopefully this is manageable for you.

Discourage sand from sticking to body when at the beach
First, you need to establish what particular problem you are trying to solve. Do you dislike the feel on sand on you while you're at the beach? Or is the issue more that you end up sandy on your way home? Do you get sand all over you, or just the soles of your feet? Here are my tips, pick and choose among them:bring a blanket, or better still a bamboo-slat mat. These enable you to sit on the beach without sitting in sand. A towel is generally a poor substitute since it gets damp and you need it for drying offpick your location carefully. Are a lot of people running by? Playing some throwing-and-catching game? Interacting with sand (eg children who like to throw it?) Especially on a windy day, this will mean sand on you. Choose a more out-of-the-way locationwhen you are wet, don't run and kick up a lot of sand. Walk slowly. This way you'll have sand on the bottom of your feet, but not everywhere. This may mean bringing your towel to the water's edge so that you can dry off sooner rather than laterbring some baby powder but do not try to use it to prevent sand. It is a way to remove sand just before you leave. Hold your breath if you're worried about your lungs. bring a small tub, just big enough for your feet. When you're ready to go, fill it (salt water is fine, no need to bring your own fresh water,) and dip each foot in one at a time. Dry your foot as soon as it's rinsed and put on a shoe. Dump the water out when every foot is rinsed, and bring the tub home again. look to see if your beach has a shower; many do. These are as effective on sand as they are on salt. You may still need to rinse your feet of sand gained as you walk back from the shower

Putting lawn mower into car trunk
Easiest (and quickest) way (Grammy's waiting) is to back up to a curb, then use a box, half the height of the trunk and a small, flat piece of wood (Ply, 2 ft. by 2 ft.).Simply back up to the curb, then place the box on the floor and use it like a large step. If needed, place the wood like a ramp, but with the top overlapping the top of the box. Tilt the mower back and push forward so the front wheels either go on top of the box, or the top of the plywood. Then, while pushing forward, see-saw the mower onto the top of the box. You can use the same process to get the mower up another level into the trunk. This process will take little effort.

In the past I've just folded a bit of paper --- enough to provide a bit of tension when the plug goes in.  Doesn't take much to wedge something on the non-contact side to keep it firmly implanted and is good in an emergency. Of course if you want a permanent fix, a new cable or terminal end as suggested above would be the way to go.

Putting lawn mower into car trunk
When moving a cement mixer recently I used a small trailer, and self built ramp. The ramp consisted of two lengths of wood, 2"x4" (48 mm x 198 mm) and 5 ft (150 cm) length. Here is an image of how you could make the ramp:The trick to using lenghts of wood for a ramp, is to make sure that they doesn't break nor slip. Proper dimensioned planks ensure no breaking, but do take care when using the ramp. And here are some ideas to reduce the risk of slipping:A: Make a lip at the end of the wooden planks which goes down into the trunkB: Let the end of the planks stop against the curb, if possibleC: In a pinch, you could temporarily take out two car mats, place one over the trunk edge to protect the trunk edge, and put another under the end of plank to increase the frictionWhen utilising the ramp, push the lawn mover unto the bottom part first and wiggle it a little to make sure the ramp is stable. Now simply push it into the car, possibly shifting grips to the lower end of the lawn mover handles when halfway up the ramp.Let it gently go down into the trunk on the front wheels, and fasten it securely. Remember to pick up the planks, and stick into truck before driving off. 
How to waken myself when sleepy without causing much distraction to other employees?
Wet your (clean) fingers and rub/splash some water in your eyes.  It doesn't last very long but it might help waken you up for a few minutes.Longer term, consider what you're eating for breakfast, lunch, and other snacks, and what exercise you're getting. 
I have a regular analog clock. I want the hands to glow. Stickers? Paint?
Phosphorescent paint can only store enough energy for a few hours. To last longer, a source of energy is needed. Years ago, before the dangers of radiation were realized, radium or other radioactive material (e.g. tritium in a sealed container) was used to power radioluminescent paint.A more practical design, today, would be to use a UV LED or small argon glow lamp (AR-2 or the "starter" for a fluorescent light) to excite he luminous paint. This would also give you control of the brightness by changing the series dropping resistors.
How to reduce Dust in an appartment - use sticky tape?
Keep the windows closed, don't own any animals, leave your shoes outside the front door, live alone, don't eat anywhere but at a table, get dressed and undressed outside the house. Most of that is not really possible, of course, but around 60% of the dust in a home comes through open windows. You might be interested in reading the link below, but essentially, dust is always with us, and the only real way to reduce or deal with it is to either buy an air filter machine or to make sure you dust regularly.http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1966870,00.html

How to tell if surface is level
I'll give you two options for making a level of your own. Both are based on the simple fact that water is level, and will keep being level even going through a hose.Level based on glass of waterThe most rudimentary level you can have is a single container of water, and just watch the level of the water. This can be a glass bowl, or as simple as a single glass. If you combine this with a straight piece of wood, you have a rudimentary level.This can give you an accuracy of centimeters or parts of an inch, if used carefully. And the combination of a 3' / 1m piece of wood and glass, can be used together to measure if different furniture are reasonably level. You could even use the water glass / glass bowl directly on the furniture to verify that it is reasonably level.Added: A variation of this, requiring a little balance act, is to use two glasses one at each end of the plank. And then you can visually align this to get a sense on how unlevel it is.Level based on bottles and a hoseA much better level requires a little more equipment: two clear bottles, a hose and some tape to join it all together. The base setup is like in the image below:To make this you cut off the bottom of the two bottles, and join them to the hose using tape. Fill up from one end until you have water appearing in both of the bottles.This arrangement will have the water stabilising at the same level. If you have a few friends helping you, you can measure distance from the water level to your floor and decide what is level.Another option using this level is to use it close to the wall, and mark on the wall (i.e. using tape which can be removed afterwards) where it is level, and then measure out the floor at different points.Or you could use a tripod and fasten one bottle, measure the distance down to the floor, and then move the other bottle around and measure the difference of distance to the floor on different locations.Added: Extended usage exampleFirst of as Zaaikort indicates, you can also use a (semi-)transparent hose without the bottles as the level. In my experience though, it is a little easier with the bottles.One way to 'calibrate' the system is that you attach one bottle (or that hose end) to a chair (or stick) and make a mark on the bottle at the water level. Hold the other bottle next to it and make the mark at the other bottle as well. Make a note of the length down to the floor from the water level.When you now move the loose bottle around in the room, you can measure the distance from the water level and down to the floor. If it is not the same as the original distance (from the chair/stick) to the floor, you are not level and you can subtract the two values to see how much it is off. 
How to reduce Dust in an appartment - use sticky tape?
The sticky tape idea might work with a little more surface area on the sticky part and then add some sort of air moving device such as fans to move the air in your room or circulate the air in you're room by the sticky surface that way you would be running more air that contains dust by the surface that would collect it. Strangely enough I've heard that a very large percentage of our household dust comes from the dead skin exfoliating from our own bodies therefore it would make sense that if you moisturize your skin more often you might prevent that problem from happening so badly. Keep me posted on what worked and what did not work. I must add that any of those methods would pale by comparison to an air filtration system designed for this sort of thing of course.
How to reduce Dust in an appartment - use sticky tape?
Where is your dust coming from? If it is coming from open windows, or outside, you might be out of luck. But if it is coming from normal household sources, then your best way to remove dust might just be the vacuum and the wash machine. Most dust in your home's air will come from carpets, couches, blankets, clothing etc. You can see this in your dryer "lint" trap. So, regularly vacuuming and cleaning carpets and couches likely have the biggest impact on dust in the air. Regularly cleaning blankets, sheets, couch covers, rugs, etc. will also help a lot.As for cleaning the dust from the air, you are seeing the results I would expect from sticky paper and extra humidity. Those things may get some small amount of dust, but they won't get enough to notice. Hepa filters, or electrostatic air cleaners may help, but you don't want to use them, and I don't blame you. They are expensive to run. I do believe that a vacuum would probably reduce air dust more than an air filter anyway.
How to tell if surface is level
Marbles are just one option. You can roll a basketball, soccer ball, racquetball, one of those 50-cent bouncy balls kids get from a vending machine, or any other ball. I recommend giving it a tap to start it rolling, and see which way it heads.You can also use anything cylindrical that can roll. In elementary school I would roll a pencil one direction on my desk, and it would roll back the other way, so I knew it wasn't level. You can do that with a drinking glass that's shaped like a cylinder, rolling it different directions to find out if it stops and rolls back the other way. For example, roll it forward, then retrieve it. Staying in the same spot, turn a little to your right and roll the glass forward again. Repeat this until you've made a complete circle. If it rolls back to you at some point(s), it means the direction you're rolling it is higher than the spot you're rolling it from.
How to store bananas and keep fruit flies away?
I know this question is pretty old, but we used to have a ton of fruit flies in our house, and this year we had NONE. Our fruit of choice is peaches, and we usually buy too many to put in the fridge. What I did is fill my sink with cold water, add 1/4 cup of white, distilled vinegar and soak the peaches for 5 min. Then you just put them on a towel on the counter, and no fruit flies. Very easy.
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
My girlfriend left our sliding glass door open last week and we got so many flies in our bedroom it was crazy. I just took a bowl, put warm water and a table spoon of molasses and a squirt of dish soap in it. The next morning I had caught almost every fly. No work at all on my part. One note, you can use honey instead of molasses, but with the molasses the liquid is black, and you can't see all of the dead flies until you pour them out.For those of you that are curious, the sugar attracts the flies to the water, and from what I understand the dish soap makes it so the flies can't land on the surface of the water, then fly away. They "fall in" and drown. (poor little guys).

Remove super glue stain from windshield
You'll need some acetone (or your girlfriend/wife's liquid nail polish remover). Apply liberally, and then you just have to work at it to get it off and that's the part that might be difficult if you're trying not to scratch the glass. I'd try with a fingernail I think, given that's the least likely to cause scratching. Link below gives specific instructions, follow the ones listed under tables, floors, counters etc.http://www.supergluecorp.com/?q=removingsuperglue.html

Adding a belt hole without a leather punch
Use a power drill with a small drill bit the size of the hole you want.  Put a piece of scrap wood under the belt first. After the drill bit penetrates the belt, move the drill up and down to clear out the chaff from the edges of the hole.(if you don't own a drill, you could go to your local home depot - they often have test drills...be discrete....or...somewhere near you a neighbor probably has one)
Adding a belt hole without a leather punch
Careful usage of a sharp pointed knife can easily cut you another hole in your leather belt. Mark out where you want the new hole, and put the knife at the marker and rotate gently. Soon you'll have your extra hole. In fact most thingies with a sharp point can be used if you are in a real pinch. I.e. one end of scissors, kitchen knives, screw drivers, or even a key if you are a little persistent! Of course the sharper the better... 
How to correct misaligned sunglasses temples?
If they're metal you can just bend them. I've been wearing glasses and cheap sunglasses for about 30 years and never broken a pair doing this. Just make sure you hold the part you're bending separate from the part holding the lenses. I've never had a lens pop out but you want to be careful anyway.Next time try them on and bend them in the store. Or ask an employee to do it. If you go into a glasses store that's what they'll do anyway.

A razor blade at a low angle should work. I use the kind in the link below to change my windshield stickers (along with Goo Gone). They apply the same principle for fixing chips in a windshield (filling it in with an adhesive then scraping it off).
How would I filter rainwater to substitute having to buy distilled water?
Distilled water is can be made.  These instructions use common items so that you can envision this easier, not because you need those specific items.Put a coffee cup in the center of a cooking pot.Pour rain water into the pot, being careful not to get any in the cup.Cover the pot with clear plastic wrap ( it doesn't have to be super tight )Seal the wrap to the pot with a rubber band, you don't want any of the air escaping.Place a small rock in the middle of the wrap.  It should weigh the wrap down, and the lowest point of the wrap should be directly above the cup.Place the pot on a radiator.WaitThe water is going to evaporate, leaving behind any debris in the pot.  The water vapor will condense on the plastic wrap.  As this distilled water collects, the slope of the wrap will cause it to flow to the center.  Drops of water will form and eventually weigh do much as to fall off the wrap and into your cup.It will take a long time, a couple of ounces a day, maybe.  The idea is there, collect condensed water.  A pressure cooker would probably work great for heating water.  Attach a hose to the sream release and put a cup at the other end of the hose.  You just have to be sure about your rate of condensation.There is laboratory equipment made specifically for doing this type of thing.
Bike anti-theft measures
When I studied at the university some years ago (read: a lot of years ago), there were occasionally raids of bikes being stolen. It soon turned out to be two different kind of thieves:Professionals stealing quality bikesAmateurs needing a bike to get downtownThe first kind of thieves are not easy to stop from stealing your bike, whilst the other group is stopped by almost any kind of locks. But the first kind of thieves are able to cut through most kind of locks, even though it is locked firmly to any object.Of course if the bike only has a simple lock, not locked to anything, it eases the job for the thieves, but my point is that if the professional thieves really want it, they are going to get it.Preventing theftIn my experience the best option to prevent theft is to have a somewhat decent lock, lock the bike to some object, and have an ordinary bike of medium quality. These measures have kept my bike from being stolen.If you have an expensive bike, I would suggest never to leave it outside. When not using it, keep it inside (in garage or basement or similar), whilst still using a proper lock.Another option if you really have to lock it outdoors, is to have it locked in a place where everyone can see it (maybe even with surveillance cameras). This will hinder the possiblity for thieves to use a lot of time or heavier tools when stealing your bike.Lastly, the more expensive your bike is, the more you need to properly insure it, and make sure you know what demands the insurance company has related to locking your bike. Albeit I do believe your current locking scheme should be well enough for most insurance companies.
How to heat your room efficiently?
You basically has three options: heating, reducing area to be heated, and better insulation. Outside of this, there are no lifehacks ever going to save you, so let us tackle each one.HeatingThe most common heat sources are wood, gas and electricity. Electricity is by far the most efficient way in terms of heat produced. To reduce electricity usage, do use a heater directly instead of indirect heat through a refrigerator, lights, or other electrical equipment. They might have other benefits, but the heat value will be reduced as compared to a proper heater.Gas can be a good alternative, but requires enough ventialation not to be a safety hazard. However there does exist good gas ovens, which are allowed for indoor use, and if you have the money you can invest in dedicated gas ovens for indoor use.Wood is also a good alternative, and can be very useful and cheap if you have a good supply. This does however require a working fireplace, which the OP in this case says is not available.Reduce area to be heatedIf you have limited heating capabilities, it is always an option to reduce the are which needs to be heated. In one apartment I rented, I chose to close off two rooms in the winter, to reduce the electricity needed for heating. Either close off rooms for the cold seasons, or accept that some of the rooms are going to be colder. You can also try to divide existing rooms using either light walls, or blankets in a pinch, which will help a little.A variant of reducing area to be heated, is to allow the room to be colder, but use more and better clothes. This allows for you not to freeze, whilst the overall temperature in the room is lower. This can also be accomplished by using blankets when seated, or possibly a mattres heater when in bed.Better insulationYour best option is usually to get better insulation. Insulate walls, roof, floor and windows. Try to locate the coldest surface, and start there when insulating.Note that adding blankets/rugs can help insulate both walls and floors. If you have really old windows, it can help with thicker curtains or if really cold by inserting extra windows or even insulation boards.On a lighter note: A person usually generates around 100 W of heat, so inviting a lot of friends over will increase the temperature quite fast!
Bike anti-theft measures
It sounds like you didn't actually lock the bike to anything. This is not very secure at all a thief could just walk the bike away, lifting it up a little so that they were carrying it but it would still be subtle and passerby's wouldn't notice anything. Alternatively they could just load the bike into their car, again passerby's wouldn't notice anything.To secure your bike you need a decent lock and it must be secured to something such as a tree or light pole. That way the thief must deal with the lock before being able to take the bike. However this is very easily done with bolt cutters or even an angle grinder. This is why I've mentioned passerby's in the previous paragraph. It is one of the best ways to secure your bike. If you put your bike in a place where there will always be someone looking it's far less likely that someone will use bolt cutters on your lock, because of the public awareness of their actions. SummarySo secure your bike with a lock to an immovable object in a public place and you should be fine. The immovable object means they must deal with the lock before taking the bike and the public awareness means they cannot do so because they will surely be caught.
I have a regular analog clock. I want the hands to glow. Stickers? Paint?
Since it is a wall clock, you could also consider adding active lights to it. If you add a few leds or a small led strip you'll surely have no problem seeing the time. You could either opt for illuminating the background adding lights to the rim of the clock, or the faces as well if adding lights slightly in front of the clock. The really cool version would however be to replace the back with something semi-transparent, and put the lights behind the new back. Thusly making it backlit. 
In which pant-pocket should I keep wallet, handkerchief and phone?
You should keep Mobile and Handkerchief in the same pocket (handkerchief above the mobile) this will protect your mobile from external shock. If handkerchief is wet then also it should not damage the mobile because external body of mobiles are water resistant to some extent. For extra safety you can put a cover on your mobile phone.In other pocket you can keep wallet, keys and pen and you can put the comb in the rear pocket.
How to shred papers/letters without using a shredder machine
Use a 5 gallon bucket half filled with water; add enough paper to absorb most of the water and let sit for 24 hours; attach a paint mixing drill attachment to your power drill and power stir the saturated documents; drain mulch onto plastic garbage bag in corner of your back yard and let dry; discard in your trash.
Bike anti-theft measures
It sounds like your bike was locked into something solidly fixed into the ground to me. Unfortunately, the only answer is to buy a much less desirable bike, but you'd still need to lock it securely so that anyone who just fancies a bike ride home instead of walking won't be able to just take it easily. And make sure its covered on your Home Insurance...
In which pant-pocket should I keep wallet, handkerchief and phone?
You could keep your handkerchief in one of your rear pockets, as it wouldn't be a problem to sit on it or getting it pickpocketed.Front pockets are often like V shaped : you can put your keys in the bottom of the V of one of the pockets, depending of your handedness or preference, then you can keep your mobile above the keys, protected in a cover.In the other front pocket, you could keep your wallet, and slip the pen along it in the pocket.It is the configuration I am actually using, the only problem you could face is a big wallet making an unsightly lump on the front of your trousers.
Sweat and touch screen issues
I use plastic sandwich bags for everything (storing cables & cords so they don't get tangled, for example), and if you place your phone in a bag in your pocket it will not get any moisture on it. You don't need to seal the bag; that would just make it harder to take the phone out and wouldn't give much benefit.I imagine the bag might even stick to the inside of your pocket a little bit, which would make it a pretty excellent "pocket-liner".  It might stay in your pocket when you take your phone out, and be easy to put your phone back into. No one would even notice you had it in there. (Maybe. I haven't tried it myself.)Plastic bags are very inexpensive in the grocery stores in my area, and probably in yours too. If you're really lucky, the site that you're at might even have some in its lunchroom.  (My office does.)
Sweat and touch screen issues
You could try a self sealing waterproof bag. These are often issued to soldiers to keep important papers/items clean and dry while on operations.The link provided is for an Australian website, but you should be able to find these or similar at an army surplus/disposals type store.
How to shred papers/letters without using a shredder machine
This is how I do it,Tub – A lot of pages quickly:Fill a plastic tub with water, soap, salt, and a little bit of sand or ice and bleach. Or if you do not have this just water and soap. Mix it around for about 5 minutes then poor it away. The tiny pieces of paper should clump up so you can scoop them out and throw it away. Fire – Unlimited number of pages in seconds:Light a fire, put it in.Bleach – depends:Soak it in a pan of bleach, take it out. Blender – A few pages in seconds:Soak the paper in water, then put it in a blender with a red food coloring and ice. 
Adding a belt hole without a leather punch
I used to use a heated nail. Simply, hold it with pliers, and heat its tip up for a minute or so on the stove fire. Keep your belt stretched firmly (you can hold one side of the belt under you foot, and the other side with one of your hand, while the other hand is holding the pliers) and point the nail to the spot you want to make a hole, and push into the belt. It makes a small regular hole very easily.I see many sources on the web mention the nail with a hammer. No need for a hammer, heated nail held firmly with pliers, can make the hole you want.
I have a regular analog clock. I want the hands to glow. Stickers? Paint?
for quick and dirty, there are glow in the dark dots. these are paper stickers and trimmable.
Rehydrate gel air-freshener
This only happens to solvent based air fresheners, when the solvent evaporates. You want to add more solvent. If they used water as the solvent you are in luck as you can just add water, but This is rare as aromatic oils are more common. Unfortunately, the oils I know would work from a solvent perspective stink (MEK, acetone, etc.) and the oils that smell good smell strong but are of unknown effectiveness as solvent (olive, sesame, etc.) If you are open to experimenting candidate oils to try would be canola, baby oil, and light mineral oil. will probably work better warm.
How to shred papers/letters without using a shredder machine
You can fold the paper in various ways and then cut it with a scissor. With one cut many pieces will be formed.Another way--If you have any printer then you can insert those pages into it and print a page full of alphabets, symbols, etc. This will overwrite your important letters. Now even if it gives large strips, one can hardly understand whats written over there.
How to heat your room efficiently?
CAUTION: Some of the suggested answers seem dangerous. Open flames indoors are a terrible idea because of fire hazard and potential of carbon monoxide poisoning and oxygen depletion. The hackability here is significantly limited by the basic physics. The total energy required to warm up a room is dependent on two things and two things only:Temperature difference between the room and the adjacent "cold" areasIsolation between the room and adjacent cold areasWhere the energy comes from and how it's getting introduced in the room makes little difference. A 300W open fridge or a 300W light bulb or a gas burner with 300W effective power do exactly the same thing. If you want to more efficient, you can reduce the area that needs heating, lower the temperature in the heated area and/or improve insulation. Other than that it comes down to which heating method provides the most energy per dollar. You can look at energy content here http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/energy-content-d_868.html. For example the energy content of one kilowatt hour of electricity is roughly equivalent to 3 cubic feet of natural gas. You can use this to compare prices.There are a few second order effects, like the exact heat distribution in the room or the losses involved in the heat generation but they typically don't make much of a difference.

How to Not Smell Like Feces without Bathing?
You need to bath. If you are really stinking bad then squeeze some lemon in the bathtub and add a few drops of rose water. It will make you smell nice. Also you can add liquid dettol(antiseptic liquid) to be hygienic. If you don't want to bath then shave the hairs on your chest and underarm areas. Hairs in these areas absorbs the sweat and smells really bad.
How to reduce Dust in an appartment - use sticky tape?
It's not clear if you want to avoid dust as a one time thing or on a regular basis. My room has only one window for light and air and so also gets a lot of dust from that window. I use one of those microfiber mops. In India, we have a popular brand called ScotchBrite that makes these, even though the brand advocates using it with water, from personal experience, just swabbing dry works well. Catches all the dust on the floor, no need to bend or stoop, the head swivels nicely so i can run it across ridges of the walls as well.For wet swabbing, I use a Indian brand mop called Eureka Forbes's Glide, it comes with a bottle attachment where you can fill in any combination of floor cleaners and then spray to mop the floor.update: I also recently discovered electric sweepers! For India there is Xiolife cordless sweeper available on Amazon. For US, I believe you can look at the "Bissell" brand.
Bike anti-theft measures
Well, I live in NYC. Here are some tips that I use and/or have seen around town:Don't leave it in a busy area, no matter how good your locks are I use Pinhead locks for the wheels and seat I use a German made U-lock (ABUS) Take off the wheel or seat and carry it with you Make your bike uglier, so it's less attractive Be careful to not leave your bikelocked to scaffolding Keep your bike indoors as much as possible (Istore mine in my apt) Don't let your bike be the only bike aroundRegister your bike with the policeSome people are determined, though. Sorry about your bike! For your next bike, don't use a chain lock, upgrade your U-lock, get your bike registered with the police, use common sense in general. Good luck!Edit: made a mistake with the bullets; make your bike uglier is it's own tip
System for organizing worn but still clean clothes
Big problem, that, and I have the same trouble. I never return to the closet anything I've worn, but it just means it ends up on a chair in the bedroom, creating an increasing pile of clothes over time which have only been worn for a short period - then they get all creased and fall on the floor and I just wash them anyway. Lately I've taken to hanging them up on newly-purchased-for-this-purpose hangers on the outside of the wardrobe (or closet, depending where you are), and attempting to re-wear them within a short time and clearing them that way. Its not ideal, but I haven't enough room (and I don't think you have either) to find another solution, and worn clothes should be 'aired' rather than just enclosed in something immediately.If you have room, then keeping a space in the closet to hang up part worn clothes would be ideal, perhaps separated from the rest with a hanger with one of those plastic bags from the dry cleaners between the two areas.
How to Not Smell Like Feces without Bathing?
Not to sound alarming, and I'm not trying to read into this too much, but you should know that it is considered a symptom of depression, or some other psychosis, when someone stops taking care of their own personal hygiene. Feeling "lazy" about washing your body, or that this task is "too much work", are signs of depression. It's not considered normal for someone to neglect their personal hygiene. You may not feel that you are depressed, but are there other hygiene or personal care tasks that are also getting neglected? It's a slippery slope. Even asking here, about how to accommodate this behavior, shows some acknowledgement that this is not normal. Cologne and deodorant don't count. I'm not a doctor, so don't consider this as a diagnosis. However, this is not normal behavior and I hope you get motivated to either change your behavior or look into discussing how you feel about this with someone who is qualified to give you their professional opinion.Web search on 'depression not bathing'.
System for organizing worn but still clean clothes
A strategy I have used is to place a distinctive object on the closet bar (such as a hanger for a special item, or a cardboard sheet with a hole cut in it (and a slot to get it on) so it hangs perpendicular on the bar). All clean clothes go on one side, and all dirty clothes go on the other. As long as you don't get your left and right mixed up, this will work perfectly — and even then, the dirty side will likely be recognizable as it contains clothes you remember wearing recently.Side note: it may be a bad idea to hang worn clothes in the closet, because the moisture and skin flakes may attract pests which will eat the clean clothes as well as the dirty ones. (I forget what the exact critters involved are.)Another thing I used to use for stashing some clothes is the wire mesh cube storage that's commonly sold to college students. One advantage is that they allow for plenty of ventilation. In addition to putting things on the shelves, you can drape clothes over the edge or hook them on the corner fittings, especially if you assemble the system so that the topmost cubes are open at the top rather than the side.Another idea I've had, but haven't gotten around to implementing, is to make some sort of marker that I can hang around the hook of a hanger which means “this item has been worn once”, so counting how many markers a hanger has tells you its condition (and none means it's clean). Even if I did this, I wouldn't want to let my clean and dirty clothing be mixed up since it might transfer odors and so on.
System for organizing worn but still clean clothes
You should be able to split your closet into sections. On the left side, Clean, never worn shirts/pants. On the right side, place the clothes you have only worn one time. this will allow you to visit your closet, and see all of your options available to you, and you know whether or not it has been worn once, or completely clean. This system is very clean, and very organized. No need for labels or guessing.
How to shred papers/letters without using a shredder machine
This may be of limited value depending on where your location and transportation situation, but what I've done is searched online for things like "shredding event [my city]" or "free shredding [my city]" and looked for upcoming free shredding events. I've done this several times; they've usually been on Saturdays, sponsored by banks or cities, and used giant industrial shredders.  It's been more cost- and time-effective than buying a shredder for my small shredding needs.
How can I keep my cat off my keyboard?
Animals need boundaries. The only way to prevent that from happening is to set boundaries with him. If he steps on the keyboard, remove him from the desk and place him on the ground. You will need to REPEATEDLY do this EVERY TIME. He will very quickly learn that as soon as he steps on the keyboard, that means he is going to be removed from the desk. It may take him 30 minutes of continually doing this, it may take 2 hours of continually doing this, but as long as you are consistent, he will learn quickly.This method I am providing you is a common way to train both dogs and cats. You need to stay firm with your boundaries and do not alter them.For instance, if one day you feel that him stepping on your keyboard does not bother you, and you do not take action and place him on the ground, you will now need to RETEACH him the whole process and spend another 2 hours doing so.I hope this helps and good luck!
How can I keep my cat off my keyboard?
Place a box near your keyboard that is the right size for the cat to sit in. If possible, place it on something warm.Cats like two things: warmth and security. It likes being on your keyboard because it's warm. Provided a warm and secure place to sit and it'll prefer that.
How can I keep my cat off my keyboard?
Providing something that the cat prefers is the only way to solve this problem.  My experience is that cats need a boundary that fits them.  For example,  my cat will sit on my keyboard and stare me down in a challenge if I try to remove her.   But if I provide a nice warm box near the computer,  she is perfectly happy to have that instead.  With all cats,  your mileage may vary.
How to get a stronger radio signal?
Try capacitive coupling to the cell phone: attach a wire about 2 m (6 ft) long to a piece of aluminum foil; rest the plastic case of the phone (avoid any metallic part touching the foil, for safety) on the foil and move the wire around for best reception.There's no guarantee this will get more stations, but it's an easy experiment. Let us know how it works for you.
Humanely persuade neighbourhood cat not to defecate in my garden
I once read that cats will walk around used coffee grounds. Just place some piles in the places where the cat goes and it should avoid those areas. Ofcourse you will need a lot of coffee to protect your entire garden, but it might be a start to protect some areas.PS: I'm told this will also keep away snails.

How can I keep my cat off my keyboard?
This happens because my cat likes to sit on my keyboard. Is there any way to prevent this from happening? I enjoy my cat's company while working, so would rather not shut him out.Since this is Lifehacks, I figure it's fine to offer an alternative solution:Install a cat typing detector on your computer.This is software that detects when the keyboard is being operated in a non-humanlike manner (presumably, e.g. with clusters of nearby keys being pressed simultaneously), and locks the keyboard when that happens.                                                                    (Source)Some can also be configured to emit a loud noise when they detect a cat on the keyboard, hopefully annoying the cat enough to keep them away even if you're not around to move them off.  Or you can disable that feature and just let your cat lounge on your keyboard as much as she likes, secure in the knowledge that it won't harm your computer (except maybe by getting the fans full of cat hair, but that'll happen anyway).The one I've personally used, and can testify to the effectiveness of, is PawSense, which the screenshot above comes from.  Alas, it's Windows-only, and somewhat pricey too, but my parents own a license and have been quite satisfied with it.  And it's even won an IgNobel prize! ;-)Apparently, there's a program called CatNip that does the same for OS X.  Alas, I'm not yet aware of equivalent software for Linux.  Apparently, in this particular respect, open source is (so far) inferior! ;-)Ps. See also this related question on Super User.
natural way to reverse tooth decay fast
Your belief that teeth can 'regrow' isn't exactly right, but that said, the old and firmly established idea that cavities cannot heal themselves or be reversed has been proved to be erroneous, with the caveat that, if the decay is severe and the tooth is painful, particularly if the root is affected, its a trip to the dentist before you get an abcess. In those circumstances, its unfortunately already too late for your tooth to heal itself.However, research in the last few years does indicate that small cavities in teeth do heal themselves, given the right conditions, and in the UK and parts of Europe for the last decade or so, small cavities are left by the dentist to see if they heal themselves with improved dental hygiene. I know that they can do, having had personal experience of this with a younger relative.A change in diet might be necessary depending on what you currently consume, and there's some interesting information in the link below, garnered from various scientific sources, including The Lancet (a well respected British medical publication). Having read it myself, I'm off to do further research, given I eat whole oats daily, and am also currently looking at the role of proteolytic enzymes regarding tooth decay and other health issues, another area of interest. I've not provided a link to the enzyme situation because I'm still researching it.http://draxe.com/naturally-reverse-cavities-heal-tooth-decay/Whilst this answer does answer your question, any solutions are not 'fast' - and whether any of this actually counts as a Hack, I can't quite decide.UPDATE:I have found the British Medical Journal report, also published in the Dental Association's Journal in the UK, and the link is below - however, if you want to access it properly, you have to pay, and I ain't that desperate to prove this information accurate! http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2520490/
How can I keep my cat off my keyboard?
If its just a keyboard and not a laptop, find any box the right shape and size which will leave a gap between the bottom (once inverted) and the keyboard, keep it in the room. When you leave the room, invert it over the keyboard - you might find the cat sitting on the box when you return, but at least he won't be typing for you while you're absent.In my experience, whilst a cat might choose to occupy a box you've provided for them to sit in, with a comfy cushion or not, they don't continue to occupy it, it's just a five minute wonder, so blocking access to the keyboard is better.

Car windscreen has lots of tiny scratches. How to remove them?
I did not believe that this method worked until I tried it myself.  I can personally vouch for how effective it is.Polish the dry windscreen with dry 0000 (Extra Fine) wire wool.  It is vital that you use 0000 extra fine grade or you will add to the scratches.  Once the windscreen is totally and completely clean, sparingly apply a wetting agent (such as RainX).
How can I keep my cat off my keyboard?
Does your cat have spot-on flea/worm prevention (or other unpleasant medication, ideally given more frequently)? If so, keep it in a box next to the keyboard, for application when scheduled.  You may reach into the box a make the medication make its noise when the cat jumps onto the desk and it will soon leave the room. (I have to get the flea prevention out of the foil when the cat is out of the house, otherwise she recognises the noise and is out through the catflap in an instant).

I remember this from /r/funny a while back - a decoy keyboard!Kitty Fooled!
How can I keep my cat off my keyboard?
I agree that they do it for warmth.  I also got a box (although I took it one step further and placed a heating pad under the blanket inside the box at first... the room really was very chilly.)But they also love attention.  Complete, undivided attention.  So when O'Toole would stretch out over my keyboard, he knew that(a)  I would have to stop whatever I was doing, and(b)  That he would receive attention (good or bad, he didn't care; he's a cat.)I pretty much did the "pick him up and place him elsewhere" routine and was 100% consistent with it.  However, when I put him in his box, I'd talk to him and pet him a while so he'd be complacent and not jump right back on the keyboard.He found that it was more rewarding to just go to his box (and I made sure that when he did, I'd fuss over him in a good way) than to get on the keyboard. Of course, he enjoyed that more than me going, "Oh my God O'Toole, really?" and unceremoniously putting him on the floor.

How can I keep my cat off my keyboard?
Over the years my desk cats seem to want two things: a "frame" and attention – they seem to like warmth too, but since the last of my CRTs is long gone the heat from my laptop doesn't seem to be as big a draw as the other too. My current cat likes to lie between my arms, so he doesn't do much typing…But, I've had luck with other cats with putting a placemat just beyond my keyboard. The cat has a frame and can feel my attention (or so I think). If I put the placemat off to the side the cat doesn't seem to like it as much.
I wanna make my hair straight permanently?
A permanent relaxer will chemically straighten your hair. It can be achieved with at-home kits as well as a salon visit. The one caveat is that as you hair grows, the new hair will be untreated. This means that to keep your hair "relaxed" or straight you will need to retreat it about every eight weeks.

ExOfficio makes clothes specifically designed to keep insects away.  
Car windscreen has lots of tiny scratches. How to remove them?
The main approach is to use a series of very fine abrasives and glass polishes. The problem with this strategy is that it is very time consuming to polish glass and takes a considerable amount of skill. A non-professional will typically just end up with a worse result.I use a different strategy as follows:(1) clean the windshield(2) clay the windshield; it is absolutely essential all particles be completely removed(3) use a pad or paper towel that is very slightly humid and cake table salt onto it, then rub the windshield with it hardWhat this does is smooth the glass, not scratch it. Glass is actually amorphous; the salt basically pushes the glass and smoothes it out without scratching the glass. Salt is too soft and friable to scratch glass which is why this works. From a technical point of view, this is called "burnishing," not polishing.Once again you must thoroughly clay the windshield first; if you fail to do this you will scratch it up much worse.
How to quickly dry out a Camelbak?
Use 95% pure ethanol, sold in liquor stores as "rectified spirits". Just a small amount is all you need. Slosh it around the container and it will pick up every last speck of water and evaporate it, leaving the interior of the container bone dry.Caveats:(1) Do not use 70% alchohol, that will not work(2) Do not use "denatured" alcohol under any circumstances. It contains a solid chemical called denatonium which tastes terrible and which you do not want to be in your container.
How to quickly dry out a Camelbak?
I dried mine out all I could with kitchen roll then filled it with some more and left it opening-down in the airing cupboard for a day or so. Maybe not the best way but it seemed to work for me
How can I keep my cat off my keyboard?
Fashion a box over the keyboard in the manner of the kind used when learning how to touch type.  That is, you reach the keys through the open side but your view is blocked.Then, either make the box sturdy enough so the can can sit atop that, joining you while you work without interfering; orPut sticky-side-up painter's tape on top to disuade the cat from parking there.
How to quickly dry out a Camelbak?
You can insert the tubing inside the container such that opposing walls don't touch and leave it open for a day or two till all water is evaporated.
How to take pictures in the rain with a digital camera, so that lens doesn't get damaged?
You can easily create a waterproof case for your Camera (Digital Camera, Phone Camera, everything except for DSLR witch you did not mention you had so I am making an assumption.Based on my assumption, One common method of waterproof DIY is to use a food preserver (Vacuum's the air out then seals it.) This method will work with your camera, phone, anything you need. The beauty of it is, if your use this method for your phone, the audio still can be heard, the touch screen still works, etc... so its 100% adaptable and usable.If you are using DSLR, you will need to consider a complete enclosure since the lens connects to the base unit. Here is the Vacuum I am referencing
How to clean out a peanut butter jar for recycling?
Easiest and fastest way to clean out ANY jar for recycling...2-3 WET paper towels with dawn dish soap. Use your elbow grease and just wipe the jar, the paper towel will pick up enough left over food to make it recyclable.Recycling doesn't have to be a tedious job that requires 10 minutes of soaking. They just dont want people throwing in stuff that spoils and causing issues with he rest of the recyclables. Do a quick wipe and rinse, the thicker the paper towel the more it will pick up, quick fast and easy...
Does freezing tights make them more durable?
In the second method (and likely in the first), it's probably not the cold that's doing it, but the dampness -- it's well known that nylon strengthens when it absorbs water.  The waiting overnight (and probably, in the first method, the condensation from taking them out of the freezer) lets water get into the nylon fibers and strengthen them.
How to write in a straight line without lined paper?
Obtain a piece of ruled or graph paper and thicken the lines with a black permanent marker (preferably on both sides but make sure the two sides are aligned).Place this lined paper on a sheet of transparent plastic or glass supported by thick books or on a glass table.Orient a flash-light or table lamp so it shines up through the paper.Place the paper you are writing on on top and write!
Stiff Telescopic Arm
This remains on the 'unanswered' list so I'll answer it in order to change that.As Terry says. The answer is to spray a very small amount of WD40 down one edge.
Best Way To Sort Trading Cards
I agree with the previous poster that getting the cards into a computer is kind of a faff (I enjoy that British-ism).But you asked a sorting question - I am assuming the cards aren't in any particular order? It is worth thinking about sorting algorithms before you dive in -- the sort of inefficient sorts that are taught in intro Comp Sci are helpful. I did this recently with a similar number of cards and used a sort of bucket sort by year (I could know at a glance what year the cards were from). I would place them in a small number of buckets and then bucket sort the buckets until I hit where all the cards by year. Then manufacturer and I then stopped. It was an afternoon project and (admittedly) a kind of obvious solution, but I ended up with a decently sorted batch of cards that I packed and stored nicely to wait another few decades until I decide busting them open might be worthwhile.Hope this helps.
Humanely persuade neighbourhood cat not to defecate in my garden
Here's a method i've heard of, but have not yet used, as we haven't been so desperate.Mark your territory.Spread pee from an adult male around the perimeter of your property. Animals will smell it and won't dare to enter. However, people might smell it also... You'll have to refresh it every so often.
Best Way To Sort Trading Cards
Basically as I see it you have three options:Forget about it, and keep them sorted outside of the computerBuy/acquire a duplex card scanner with automatic document feederRig a camera with some sort of automated picture takingAlthough I do believe that the first option might be worth considering as this otherwise will be a time consuming event, I'll give some more details to the other two.Duplex card scanner with automatic document feederIf you want to scan that amount of cards, you need to make it somewhat automated, hence you need a scanner with automatic document feeder. In addition you don't want to load the stack twice to get both sides of the card, so you need a duplex scanner scanning both sides at the same time.Lastly you don't want the cards to be bent too much, I assume, so you need to make sure that paper path of the scanner is as straight as possible. This rules out ordinary copy/printer/scanner multi-taskers as they tend to send the paper around rolls both to get it through the apparatus, but also to do the dual side scanning.Therefore I would suggest looking/search for duplex card scanner with feeder or similar and see if you can't find something to suit your needs. And we don't do product recommendations on this site (Not, that I know a a particular product which does this well either).Note that even with a document feeder, you'll most likely only be able to pass it up towards a 100 cards at a time, so it'll still take plenty of time. But if the scanner is good enough, you might get OCR (Optical Character Recognisition) as well, which would enable you to search textually through your cards afterwards.Rig a camera (or two)Another option, even more time consuming, would be to rig a camera and lights so that you put a card at a fixed place and then take a snap of it, either using a timer or a foot switch or some other kind of remote triggering device. This is kind of like stop motion photographing, which can be used for this kind of endeavour as well. Advantage is that in this kind of setup you'll likely automate the transfer from the camera to the computer, and you'll have manually adjusted focus so it stays put, and you can automate any cropping of pictures as they all are in a fixed position.Downsides is that you'll have to flip cards to get the backside (unless you rig a dual camera version, and put the card on a glass plate), and you'll have to manually go through all 10 000 cards, and if not doing anything fancy on the computer you'll only have a picture (and not text). Although it is possible to do OCR afterwards with images.
How long is a piece of [shoe] string?
I don't know if this qualifies as a hack, but just do the math:You need to have two ends to tie together of a somewhat appropriate length, estimated at 4 times the distance between the eyelet columns, or find a given constant you are satisified withThe laces needs cross over at the bottom and top of the eyelets, that is twice for each pair of eyeletsIn other words, given 6 pairs of eyelets, and an approx distance between the left and right column of eyelets to be 5 cm (or 2 inches), you'll get a formula like the following:lace for tieing plus number of eyelets, multiplied with the distance between eyelet columnsFor 12 eyelet pairs with a distance of 5 cm (or 2 inches) this would give "2*4 + 12" multiplied with 5 cm (or 2 inches) giving 100 cm (or 40 inches)Another way of putting this is: Start of with 40 cm (or 16 inches) and add 10 cm (or 4 inches) for each pair of eyelets But, your safest bet is simply to pull out either the one lace which are still intact, or the two pieces of broken lace and simply measure the length.
How to make my bicycle run faster?
Pump up your tires! In my experience, even when in a hurry, the extra time spent on getting the tires up to maximum pressure usually pays off.
How to write in a straight line without lined paper?
I would suggest buying a colored A4(or whatever size you need) paper to use as guides instead of using a ruler like you tried. By making the colored paper perpendicular to your working paper you can use a replace guide/mask to the lower limit of your line. you can slowly move the colored paper down as you write more lines making sure your colored paper is perpendicular and you are moving down approximately the same amount each time you start a new line.
Adding a belt hole without a leather punch
A lot of shops will punch one for you.You could go to a shoe repair shop or a menswear shop and ask if they can punch the hole for you. 
Adding a belt hole without a leather punch
I generally use the pointed end of scissors for punching a hole into my belt.Once, it manages to pierce to the other end, start rotating it, while simultaneously drilling in; until the hole of desired size(or diameter) is punched in.If the scissors isn't sharp enough, then using the hack suggested by @Hawk
Adding a belt hole without a leather punch
For many years, I've used the awl point found on many multitools (vis. Leatherman) and multiblade pocket knives.  I just use pressure on the belt's metal tongue to make a mark, then take off the belt and drill through with the awl point by rotating back and forth.  Once it pierces through, a few additional rotation strokes will enlarge the hole enough for the tongue to push through readily, and you're good to go.
What is the best way to recondition a whiteboard?
Not sure about how to fix a damaged board, but when keeping up with maintenance, I would be careful about using products besides whiteboard cleaners such as household cleaners because they may void your warranty!

How can I keep my button/rivet fly jeans closed?
Put a couple of stitches in each buttonhole to make it a little smaller - check you're not making them too small so the button or stud won't go through, but you need to have them so its reasonably tough to push through the hole.

Another solution is to place a sheet of carbon paper on top of the paper you are writing on.Place a sheet of ruled or graph paper on top of the carbon paper and align them well.Push down hard on the pencil.Afterwards you can thicken the faint writing.Note: Makeshift carbon paper can be rather tediously manufactured by filling in one side of the graph paper with a pencil.

What is a good way to organise and identify keys on a keyring?
I have added notches to the side of the key head in the past. One of the advantages to using this method is that you can find the correct key in the dark.Start with this:Take a file to the edge of the key head. Move it back and forth to create a furrow.  End up with this:Add as many notches to the key as you require. If your key has a flat edge that isn't used by the pins to unlock the lock, you can also use that side.
What is a good way to organise and identify keys on a keyring?
Coloring the keys is a good way to go. For coloring I would suggest nail polish,  which is quite durable. Other spray paint might be tried as well, but nail polish is really accessible and easy to apply. If you want you could even mark keys with letters or numbers or symbols. But please take care not inviting thieves by writing house number or address on the keys. Make the markings subtle and the meaning known only  to you and those using the keys. 
What is a good way to organise and identify keys on a keyring?
I've often seen people solving this problem by using colored key caps.But if you are like me and want to avoid extra weight/volume, you can use dot stickers. Stick one on each side for faster lookup.
More efficient way to arrange a CD collection
I scanned all my CDs into lossless FLAC files on a file server, and stored the origianal discs in plain flat plastic envelopes that are archival quality for that purpose.Each track or album has metadata attached, and I used different directory structures for each genre as appropriate.  The computer can search based on any attribute, and I can make playlists and symbolic-link directories to organize how I want on dumb players that just show the directory structure.The entire original disc set (sans jewel cases) fits in a nice wood and leather chest. Another program called Readerware keeps an inventory I can search by any field: once I find the disc by any way of searching, I can see the actual disc name (say, an anthology collection) and a storage field can remind me where I put it; e.g. is it in the Christmas collection or the Chinese collection etc.I use Readerware for books too. If you don't scan but need frequent access to the hard media, that's what I do with books and DVDs. The storage field tells me which box it's stored in or which shelf it's kept on.Note that envelopes in a tray is much easier to insert things into that Jewel cases! I use DiscSox products.  For my 500+ DVDs I have pull-out trays with flat envelopes that are 1/5 the bulk of DVD boxes. Tall index cards for each letter of the alphabet, and inserting a new item is no big deal, unlike re-arranging hard jewel cases across shelves!
Faster ways of placing cans in the fridge?
I buy cans in a 24-pack box and spaced the shelves to fit that. The whole box goes in, period. The box dispenses from the front.
How long is a piece of [shoe] string?
Buy a 100-foot length of paracord and use that instead of laces. They are the ultimate shoelace, and might be the last you need without breaking again!Cut to length, and form the aglet by melting the plastic with a lighter and rolling it with a wet thumb-and-finger.I learned about paracord from a TV episode Going Deep with David Rees: How to tie your shoes, and it demonstrated how paracord is stronger and more durable than common shoelaces.  I found a short on YouTube from this eposide, too.
How can I (painlessly) add/remove keys to my key ring?
I agree these hard keyrings are incredibly annoying.Please try to not use your nail, you are too likely to break it.Here are the solutions that come to mind:Use a knife (not one with a cheap blade, you certainly don't want to break it). Though, it still requires some practice to get the right gesture. And you are guaranteed to damage the blade edge.Find a lighter keyring. Sorry no photo for now, but you can find "cheap" keyrings that are made of a much thinner wire. They perfectly do the job and are suuuuch a pleasure to manipulate.Or, you can always carry a staple remover.
Humanely persuade neighbourhood cat not to defecate in my garden
Liking cats I know that they like it safe and secure, donot like surprises and generally hate water.You need to wait until you see the cat coming into your garden. When it prepares itself to defecate, you take this:which you filled with ice-cold water and...surprise. The range of the soaker should make it possible that the cat is notprepared .Hit it one or two times and the cat won't bother to visit you everagain. You should be aware that you should not do that if youactually like the cat, it will not forgive you.
What is a good way to organise and identify keys on a keyring?
You could try to group them together in small clusters based on your daily activity, and even put them in a sequence based on step by step usage. Add a label rather than a color on each key, especially if you have a lot. If the keys keep adding, an idea would be to switch "technology" (badge-based access systems etc.).  
Cleaning a blood stain from a silk tie
Windex will take apart blood stains in clothes. Ammonia, the cleaning ingredient takes apart the fat molecules that make up the blood cell wall.Meat tenderizer also works but is quite expensive. A similar enzymatic cleaning agent is oxy clean. Like hydrogen peroxide it uses oxygen to clean with. Hydrogen peroxide is well known as a bleaching agent for organic matter, I.e. lightening human hair. Since silk is formed of a similar protein structure to human hair I would not recommend it as a cleaning agent for silk, especially if coloured.Perhaps your friend could mail the tie to a reputable cleaner? A tie is lightweight and easily shipped.The real solution is for your friend to prevent nosebleeds to begin with. Keeping hydrated is key.In desert countries water features are often designed into residences for exactly this reason, purposes of humidity and hydration. Indoor fountains can be even tabletop sized and still hydrate their vicinity. If there is no way to even introduce a personal fountain, perhaps there is a public swimming area. Perhaps your friend could swim more? And try that nasal saline sprays to keep his nose wetter? And take his vitamin c and e and k1&2 to help his epithelial cells to recover faster and with clotting??By the way, the dry winter cold here also can cause nosebleeds. There is a cream similar to polysporin that can be gotten in pharmacies here. 
What is a good way to organise and identify keys on a keyring?
I use order and memory.Start by removing any keys you don't need on your keyring. They're just adding to the bulk from the off.I order my keys by frequency of use and by direction where one way represents locks at the front of my house and the other way represents locks at the back of my house. The car key is the "root", the key next to this is "forwards". While this exact pattern might not work for you, I'm sure you could come up with something similar to suit. If you need a lot of keys, I'd consider two keyrings linked together with i.e. one for work and one for home, or one for inside and one for outside.
How to reduce creepy crawly insects in the house?
Try closing your windows after sunset. Most bugs are attracted to light, so they will enter en-mass when its brighter in your room than outside. Even if you only shut out certain types of insect this should help break the 'ecosystem' in your home and drive the rest out eventually too.

How to reduce creepy crawly insects in the house?
Spiders are not insects. They are beneficial so don't kill them.  If their prey is not present they won't be either, so spiders will take care of themselves.  I spray the baseboards once a year or so, and renew the spray at the doorway and pantry after the floor is mopped.  I use bait huts in the pantry and window sills.Since silverfish eat books and clothes, sweeping and washing won't take care of it. You need to have a professional treat the house to get rid of the infestation.

How to reduce creepy crawly insects in the house?
I can tell you that the chestnut thing absolutely does not work - I watched a spider clambering over one in the doorway last year. Its difficult to keep them out in old houses, they get in through small cracks everywhere, but it might be worth trying a spider repellent spray, something like No More Spiders, which you can buy over the internet. They're based on peppermint, so you could make your own by using peppermint oil mixed up in a sprayer with a bit of warm water. You spray around doorways and windows to discourage them, but best not used on fabrics like carpets. Trouble is, with old walls, their points of entry may not be restricted to doorways and windows...As for the silverfish, they're a problem associated usually with damp areas, unfortunately.
How to keep dust-free when digitizing photos
Since you used real glass, you can really clean it.  I used acetone to clean the scanner glass when it had fogged from outgassing of plastics inside the scanner.  So when you get something onnthe glass that doesn't wipe off easily, remove the glass and clean it in the dishwasher or with acetone or whatever. It is not limited to a dainty little damp rag!For material to be scanned, use compressed air to blow off dust. Use a microfiber cloth to wipe away finger oils: typical microfiber cleaning cloths have both oil-loving a d watar-loving fibers, which is why they can just wipe smudges off your touch screen without any liquids.  It will work the same for the photo prints.Use cotton gloves. They are sold for specifically for photography/concervation/archiving.

How can I improve my wireless keyboard & mouse reception?
Most people think of wireless as no wires coming from the computer, I realized, my computer needs some cables (power, video, network) so one more isn't going to hurt. I got a USB extension cable, and plugged the wireless receiver into that. I now have the cable with the receiver taped the underside of my desk right under where my keyboard sits (If you have a glass desk you may need to get more creative if you want to hide it). For all intents and purposes, my keyboard and mouse are wireless, but I still get great reception.
How can I clear my shower drain without drain cleaner?
For a temporary, over-the-weekend solution, try using depilatory -- women's hair remover cream or gel, or men's beard powder.  These preparations contain very mild hydroxides, akin to lye but much weaker (safe for multi-minute skin contact) -- but in a matter of an hour or so, will dissolve enough hair to weaken the clog and allow one of the other solutions (poor man's plunger, or very-very hot water) to finish the job -- without running out to buy something when shops are closed and you're wet and soapy.  Even better, they're something that might be on hand.As a bonus, they're mild enough that they won't harm even the cheap plastic pipe in a mobile home (they are, after all, safe for skin with limited exposure).
What is a good way to organise and identify keys on a keyring?
Since I have lots of different color permanent markers, but not lots of different colors of nail polish, I use my wife's clear nail polish.  Mark the key up with the sharpie - I usually put a dot on - and then a drop of clear nail polish to cover it and keep it on there.  Once dry, it stays on there forever -  or until you use nail polish remover to remove it.

How to reduce creepy crawly insects in the house?
One way I've taken care of spiders (and others that like a home in my home) is to remove their homes the first time you notice it. Clear webs as soon as you see them. Kill any spider you see. Use the spray others recommended. Keep food out of the room so their prey doesn't come around. They'll figure out it's not a good place for them. Maybe they'll stay in your housemates' rooms.My wife runs a bookstore. They sometimes pack sage with the books to repel silverfish. Burning it around the area works too though they don't do that in the store.

Optimal tissue blowing strategy?
You can tear each tissue in half before you use it, thereby getting two uses out of each tissue. Make sure to tear along the grain of the tissue paper, which is (in my experience) along the main crease in the tissue. You can stuff the unused half back into the box for later.
What is a good way to organise and identify keys on a keyring?
Since nobody has mentioned it: Split it up into multiple rings.  E.g. you can put your work keys on one ring, your home keys on another, and the car keys on a third, then link all the rings together.  This has the advantage that if you need to separate them for any reason (say, to give your car keys to the repair shop, or lend your home keys to the neighbor when you go on vacation so they can water your plants), it's as simple as separating that one ring.
Best (law-abiding) ways to inconvenience cold callers?
I sound interested then say "Wait a moment, I have to take something off the stove".Then walk away.  They hang up eventually.(I used to keep an emergency whistle by the phone - blowing it removes the eardrums of the caller.  But that probably isn't legal and it annoyed the neighbours)
How to keep your hands warm while biking outside without using bulky gloves
You could try using "pogies". These are sleeves that are attached to your handlebars, allowing you to slip your hands in and out easily. Pogies allow you to go barehanded when you would normally need gloves and to wear light gloves when you would normally need heavy mitts. 
How to keep your hands warm while biking outside without using bulky gloves
Two variations over the same idea, and that is to make cover for the bike handles.Build an air deflector on the bike handlesIf you are a little handy, you could build air deflectors around the bike handlebars, which would deflect the cold air from your hands. This would in turn mean that you could use ordinary bike gloves for much longer, as the hands are not directly in the cold turbulent air flowing around your handlebars.Use cayak mitts or paddle mittsIn the winter time when paddling at sea I've used these and they are really comforting. I foresee that you can use these mitts around bike handlebar as well. If you use a large enough pair, you leave the mitts on the bike, and then simply insert hands with bike gloves into the mitts when you want to ride your bike. Update: Here is an article listing specific mitts for biking similar to the kayak mitts.
Best (law-abiding) ways to inconvenience cold callers?

Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
If you have a little time and are in a reasonably small space, there is a technique that will make it much easier to catch (or kill) the fly.First a bit of background. A chemical called Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is required for muscle contraction. When a muscle fiber contracts, it consumes a tiny amount of ATP from its reservoir. It takes a bit of time to refill the reservoir, so a lot of muscle activity will deplete the reservoir and make muscle contraction quite difficult.  This occurs in your own muscles and, more importantly, in a fly's wing muscles.The idea then is to simply keep the fly flying until such time as it has used up so much ATP that it simply cannot react to even the slowest attempt to swat it.What I try to do is corral the fly into a small room in the house (bathrooms work best), often using the "single light on" trick mentioned in @Mooseman's answer.  Then whenever the fly lands I wave my rolled up newspaper (or whatever) at it in order alarm it and keep it flying.  Over time, the fly reacts more and more slowly to this harassment.  After a few minutes I can just tap the fly with my weapon of choice with no trouble whatsoever.
Best (law-abiding) ways to inconvenience cold callers?
When the cold caller asks for you, say "Just a moment, I'll get them." and then place the phone next to the stereo and let it play, like hold music.  Every once in a while get back on in your best message machine voice and say "Your call is very important to us, please stay on the line and your call will be answered in the order it was received." Having been a cold caller in the past (shudder, nightmares) I can tell you that after a while they will make a note not to call you back.

Best (law-abiding) ways to inconvenience cold callers?
I note you're in the UK, where, very recently, a landmark change has been made in the law written to protect consumers from this type of harassment. Link below to a report by the BBC, but you need to find out the name of the company which is calling, then tell them you're going to report them to the Information Commissioner's Office - I'm pretty sure they'll be aware of the massive fine issued recently to a particular company harassing people regarding PPI claims.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31616523Alternatively, do what I do - I am really, really rude and act furious. As soon as I realise what the call's about, I cut right across them and say where'd you get my number from, then carry on with something like (with a withering, sarcastic tone) I haven't had any PPI nor have I had an accident, but you will if you ever call this number again, remove it from your list immediately. I even throw in the fact they've had the temerity to disturb my dinner and how dare they (I've heard them apologise while I'm still ranting). For politeness on the site, I have left out the expletives; these may be none, very few or many and varied, depending on how bored/irritated I am, usually finishing with two little words used the world over and cutting the caller off. Funnily enough, they don't ring back...not really sure why, might be because I'm female and they feel like their mum has just given them a roasting, given the callers are always male, and they don't want to face it again.
How to keep shoes from coming untied?
The standard trick when I was a kid was to use shoe laces that were a few inches longer than the minimum, and after tying the laces normally with extra long bow loops, tie the bow loops in a half hitch over the existing knot.  Works great, but it's a good bit more work to untie intentionally...
How to keep shoes from coming untied?
Nylon laces are slippery, though strong. Pine resin (sap) dissolved in alcohol or acetone makes an effective anti-slip agent. Apply a bit to the laces at the knot, or dip them in it. The knot can still be untied, but it takes more effort.An alternative is to replace nylon with cotton laces... but I find they break more often. Even better, elastic shoe laces stay tied and stretch a bit so that shoes can be slipped on, a help when one has arthritis.
How to Avert / Deflect refrigerator heat in room?
The question is: Do you need a freezer? Many people can live without one. Instead of using ice from a freezer, you can use cold water from the fridge. Since the fridge is only at about 4C, and not -18C as the freezer, you get less heat transfer whence less heat produced.In general, the smaller the fridge area to the outside, the better for efficiency (with 0 being the best). Actually, the old fridges with the freezer inside the fridge were better in this sense, since you didn't have any heat leakage from the freezer, just from the fridge.
Best (law-abiding) ways to inconvenience cold callers?
Well, this doesn't apply to the UK specifically but here's my approach:Never answer unsolicited calls from an unknown number. From anyone. Ever. Calls from a number that I don't recognize go straight to voice mail. If they don't leave a message, they'll never hear back from me.

In my country, when you receive this kind of call, they usually ask your occupation right from the start, if you are employed and all, and then they decide if it's actually viable to continue the call.If that's the case, I find that it's most effective to say that you are unemployed, with no income of any sort. This seems to work really well, at least with me, because they usually have a database where they try to trace your profile to see if you are a potential customer, which services would attract your attention...But if you can't afford their services, well, it's a total waste of their time to call you, at least in the near future. I rarely receive this type of call now.
Best (law-abiding) ways to inconvenience cold callers?
One solution is (and this depends whether in your country telemarketers target private or business numbers) to tell the callers you're not a private (or a business) number, whichever they're not interested in. Telemarketers are interested in people who can listen to their talks (automated or in-person) so if it's not possible, they will cross you off the list soon.Another way is to set your phone in fax machine mode (real or faked) while you're not expecting any calls. Surely, cold callers have systems in place to quickly stop trying on numbers that appear to be impossible to get people on.

The technical solution:There are more pricey routers available which are able to connectto a telephone line (like AVM Fritz!Box). After the setup you canfilter every call which suppresses the number (which is almostalways the case because the cold callers do know that theyare illegal) and you have two options:a) Blocking. The calls are never connected.b) Answering machine (the answering machine is completely silent,   you do not even notice if someone on the machine, it is only   indicated by blinking). I set up   the voice of the answering machine to silence (or if you want,   use heavy breathing...) and the call-center worker does not    realize he is on an answering machine >:-).This is also a wonderful tool against stalkers and phone harassment:Simply set up all unknown calls to the answering machine and only allow trusted people to call you personally. In case of harassment it is betterto use recording to have evidence, the user interface of the router gives you the number and the exact time of the call.@chasley:I would like to give a way to inconvienience the bosses, but that isnot possible. One investigative journalist from Germany, Günter Wallraff (the very same which is famous for his quarrel with Bild),  worked undercover for a call center. They are hiring jobless workers or workers with low income, partly with support from the official job center (hey, people are working, hooray). They get contracts not only from shady businesses, but also from big respectable firms (British Telecom). They simply do not care a bit, and you cannot inconvienience them legally.
How to find a spider when there is a spider web?
If the web is still inhabited by a spider, you could try to gently blow on the web. This will cause it to start vibrating, making the spider believe a bug is caught in it. It will come out of its hiding place (on one of the corners of the web) to sting the bug. This is when you can kill/catch it.

I have three fixes for this, with different results:As I am in the USA, my phone number has been on the Do Not Call list as long as the list has existed. I used to get good results reporting callers, but I think all the call centers have moved out of the USA, so this is no longer effective.As suggested in earlier responses "Please hold", put the phone down, get on with life, and hang up about 5 minutes later. Reasonably effective.The one that could completely solve the problem if more people used it: I keep a list of companies I am boycotting. Any business whose products or services are advertised during a cold call to me goes on the list for a year. During that period, I try very hard to avoid doing business with them even if I was a customer before the call. If more people did this, cold calling would result in a reduction in business, and companies would stop doing it.

You don't state where you live, but I'll assume UK since you've posted a question about UK over at academia.This means that Eur-Pallets should be readily available at your location; i found used ones on ebay for about €10 each. They are rated to hold 1250 kg, which should be more than enough for your use case.Fasten some wheels like these to the corners. Use the biggest screws you can get (that fit the holes); since the corners of the pallets are made of chunks of solid wood, they should hold on well. (Did you note that pallet+wheels are advertised as "often being sold together" on Amazon?)As half of your route is over grass, you'll probably want to get the largest wheels you can get, this will help with bumps. Skateboard wheels are another option if you can get them cheaply.You might even fix small pieces of wood to the top of the pallets to hold your stuff in place.Result:

This response only applies to calls by a real human agent:Several answers so far have suggested to tell the cold callers to wait a moment and put the phone down (indefinitely).I suggest an extended version: Ask them to explain the details of their offer. You do not have to listen to what they say, just make sure you are aware of when they finally stop talking. Then, say, you hadn't quite understood, or you had to leave for a moment, or something like that, and ask them to explain again1. Repeat until the annoyed cold caller hangs up.Yes, cold calling people is their job. I want them to work for the money they get, not idle. A job where you can idle much of the time is attractive. A job where you have to work endlessly and get a feeling that your work is in vain is unattractive. An unattractive job has a chance of requiring higher payment at some point, or at least a higher frequency of people quitting. Also, occupying more time of those cold callers sounds good, too. These are probably the only effects on the decision makers that can be achieved directly via the cold call itself.1: Make sure not to use any words that could be remixed to indicate agreement to buy anything. The details of this are language-specific, but for instance, when asked whether you'd like more information, don't respond "Yes, I do.", but rather something like "Explain, please."

My favourite is to actually answer most of the questions affirmatively until they hang up. This actually offers the most value, so for PPI claims, have you had an accident, why yes am glad you rang, when was it, only recently, were you injured, yes, but it was nothing; I was only off work for a couple of weeks and the aches are mostly cleared up now after six months, etc. You get the picture. If you tell them all six in the people carrier lost their legs they will normally spot the wind up. Often you will get past the outbound sales person and get someone a bit more knowledgable. 25 minutes is my best so far :) Another is: No, that doesn't suit, but my colleague in the office has/needs x or y. Then choose a speaker phone number that you can all gather round :) Make them wait a bit so you can get a coffee and some notepads to pass suggestions on :)

Have you ever mis-dialed a number and been greeted by a high pitched two-tone sound followed by a recorded message "the number you have reached..."?  Years ago, I had one a device (I think it was called a Tele Zapper) attached to my phone that did the same thing and it worked wonders.  As soon as the handset was picked up, it emitted that same two-tone sound telling the caller that my number was not in service.  People would stick around, but robocallers immediately disconnected - and purged my number from their system.

How to remove ants from seeds like falooda?
I'm not sure of the size of a falooda seed, but if the ants are larger then you should be able to shake them through a sieve (or fine colander) to separate them from the ants. Then you have a sieve full of ants, though, which is pretty icky.Another option, if it's all right to get them wet, is to submerge them in water. I believe the ants will most likely float, and you can skim them off the surface of the water. It may not work 100% the first time, so you may have to then pour out the water and transfer the falooda seeds to another water-filled pot.After the ants are removed, I recommend keeping your seeds in a sealed container.

There are some excellent ideas here. They have led me to an idea of my own so I shall answer my own question.Find out the private number of the people who run these businesses. Then pass that number on to every scam you can think of.  Get them onto every mailing list in the world. When they get home they will face an endless stream of other people trying to sell them something they don't want. Poetic justice!All I need to do now is find out who these people are and discover their home numbers and/or addresses. Hmm... not so easy.  If it is a well-known firm then their work number would do. Imagine them spending all day picking up the phone to other morons who are just as irritating as they are.What do people think? Is this workable? If so I might even set up a name and shame website. Set them on each other and let them get on with it!
Best (law-abiding) ways to inconvenience cold callers?
What has worked for me in the past is to actually just waste their time. When telemarketers call, I use it as an opportunity to get to know a stranger. Ask them about their life, the weather, where they are, etc. If you act really sort of happy and genuinely interested in what kind of people do this job and how they live, or what got them into it, you can easily waste 30 minutes of their time.I once asked this guy on the phone about what time it was, where he was and what kind of place was it, about his family, or girlfriends, etc. Every time they answer, you just ask another sort of "get to know you" kind of question. I really tried to build a friendship with the guy, and he felt really comfortable telling me all kinds of things. Then he said "Well, my friend, let me ask you about...", and I just hung up on him. I wasted lots of his time, the company's money, and I learned something interesting about life outside my bubble. If you got enough people to spend 30 minutes on the phone to not make a sale, you would affect the profits.Of course, this doesn't work with robot calls, but then you really should have caller ID by now, and just never answer "Unknown Caller" or suspicious numbers anyway.Either way... yea, it can waste your time too - if you really had something to do - and there might be better solutions out there, but I figure you're doing two things: you're growing as a person, and being a turd in "The Man's" punchbowl. It's not much, but even small drips of water can cut stone over time.

Personally, I go along with it, but give them fake stories.It's a call about the accident I had?  I go off for hours, start crying, explaining how it gives me nightmares, I close my eyes and all I see is the headlights coming towards me.It's PPI? It's how my dear wife killed herself due to financial worries, if only the PPI had paid out.It's "Microsoft" calling up about my computer problems? I suddenly become the most inept computer operator you'll ever meet; one finger typing, not being able to follow simple instructions, reading every damn thing on the screen except what they want etc etc. Sometimes they catch on quite quickly. The longest I've had was the PC one where I kept a guy on the phone for 45 minutes. The longer they're not scamming me, the longer they're not scamming someone else. 
How to reset sleep schedule
As Bamboo mentioned, You cannot realistically expect to be doing physical activity, at 10PM and come home, eat, then pass out easily, especially if you nap during the day. Think of it this way, a common method before going to sleep is to remove yourself from electronics and bright screens etc. The reason is because this will help cue the biological signals of our brain, that it is time for rest. If you stay up on a computer, looking at the screen, processing information (watching videos, learning about something etc), your brain activity will be high, and it takes a while for your body to slow down (think of car temperatures, it takes a while for your car to go from normal operating temp, to cold (hours of time). I would ditch napping as the first thing, this will make you more tired (at least until you get into a CONSISTENT sleeping schedule)NOTES: Make Mornings Bright. Light tells your body's clock when it's time towake up. Keep Nights Dark. At night, dim the lights to cue your bodythat it's time for sleepWORKING OUT Needs to be before noon. A high-intensity cardio workout late        in the day can disrupt sleepBefore your target sleep time: To prepare your body for bed, try doing something to relax.

How to move heavy (~50kg) bulky (~1m cubed) items a short (1km) distance?
I find moving heavy objects on some sort of "base" is easiest by just "walking" them.  That is, tilt them to the side a bit so part of the base is raised, push that side forward, let it down, tilt the other way, etc.  Kind of a rocking motion, back and forth. If you think of the far 2 sides of the base as the "feet", you'll see the "walking" action .. ;)If it's sports equipment, it sounds sturdy enough to stand up to this type of movement. (some things are fragile enough this doesn't work well ;) )This works nicely regardless of terrain, I've moved large cement blocks up stairs using this method as well. Fairly easy to manage on your own. Good luck![edit]hmm, when I first read the question, I saw the "short distance" .. now I just noticed "1km" (funny definition of "short")... hehwell, it'll get the item to the car, anyway .. ;) lol[/edit]

If you berate the person with obscenities, most of the time the person on the other end will take you off their list.  An ex-gf used to work a call center and that was one of the only ways to get taken off - since if the employer didn't allow the person marked off the employees could sue for hostile work environment.This is perfectly legal and allows you to blow of steam, if you are morally capable of doing this.
Best (law-abiding) ways to inconvenience cold callers?
All the answer seem to be torturous or far-crys or abnormal stuff.Here are some legal and normal answers:If they are trying to sell something, just tell them that you already have that. They would stop trying to sell that specific thing.Also what also works is telling you know what they are doing. Saying "I know that you are trying to scam me, I'm not an idiot, but you are for trying to scam me. Never call back." and hanging up will probably keep them away from you. (calling someone an idiot might be considered hate crime, according to the caller, removing the ", but you are for trying to scam me" will help you secure yourself)Giving a life lecture works well too: "Do you really want to be a scammer? Is prison where you want to end your life?[...]" They usually hang up to this, and don't call you anymore.

How to get rid of the 'farmyard' smell from a goose down pillow?
Buy a better quality (but much more expensive) pillow. I did this and the manufacturer's process for cleaning the down before use is extreme, involving several washes and removal of unwanted material - hence the price.My pillow has no detectable smell. Alternatively remove the down from the pillow and subject it to your own regime of tough cleaning before returning it to the pillowcase. My guess is that you will only have to do this once - the farmyard smell won't come back.P.S. Possible cleaning method (with disclaimer) - I have no idea if it will work, but remove the down and soak it overnight in a bucket of biological washing powder to remove organic matter. As I say, this part is guesswork so try with a sample first and don't blame me if something goes wrong.

Skateboard, roller blades or?
Skyrunners are fine if you're actually going to run all the way, but you'd probably need a shower afterwards. A bike would be good, but again, you'd probably need a shower AND somewhere to chain the bike up for the day.I'd go for rollerblades or rollerboots - you can take those off and keep in a bag for the journey (the same bag you'll have our shoes in on the way to the station if you get the ones you don't wear shoes with). You'd get there faster without running at all. Electric scooter is the second option, not sure which of those would take up less room in a crowd, but I don't think a scooter would fit in a bag...

Optimal tissue blowing strategy?
I used to have the same problem. I would go through a whole huge box of tissues with every cold. And... now I don't. It is very rare that I need very many any more. I don't know why this changed... but it changed at the same time I stopped eating anything with pesticide, perservatives, artificial color/flavor, etc. and eat more saturated fat (especially butter and full fat milk), and avoid anything processed. (which was about 10 years ago).Also anything you can get with lots of proper vitamin D3 (possibly not synthetic added stuff like in pasteurized milk) should help, but you have to take it earlier ... maybe before the symptoms. Organic butter made from milk in the spring (which looks more yellow but does not list color in ingredients) is one good food source. Another food source is liver. A good natural suppliment source is cod liver oil. And the best source is sunlight... which is not in good supply during the winter, which is most likely why colds are more common in the winter. The idea of temperature having anything to do with it is not supported in any scientific way.Also I find that drinking less water, or drinking less at once, spread out over more time helps... but can't say if that's healthy or not.

How best to prolong the shelf life of eggs?
In addition to whatever other method you find, buy eggs straight from the farmer (at his farm or the market). It's cheaper, better for the local economy, and they are fresh. The store bought eggs may be many weeks old already, and they have ridiculous regulations (varies by region, may also affect your farmer direct ones), like using soap or hot water to wash them, which (1) removes protective natural coatings and (2) due to hot and then cold temperature sucks dirt in the pores of the shell. Ask the farmer how he washes them. (and the best answer may be "not at all", so don't reject that answer... the best is to wash them before you use them rather than before buying)
How to stop fitted sheets from creeping off a mattress after sleeping on it?
I had a creeping mattress topper (memory foam). I solved it with double sided carpet tape. This works but of course I don't have to remove the topper to wash it and you would with the sheets.You can also buy rug slip stoppers. They are not adhesive so you can remove and replace the sheet. They are designed to stop sideways travel. They are also breathable. One problem comes if they prefer sticking to the sheet rather than the mattress! You then have to use double-sided tape to fix the rug-grip to the mattress! The real problem comes if the fabric of the sheet or the mattress cover won't grip or suffers from pilling. Not sure if I am recommending these ideas but at least you are aware of the pluses and minuses!

Pair of rimless prescription titanium glasses : screws fit into frame but strips. Hack to fix?
You have the answer, and I've used it. Drilling out the hole is quite easy, since it's just enlarging the hole already there to remove the threads. Use a tungsten carbide drill bit and hand-hold the bit -- just a few turns with finger-tips should bore out the threads.N.B. Tungsten carbide is hard but quite brittle, so do not apply any force other than gentle twist and pressure. Do not force the bit sideways.
Laptop doesn't want to start without charger. Battery is full
This happened to my father's laptop once. Assuming your OS is Windows, the cause and solution may be the same. Windows laptops insist on a minimum battery % to stay on; and sometimes, for whatever reason, that % gets set too high. (It was 100% in his case, hence the "can't stay on" problem. Maybe that happened to you.) Go to Control Panel, Power Options, Advanced settings*, Battery, and make sure the Critical, Low and Reserve battery levels are all low. (* In modern operating systems you reach Advanced Settings via Change plan settings, Changed advanced power settings.)
Is it possible to use aluminium foil as heatsink?
Bad idea.. The lateral heat spreading into 0.1mm foil will be 20x less than into 2mm Al plate, so save up and buy the plate if you have anything above 100mW to keep cool.Is it possible?  Get a handbook of materials, look up the thermal conductivity, look up handbooks of heat transfer, and you should be able to confirm that a 2mm square of 0.1mm foil will help with loads in the 1mW to 20mW range but be insufficient for anything much bigger.
Laptop doesn't want to start without charger. Battery is full
Lithium-ion batteries, the most common type of batteries found in laptops today, deteriorate faster when kept fully charged (e.g. when you leave your device plugged in all the time). To preserve your battery's life, it's recommended to let it cycle between low charge levels and high charge levels. Some devices even offer the ability to limit charging to 80% to prevent the deteriorating effects of keeping your device at 100% in exchange for about 20% of its mobile/unplugged capacity.How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries shows an example table about how performance is affected by temperature and charge level.Temperature | 40% charge | 100% charge | Table 3: Estimated recoverable capacity0°C         | 98%        | 94%         | when storing Li-ion for one year at various 25°C        | 96%        | 90%         | temperatures40°C        | 85%        | 65%         | Elevated temperature hastens permanent capacity loss.60°C        | 75%        | 60%         | Not all Li-ion systems behave the same.            |            | (3 months)  |As you can see, a battery kept at 100% will lose more of its capacity than a battery kept at a much lower charge; lower operating temperatures are better. Once a battery's maximum charge has reached the minimum threshold necessary to use your device, you'll find it can no longer run the device, even when charged at 100%.This page also demonstrates how cycling the battery between low and high charges can preserve its life. The device should be unplugged pretty frequently to allow the battery a partial discharge, which will reduce the effects of deterioration. 100% discharge is not recommended on a daily basis, as this is also harmful. The following table shows how many cycles a battery can go through before reaching 70% of its initial capacity.Depth of discharge | Discharge cycles | Table 2: Cycle life as a function of100% DoD           | 300 – 500        | depth of discharge50% DoD            | 1,200 – 1,500    | A partial discharge reduces stress and 25% DoD            | 2,000 – 2,500    | prolongs battery life.10% DoD            | 3,750 – 4,700    | Elevated temperature and high currents also affect                                         cycle life.If you read the table, you'll see that the best thing you can do for the battery is to fairly constantly discharge 10% of its life then recharge it. In practice, this is a pretty tall order, but you can install software on some devices that will do this for you if you're constantly plugged in. Alternatively, some devices have a "BIOS screen" that allows you to configure maximum charges-- refer to your device's manual. In practice, simply running your device to about 50% before plugging it back in to top it off will yield thousands of duty cycles with about an hour of maximum use time in terms of capacity loss.At this point, it's likely that you need to replace your battery. As far as the hack goes (since we are on LHSE), install software on your device that limits charging to 80% or less (unless you know you need the extra charge), use external cooling devices if you're in a hot environment or run processor-intensive work (to keep the device cooler, prolonging battery life), and unplug your device when not in use or at least once a day or so, allowing it to drain to about 20% before plugging it back in.You can verify if you need to replace your battery by running the command mentioned here if you're on Windows. Linux and Mac OS also have similar features available to them.To get information about the current state of your battery, open your start menu, then go to Accessories > Command Prompt, right-click and choose "Run as administrator", then type in the following command:powercfg -energy -output %userprofile%\desktop\energy-report.htmlOnce the command completes in a minute or two, go to your desktop and open the file that will appear there. Near the bottom will be a section that shows information about your battery. Here's the actual numbers from my device:Design Capacity   31680Last Full Charge  25963This shows that my device's battery is at about 82% of its original designed limits (25963/31680 is 0.8195391414...). Go ahead and try this command out on your device. I'm pretty sure that since your device can't even run without its adapter, your ratio will be pretty close to 0%, but there is simply a minimum charge level that's required for the battery to run, so it will probably be higher than 0, but far less than 50%.
How to keep track of how many uses a razor blade has left
Although my "stack of cards" answer was pretty popular, I came up with another idea that I've started using myself. It works for disposable razors, but it might also work on your disposable blades.Get a fine-point permanent pen.Each time the blade is used, draw a small "tick mark" on the blade.When you get to 10 ticks (maybe 5 ticks on the right and 5 on the left?), it's time to replace the blade.(I've been drawing the tick marks on the handle of my disposable razors.)
How to keep track of how many uses a razor blade has left
Our solution ended up being simple, but specific to our setup. I have accepted the most popular answer, but I share my solution in case it helps anybody else. I have a shelf/alcove in my shower that looks similar to this:We store our razor in this alcove. When we change the blade and use it for the first time, we place it on the tile furthest to the left. Each time one of us uses the blade, we move it one tile to the right when we put it back. When the razor has reached the 3rd or 4th tile, I know its time to replace the blade.

You may try to spill some salt on the area. Salt would drain some oil from backpack. After that, you have to wash your backpack with soap. :/Sorry for the incident
What can I punch?
A 50 lb bag of dog food inside a sleeping bag or large laundry bag may provide a satisfying impact without significant risk of hand injury.  Failing that, a well-stuffed bag of laundry can also sub for a heavy bag.  Either one can be upgraded with a printed photo or drawing of a face taped on.
How to remove tuna oil from backpack?
Having to deal with the same kind of problem in the past (olive oil in a backpack), I recommend you wash your backpack or the oiled part with really hot water, gently rubbing it with the hands, using gloves if you don't stand hot water.Depending of the material composing your backpack, only water should not damage it, even hot. Be careful though with glued parts like straps, as really hot water could make it melt.

Roll up a carpet onto a PVC pipe (or onto a tall wooden cylinder, if you like hard center) and secure it with some duct tape.Take a lot of duct tape and cover the whole thing with duct tape to make it tighter and more durableAs a base, use a big bag of sand or an old parasol stand if you have one around. Whatever you use, make sure it is well joined.As a reference, see this YouTube Video.
How to stop fitted sheets from creeping off a mattress after sleeping on it?
This may take a little bit of work, but the first thing that came to my mind was to make the sheets have a drawstring. As long as the sheets are deep enough cover your entire mattress and fold slightly underneath, you could cut a small slit in the seam where the elastic is, attach a safety pin to a long cord and use it to feed the cord through the elastic channel and out the other side. Pull it tight, and then tie a slip knot (or some other easy to remove knot) and voila, no slippage.
What can I punch?
Following are two different types of punching bags. To mount them onto a base, you could use a similar method as mentioned before, with a PVC pipe and an old parasol stand, or maybe you even have a small (but bigger than a gallon) water tank and could fill that one up with sand.Probably simplest punching bagGet a rice bag.Fill it with rice if it isn't already.Do not punch without gloves. You could still wrap it with duct tape to make it even more durable.Using old clothes or grocery bagsGet a laundry bag or (at least) two garbage bags.Fill it with (shredded) old clothes (hoodies, jeans, etc.) or stuff it with a lot of crumpled up plastic grocery bags.If you use garbage bags I recommend covering the bag with one or two layers of duct tape. To be sure, you can also wrap the laundry bag with duct tape.To protect your wrists, also use gloves when punching this bag.Be creative! Use this as inspiration. You can basically use any type of bag or stuffing. It's just a matter of how hard you like your punching bag, or in this case, punching dummy.
How to remove tuna oil from backpack?
First, if you are afraid of the green color will run, don't use hot water!Make sure to use cold/regular cold tap water when washing your backpack. To get rid of oil, if there's too much of it, I suggest soaking it up with paper towel first. If it's already spread out and soaked by your backpack, I suggest using extra detergent/dish soap on that spot. You should apply detergent/dish soap on it multiple times until the oil is pretty much gone. Each time you wash off the detergent/dish soap, some oil will be taken away by detergent. Please take a look at my answer for "how to wash a backpack" to give your backpack a final rinse after getting rid of most oil. To get rid of the smell, hopefully after washing the spot with detergent so many time would get rid of the smell. But if it doesn't, you can probably get a box of baking soda and leave it in your backpack for a couple days after it's dried. The same way baking soda would get rid of the smell in your fridge, it will get rid of the smell in your backpack. Hope this helps! :)

You could either place them somewhere high up or in a closet. Unless your cats are ninja cyborgs from the future, I doubt they can open a closet door (or drawer or other aperture of similar use).
Alternatives to sleep masks and black-out curtains
You could sleep in your basement (if you have one). Most basements have a tiny slit window that would allow a small amount of natural light in (if none at all) and you could move a small mattress in there for use during the day.

I used to know a martial arts expert. He turned the newel post at the bottom of his stairs into a target by padding it heavily. He used it both for kicking and punching. He would attack it every time he went past.
Alternatives to sleep masks and black-out curtains
You state that you don't want the two most common solutions, which is to black out the entire room somehow, or using sleep mask. By far I think these are better than most other options, but that is me.Another option could be to black out only a part of your room, namely the part where you upper body (and head) is. In other words a canopy bed of some sort. Either a fully enclosed canopy bed, or maybe just a partially enclosure for just the upper part.Think like a mosquito net, but only in a darker material, whilst still allowing air to flow through the contraption. This would allow for you to move during the night, and still to have it dark.DIY solution of partial canopy bedIf you have to build it your self, I would consider using dark light proof curtains for the three walls at either side of bed and the top end of the bed. For the last wall you could use the same fabric, but double it up with some distance between them.                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    ~~ | ^ v  isBED - BED - BED v BED - BED - BED |    curtain parts-               v               - |   B               v   ^           B |    B E D -   isE               v   ^           E |    the bed frameD               v   ^           D |-                   ^           - |BED - BED - BED - BE^ - BED - BED |                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In my beautiful, ascii art, illustration of bed viewed from above. In the middle of the illustration you'll see that the one from the top, v, only goes almost over the bed, similar to the one going from the bottom, ^. This allows a corridor of air to flow.You could (possibly should) do similar arrangements on the other curtain walls to ensure proper air flow. You could also experiment with how high you need the curtains to go, it is not given that they must extend to the ceiling/roof. And lastly, if your bed is in a corner, you most likely don't need to have curtains against the actual walls of the room.PS: The partial closure used over the bed, can also be used around a window in fixed materials, which would darken the entire room but still allow air to flow.
How to stop cats from chewing my headphones?
The only way to absolutely guarantee that your headphones don't get chewed on is to place them in a container that the cats cannot open.  Do not assume that just because the container is difficult to imagine opening by a cat that it will be impossible (or even difficult).  I have seen cats knock things off the counter just to break open a container.You can find a lot of example videos of cats opening things they shouldn't be able to: Cat opens door with round doorknobFind a hardened container with multiple catches to prevent the cat from getting to your headphones.  Add foam to keep the headphones from rattling around inside.
How can I neutralize the odor of Tide washing detergent?
I am in the very same boat so I understand completely.  The only thing I have found to help is a product called OdorKlenz.  I purchased mine on Amazon.  For clothing which retains some odor (perfume or other detergent smells) you can add it to the washer as directed.  For items which are heavily laden with the Tide or Cheer scents, that will not be enough.  I utilize a large muck bucket and soak the article in this product with enough water to cover.  I have MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivities).  I don a pair of rubber gloves and swish the clothing to make certain the product is pushed through them.It may soak for one-three days, depending on the strength of the fragrance you detect.  Then I transfer the clothing to the washer and use this product as it recommends in the machine.  You may have to repeat this process, but you will notice a substantial reduction in the fragrance of the clothing.  Good luck, there are millions of us who are in the same shoes as yourself. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00289VGJU?keywords=odor%20klenz&qid=1445389805&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1
Help achieving real-time auto-tune effect
The original voice methods that gave rise to auto-tune involved playing sound from an instrument into either the throat or mouth.  The famous "talking guitar" is the oldest of these I'm aware of; it used a headphone type speaker with a tube to feed the sound into the performer's mouth as he lip-synced or whispered the words.  This is low-tech stuff, originally operated from a guitar and tube amp, though it would probably work for any sufficiently loud instrument in the human vocal range.  The performer can open his throat (breathing in or out) to add resonance, as long as the sound is within the range he'd normally sing.  Using a microphone/PA to amplify the resulting voice effect will make it loud enough to fill a room.
Help achieving real-time auto-tune effect
I think the most compact way of doing something like this would be using a vocoder setting on a Korg Kaoss Pad. I'm not an expert on Kaoss Pads but I'm sure they have a vocoder patch. This takes one signal and modulates it with another, so you should be able to modulate the pitch of your voice with a tune either programmed in to the Kaoss Pad or from something like an external MP3 player. You would also need a microphone and some form of amplification, but it should be possible in much less space than a backpack. A good music shop would be able to tell you how get it working. You might also want to look up the term "vocoder" in your mobile device app store. Autotune is a brand name and is more of a studio thing than a real time performance thing. Autotune is really about changing the pitch to be right on the note. Mostly, it is meant to be unnoticeable, but Taylor Swift and countless other modern pop stars aren't fooling me. I think you might be looking for general vocal effect processing.As for isolating your microphone, that really comes down to the type and quality of microphone and the environment you are using it in.
How to stop fitted sheets from creeping off a mattress after sleeping on it?
We solved this problem by sewing (rather large, like half dollar coin (USD) sized) buttons to the corners of the fitted sheets. We have velcro straps that cross underneath the mattress, and slip them over the buttons when making the bed after washing sheets. This causes the four corners to get extra pull towards the center.The only thing that has managed to undo this is a toddler who thought our bed was a trampoline. We then stitched the buttons back on with significantly more thread and thicker backing material, nothing has inadvertently undone it since.
How to stop cats from chewing my headphones?
Building on the idea of Adam Zuckerman regarding casing of sorts, I would like to draw your attention to earbud cases (as from a google search). These has loads of variations, but most of them should solve your problem.Some manufacturers sell the earbuds with decent casings, and it is worth it to look for one of those sets. Cases comes in multiple variants; closed cases, case where you twist the leads into the case, or open variants where the headphone wires are still somewhat available to the cat.Note that also ordinary headphones can come with decent casings, and some of these headphones are collapsable before you enclose them in the casing.
How to repair and clean traffic cones?
Cleaning tipIn my world, if something was really dirty we used White spirit (also known as Mineral spirit in the US) which took care of most dirt in various forms (including oil, paint, different industrial glues, etc.). In some rare cases we needed to use Acetone (commonly found in nail polish remover). After cleaning with either of these, we used ordinary dish washer soap to get all the oily residues of whatever we were washing, before ending with a rinse of pure water. This wash procedure should be possibly to apply to the traffic cones as well. Do note that both White spirit and Acetone are somewhat toxic and should only be used in well ventilated areas, and handled with care.Some links related to cleaning of oil and tar and some informations on solvents and thinners:How to Remove Tar From a Plastic Bath Tub from http://homeguides.sfgate.com/Housecleaning: How do I remove gummy oil off of plastic? from http://www.quora.com/Solvents and thinners from http://artsparx.com/Band repairsYou'll get some loss of reflective tape almost any way you apply it. Trying to apply it in horizontal stripes will fail with a non smooth finish. Simple vertical stripes will either have a lot of overlap, or gaps at the top. My solution would be to use slanted strips parallell to each other, and then cut the top and bottom ring clean.Procedure suggestion:Make two circles on the cone. One indicating the top edge of the reflective area, and one indicating the bottom edge of the reflective area. This can be done with a marker, and the cone on a rotating chair or similarStarting at the top edge, start with the reflective tape just above the top circle, so that there will be a small triangle above the circleLet the tape go on slant, say 30°, down to the lower circleWhen crossing the lower circle, cut it along the circleRestart at the top, and now you'll see that the tape when put parallell to the previous tape would leave a smaller triangle on top of the circleTape it parallell all the way to the lower circle, and repeat this procedure cutting of the excess pieces as you go along
How to repair and clean traffic cones?
Here is my current solution. First of all, I cut every old and dirty reflective sticker with a utility knife:Now it looks like that:I used a green roughed dish sponge with Cif Cream to rub, and cleaned with water.I bought large reflective rulo from an advertising banner shop in the city center, then I cut it into lots of rectangular pieces. Each has almost the same length & width:After that, I put these pieces onto the cleaned surfaces of the traffic cones. While I was doing this, I needed to force the surface inside to attach the sticker correctly on to the straight side. Even though the surface is cone shaped, when I forced the material inside and under, thanks to the surface's flexible material (not all, just some of them are soft), it performed as if the area was flat. I put the sticker on smoothly with ease:You can easily see when you are near the cones, I had unwanted and unneccessary corners when we put the stickers on. I used a utility knife to modify all corners in order to look good.I know that these methods are not original. According to the traffic safety, I must clean and repair these old traffic cones.

I had to change my behavior in order to keep my cats from chewing my headphones. I made it a point to put my headphones up on a hook that my cats cannot access without my holding them up. There is not much you can do to change the instinct your cats have for chasing after string-like objects, so you should change your behavior to make the headphones less available.
How to avoid background reflection Computer display
As long as you can't block the major light sources easily, then you need a Monitor filter (wikipedia), which has anti glare or anti reflex/reflective behaviour. These can be bought commercially for at somewhat steep prices, or different DIY solutions available at cheaper prices.Do a google search for anti reflex screen to get you started, which reveals both some commercial options and a DIY anti glare solution. Suggestions for the DIY could be to use something called quilters plastic template, which can be overlayed onto your screen and make it quite a lot better. If you have some translucent thin plastic, it is well worth to try it in front of your screen.

You can knit a privacy sock. The one in the image is for a laptop, but I'm sure the design can be adapted. It's a sock that covers your head and your monitor, so no one can see your display but you. A side effect is that no significant lighting reaches your monitor.
Removing duct tape from my car without paint damage?
If you can peel up enough of a corner to get a grip with pliers, you can then use ice, cold gas/canned air (upside down), etc. to freeze the adhesive, and peel the tape off when the adhesive weakens from the cold.  Once the cloth part is off, kerosene, WD-40, or even peanut butter do a fine job removing the adhesive that's left behind.Assuming you're careful with the pliers and use something soft (like a Bondo applicator, about a dollar at the parts store) to scrape up the corner where you start, this won't do anything to common auto paints.
What can I punch?
You could get an old camping tarp and fill it with bags of flour, or even some dirt.  It will have a good weight to it, but won't be overly solid, and if you don't have the tarp, looks like you can pick one up at Wal-mart for $10 - $15 (in the US anyway).If you go the dirt route, you would have the added benefit of the manual labor which could potentially help to de-stress as well, if you're that kind of person. The problem with dirt, however, is if you end up getting rocks in it.  Might hurt to punch

A large pile of dough is perfect for this activity.  Satisfying smack, safe soft material, and then the opportunity to enjoy a meal afterwards; pizza dough would be preferable for the post-workup meal.
How do I easily divide dough into thirds?
You could measure it out using your hand. Roll out the dough to be close to the width of three hands, and then cut each piece at the width of your hand. It is fairly easy to make an even roll, and the width of your hand is fairly constant, so that should make for three closely sized lumps of dough.Added: Another variant using a measuring trick, is to first make an even roll, then use the tip of your digits(/fingers) not including the thumb to make a line of dots along the length of the roll. Then you can count the dots and divide by three.
How do I easily divide dough into thirds?
Break off a piece such that the remaining piece is twice as large.  Then break that large piece in half.
How do I easily divide dough into thirds?
Another trick: make an evenly roll, lay it down in a S-form and push it together. It works quite well after a bit of practice. Main advantage: you can add more "loops" to make 4, 5, and more parts. The roll needs to be thinner and thinner, so there is some natural limit to it but even I with my all-thumbs hands can manage up to 7. 
How to remove sticky color from iron box
The reason why color sticks to the iron box is because the temperature of the box would have been beyond the melting temperature of the fabric that was ironed. And over a few more ironing sessions, this will collect dust and other colors and wold have turned black. One way of removing the color off the iron box is to allow it to heat to a moderate level and using a wooden stick, try scraping off the color.
How to reduce Dust in an appartment - use sticky tape?
There is absolutely no way that you can avoid dust totally. Even in the cleanest of all environments, there is some amount of dust present which might even be particles of dead skin that would have dropped off during change of clothes or even during body movement.If you have observed chip and watch manufacturing companies where environment needs to absolutely dust free, all the workers will be in suits that hold dust from getting outside the suit's clothing. It is for the very same reason of dead skin flaking off. In short, there can be absolutely no "Dust free" environment.
How do I easily divide dough into thirds?
Try fashioning an equilateral (all 3 sides of the same lenght) triangle with the dough. Make sure it is level (height needs to be uniform). Then, simply cut the dough in half from each angle of the triangle (so 3 cuts). You'll get 6 pieces of equal mass. Add these pieces 2 by two and you get 3 pieces of equal mass.[EDIT, since it was requested in the comments, here's a little addendum : if you don't want 6 pieces, simply don't make cuts all the way through in length. Stop cutting at 2/3 of the length between the corner and the opposing side of the triangle (see picture). You really don't need to be accurate there.]The solution doesn't remove the need to be accurate, but makes being accurate easier (the geometrical form will favor accuracy, as it is more visual than simply guessing the size of each piece).Choose any other geometrical form if you need to make more pieces (a square for 4 pieces, etc...)
How can I drain the water from a saucepan of pasta without a colander?

How do I easily divide dough into thirds?
Here's an old math trick that makes dividing dough into thirds easy.Flatten your dough into a bit of a disk and mark the center point as a reference.Find a convenient object with an "edge" that is slightly larger than the radius of your dough and flatten your dough a bit further until it is about that size.(You can use a ruler, but I find an index card or a spatula edge to be about right)Using that edge as a reference, you can "walk" the outside of the circle, marking off equal lengths as you go.When you're done, you will find six equally-spaced marks along the ouside of your dough which will form the points of a perfect hexagon. Cutting from the center of your dough to every other point you made should divide the dough into equal thirds.
How do I easily divide dough into thirds?
Divide to three pieces arbitrarily, then just cut away and eat slices from the currently biggest part until all three pieces are equal.
How do I easily divide dough into thirds?
Start with a square.  Divide it into four sub-squares.  Set aside three of the sub-squares.  Divide the remaining sub-square into four sub-sub-squares.  Add one sub-sub-square to each of the three intact sub-squares.  Divide the remaining sub-sub-square into four sub^N-squares.  Continue the process until one of the remaining sub^N-squares is so small that you don't care if it isn't perfectly divided into thirds.
Which leftover pizza is stored best without a fridge?
If you get a Chicago-style deep-dish pizza with some toppings, especially onion, the likelihood that it'll start growing mold within a couple of days without a fridge is quite high.  Mold likes moisture, and onion is especially good at attracting mold (mushroom is itself the mold already).If you get a New-York-style thin crust cheese-only pizza, and keep it in the original carton box (don't use plastic!), it'll likely dry out within a couple of days, and then it'll probably be good for weeks, if stored in a well ventilated environment (e.g., in the pizza carton box).  The trick is that cheese itself has a lot of good bacteria, and it'll be a while before the bad mold bacteria starts growing in, especially if it's all dry and not moist.  The dry slices would be more alike crackers, though, but would be great as snacks!

How do I easily divide dough into thirds?
Why not using the simple fact that cos(60°) = 1/2?Put your dough in the form of a circle, make sure you know the centre point. From there you draw a horizontal line to the right, and in the middle of that line, you draw a perpendicular line up and down. Like this, you find two points, one above and one beneath. Together with the outmost left point of your circle, this forms the edges of the third parts you are looking for (I'm trying to find out how to attach a picture to this answer)

How to make my batteries work for a short time, one last time
I discovered the rubbing trick a while back.Did this with the batteries for a TV remote and they lasted an extra 6 months! Did it again today with my wireless mouse, still working hours later.I have done this with AA and AAA alkaline batteries.Hold the battery firmly at one end, then using your thumb and index finger of the other hand firmly rub the battery so you can feel a friction burn, do this all over the battery, I don't notice any difference in terms of what direction you rub. Do this strongly for about 5 minutes, should prolong their life significantly.Hope this helps in those last minute situations, or when you just can't be asked to go out to buy batteries.

Trim a little of the fat off the edge of the cut of meat and put that in the hot pan first.  Wipe it around to lubricate the pan, then put the meat in to fry.  If you don't have a knife handy, you could even just rub the fatty edge of the cut on the pan surface (though good luck eating the meat without a knife, unless it's a top quality cut).
How to quickly cure headaches without medicine
It is hard to recommend something specifically that will work for you but based on the information you gave, I think it is worth it to looking into trying out a pair of FL41 tinted glasses.Large number of people (including myself) suffer from migraines because of photophobia, blepharospasm, and any other light sensitivity "syndromes". We are just more likely to have eye strain due to certain light wavelengths.Tinted glasses help block these wavelengths and therefore, keep your migraine from starting in the first place. My migraines were always triggered at work (fluorescent lighting and computer screens) as well as on really sunny days. I tried out a pair of tinted glasses and it was almost instantaneous for them disappearing. Again, not sure if this is the case or trigger for you but it is an option you can explore.Note: If you do so though, make sure you get "real" FL41 glasses...I guess not all have the same tint density (source: https://www.axonoptics.com/migraine-causes/)
How best to prolong the shelf life of eggs?
Coating eggs in  mineral oil can also prevent the air/moisture exchange that David mentioned, but with out the exposure to the air inside a container. Note: Probably should have mentioned this, only use food grade mineral oil!
How do I avoid veggies going soft after freezing?
From my personal experience, if you boil the vegetables when they are still frozen, they turn out to be good and not soggy. Even the store bought frozen vegetables go soft after thawing them. I think the trick here is to cook them frozen instead of thawing it first, and not to over-cook it.
How best to prolong the shelf life of eggs?
The old classic method of preserving shell eggs for long periods without refrigeration was to dip the eggs in water glass (a solution of sodium silicate in water).  This would make the shells airtight, preventing oxidation and (most) bacterial growth, and allow shell eggs to keep for several weeks at room temperature.  Combined with refrigeration below 40 F after the water glass sets, this ought to keep eggs in Grade A condition for at least three months by preventing the drying that otherwise takes place in a refrigerator.BTW, this is the same effect as coating them with mineral oil, only the water glass can't soak through the shell and won't flavor the egg if a piece of shell gets into the contents when you break the shell.  Water glass is also a bit less permeable, so should last longer than oil coating.
How do I avoid veggies going soft after freezing?
Grocery store frozen vegetables thaw better because they're flash frozen with a process that creates smaller ice crystals that cause less damage.  Since there's no practical way to reproduce this in house, you have two options:Accept the veggies as-is and use them in ways in which the texture won't be a liability.  Soups, sauces, and rice dishes come to mind.Can the veggies, instead.  This is more work, but you'll end up with a better end result and a longer shelf life.
How can I reduce the chlorine smell on my skin after swimming?
I've found that if I take a fresh water shower immediately before going into a chlorine pool that it limits how much chlorine my skin and hair absorb. If I go straight into chlorine water with dry skin and hair it absorbs a lot more chlorine and it is a lot harder to get rid of the smell. 
How do I avoid veggies going soft after freezing?
I've never tried this with veggies, but I do it all the time with fish that I catch. Put the food in a water tight container, e.g. zip lock bag, and fill the remaining space with ice, water, and salt. The ice helps it freeze faster and the salt will draw some water out of the food. Both help prevent the cellular structure from breaking down.
How best to prolong the shelf life of eggs?
You could make some hard-boiled eggs, which last longer than regular ones. This depends on whether you enjoy your eggs hard-boiled or not though.
More efficient way to arrange a CD collection
easy way for me (1000cds):shelfes are 10 columns x 7 rows x ~20 cds in each compartmentfrom top to bottom roughly by genre (pop -> rock -> electronic -> hiphop), from left to right  roughly quiet to powerful, artist and bands with connecion stay together, whatever their name may be. so in the middle right is a place, where the white stripe stand next to the raconteurs, the dead weather, jack white, the kills and queens of the stone age.this system may not be the most obvious, but it works great for finding a special music in a mood. there is plenty of space in the shelfes, new bought cds mostly fit in easily.

I cleaned one wall of a friends house once which was covered in PVC Facia, and the only thing we used was a water high-pressure cleaner.  This worked like a charm, but do not have the beam too close to the panels as it might break it if it is old, fragile and crispy as these panels can be. 
Preventing socks from leaving marks on skin
Although, for a more left-field answer...If the elastic is still too tight for the rolling method described by James, you could always break the elastic and find an alternative way to hold your socks up.Staysput Irish Dancing Sock GlueSock Glue exists, and is intended mainly to hold up long (overknee) socks.  It's surprisingly widely used - from professional dancers to Japanese girls looking to maintain the "absolute territory" effect.It attests to being long-lasting, and apparently leaves no marks when washed off.
What is a good way to organise and identify keys on a keyring?
There are a lot of key organizing product on market. I use a Keysmart organizer to organize all my keys into a slim case. Other brands of similar products are available too if you just do a simple google search for key organizers. As to identify the keys, usually I arrange them in the order of most frequently used, but I think with this type of organizer, you can also use permanent marker or nail polish to  color code back side/the spine part of the keys as labels. This is their main website: http://getkeysmart.com
How to remove ice from windshield
I'm assuming keeping the car in a garage isn't an option, so . . .http://www.wikihow.com/De%E2%80%90ice-Your-WindshieldI like the rubbing alcohol and water solution (2-2) and the tip to put rubbing alcohol into the washer reservoir (3-3).  Going to try it this year rather than buying commercial solution.  Hopefully it will work as well as it does in the video I saw.  I'll do it with the heater/defrost on full blast to give it a little extra help.  
Listening to music in cubicle without headphones
To have speakers audible by you, and not others implies either that you have the volume turned down so that due to sound volume diminishing with distance it blends in before reaching others,  or use of active cancellation.However active cancellation requires to phase shift one of two channels,  and when done using speakers wave theory implies that at other spatial points the waves doubles instead of cancelling out... In short, no speaker arrangement are suitable for use in a cubicle environment without your neighbours accepting to hear your music. My best suggestion to you would be to invest in better headphones, possibly wireless, which are more comfortable to use over longer time periods. Alternatively have multiple headsets, i.e. some ordinary headphones and some ear buds to alternate between. Lastly, your ears/brain could most likely benefit from not listening to music the entire day, so having breaks not wearing headphones could do you good. 
Remove ink from coroplast
It depends on the type of ink. Some inks are soluble in alcohols, e.g. ethanol or  isopropanol (use at least 70% or stronger to try to remove the ink).Some inks are soluble in non-polar solvents, such as vegetable oil or paint thinner (flammable).Some inks can be removed with aromatic solvents, such as xylene and toluene, but though one can purchase them in hardware stores as varnish thinner, they are somewhat more hazardous to use and are likely to attack the Coroplast [polypropylene] substrate.So, depending on the the ink formulation, test the three types of solvent, above. Be aware that some ink dyes can soak into polypropylene and may be difficult to remove.
Listening to music in cubicle without headphones
It is possible to focus ultrasound so that non-linear effects make audible sound at the focal point. These speakers are used in retail advertisement, museums, libraries etc. where limiting the range of sound is important. So theoretically, it would be possible to have localized sound without headphones, but practically the sound is far from high fidelity and the equipment is expensive. It would be more practical to buy comfortable, open-back headphones that do not block external sound.
How to clean excess wax out of my ear
Hydrogen Peroxide is the active ingredient in OTC ear wax removal solutions. You will fill it "fizzing" but don't worry that's what it's supposed to do. Just keep your head to the side so the H2O2 has time to sit in your ear for a minute or two to break up the wax. P.S.   hydrogen peroxide is just water with an extra Oxygen molecule lightly attached 
Remove bad smell from clothes
Chances are it's due to bacteria on your clothes.While that sounds awful, keep in mind that all clothes will have various microbes living on them when you've worn them.Some bacteria are worse than others as far as generating smells go. If the problem persists, then your laundry routine isn't killing them. So...Ways to kill the germs.Use bleach. - Bleach is great for killing germs. Unfortunately, itcan also ruin clothes and irritate skin.Use a biological detergent. - Essentially the same science as usingbleach.Use a higher temperature wash. - There's a push for using lowertemperature washes.  While much kinder for the planet, unfortunatelythey kill far fewer germs. Also, your clothes might not appreciatethe higher temperature washes.Lastly my favourite, use an antibacterial spray. - Literally Dettol, orthe much cheaper supermarket alternatives.  Just spray onto theparts that smell (both inside and outside).Personally, I've used the last technique many times in the past.  It sometimes takes a couple of tries for a permanent result, but always works.  In any case, once the bacteria have been killed, the problem is fixed - you can wear the clothes as many times as you like afterwards.
Remove bad smell from clothes
Not drying wet clothes fast enough can cause a bad smell in them and it's hard to get it away. I would suggest re-wash them and put them in a dryer to dry them off thoroughly. If your clothes can't dry fast enough, there's nothing you can do during the process of washing will actually get rid of the smell. I like to hand wash my clothes and air dry them, therefore I encounter the same problem sometimes when the weather is bad and humid for a couple days straight. Here are my solutions:If you don't have access to a dryer, I would suggest getting a portable dehumidifier for your room to help your clothes dry faster. Winter's coming, if the place you live has furnace or heating vent, I would suggest hanging your clothes on a drying rack or something similar close to a heating source. That would help it dry a lot faster.If you live in a place with nice weather and a lot of sunny days, I would suggest taking it outside and hang it in your yard in the sun. This will dry it faster and at the same time kill all the bacteria. If you live in an apartment and not very convenient to take your clothes outside, you can put it closer to your window where sun comes in to have a similar effect.

Overall, I would try to wash your athletic clothes quickly, and not let them sit in the washing machine for a while. Other options:You could try upgrading your athletic clothes to a better fabric,and/or try to use a cotton/poly-blend, since cotton will breath more.I would not recommend putting athletic clothes in the dryer,especially if they have some type of elastic, because the heat candegrade the elastic over time. I would wash them, then let them dripdry. Make sure you remove your clothes from the washing machine promptly.Leaving them to sit in the machine can lead to bad smells. You can also try pre-washing, or hand-washing, your clothes andinclude some type of oxygenated detergent or baking-soda as anadditive to your regular detergent.

black ladies' stockings are a great look, even on a monitor. You may just be able to stretch one over the monitor, but if not you could cut one open and stretch it taut across the monitor and hold it in place with tape.The matt finish of the fabric absorbs sheen, but the fineness of the mesh allows the light from your monitor to pass through. It will reduce the brightness of your monitor so you may have to compensate by increasing the monitor's own brightness.

How can I prevent the remote control from getting lost?
I think you can try tie/glue/tape a piece of string to it and tie the other end somewhere near your couch, or wherever you sit to watch TV. If that dangles too much, maybe you can try fixing one of those retractable lanyard thing to your remote so it doesn't still end up at random places because it will retract to that one spot.

Attach a keyring finder to it.In general, avoid the whistle-activated ones, I find they're too sensitive and go off randomly.I'd probably go for one that doesn't use a remote, otherwise you're going to end up with a recursive problem.My favourite would probably be one activated by smart phone. Activated by button rather than by sound, and you can always ring your phone if you've misplaced that!How does one attach it to the remote? Depends how aesthetically pleasing and how technical you are. Least effort - duct tape, and plenty of it!Most effort - might involve removing the key parts of the finder and hiding them in the battery compartment. Some middle ground might double sided tape or similar.
How can I prevent the remote control from getting lost?
Rather than attaching something to the remote, make a place for it that is more attractive/easy to use:Various places sell sofa-side magazine holders, or trays. Have one of these on the most useful end of the sofa. Use tape to mark out a silhouette of the remote (or remotes, as many of us have) and tag it with the name of the remote.This should help encourage usage. To further help, why not gamify the process, with points for each member of the family who places the remote correctly or loses points for failing to do so. Top points at end of week wins a prize.
How can I prevent the remote control from getting lost?
I use self-sealing Velcro touch fasteners bands that I put on the back of the remote control and on the element it is related to (pedestal of the TV, body of the iPod docking station, table, etc).Then, this system only needs discipline to work : you take the remote control, you use it. Once you are finished, you put it back on the Velcro band.
Listening to music in cubicle without headphones
What I would most likely do in this situation would be this:DUCT TAPE a pair of wireless speakers to the back of your chair near your head.  Then you can connect your phone or computer or whatever and keep the volume low but close by.  You can get these speakers for pretty cheap online (like $40 for some models).  Alternatively you can use an old pair of computer speakers, but then you have to worry about cords and you can't spin in your chair.Honestly if I were you I would either turn up the volume and let my coworkers worry about themselves, or DUCT TAPE some speakers to my chair.  Really, DUCT TAPE fixes everything (even a light bulb, but I won't go into that).
How do I avoid veggies going soft after freezing?
I'm not speaking from personal experience here, but I have heard that if you put a bag of dry ice next to them in the freezer they will come out no problem.  I assume that it's the flash freezing that makes that work.  This is the same trick, I believe, that game hunters use to keep venison.
How to make an ethernet cable with a broken clip usable?
As usual, my answer involves DUCT TAPE!Take a small piece of DUCT TAPE and place it over the top side of the connector on the side where the clip would be.  Repeat until you have built up enough material so that it goes in and stays in.Honestly though, these cables are so cheap you should just buy a new one, or reterminate it (but that's way more expensive unless you know someone with the tools).  Alternatively you could just ship it to me and let me reterminate it for you...
How can I get a head-phone plug out of the jack?
Really your best bet is open heart surgery on the machine.  There's a slim chance that the jack is open-backed and you can push it out from the inside.I've done this before, it's pretty easy.  You just have to make sure you know how to take apart a computer and put it back together.
How can I prevent the remote control from getting lost?
Your main problem seems to be that you're the only one with a bit of discipline, and you're the only one who wants to put it in a given place. In other words, the issue is much more than just having a good place to put your remote control.You either need to train other members of your household to return it/place it somewhere, or you need to work around the problem and be able to relocate it when they've misplaced it.In my experience both cases are hard, as it is not easy to train/force those who don't want to be trained. Best option related to training is to invent/enforce a system which they'll see as a benefit without any extra work for them. It could work to have a given place, which is close to the favourite position for using the remote control.On the other hand, finding it when it is misplaced requires some sort of locating device, such as key ring finders, or attaching strings or other large objects (makes it impractical to move it :-) ).Overall, I would say that your best option is either to talk to your household members and see about finding a really good place to put it, and/or for you to consider if you can control the equipment by other means so you don't have to find it when the others have misplaced it. The latter one can be achieved by having an extra universal remote control for your use, or having a remote control app on your smartphone, if that is possible with your equipment.
How can I prevent the remote control from getting lost?
Some smart phones have infrared transmitters that can directly control TV (and other remote controlled entertainment equipment).  My Samsung Galaxy S4 does this; with the correct app it'll do anything the cable company's universal remote will.  Even better, with a Samsung TV, I have access through wifi to play content from the phone on the TV and access the smart TV with the phone as a control pad, which is much nicer to use than the TV remote.
How can I prevent the remote control from getting lost?
Maybe you could attach the remote to something big so that it's easier to find if it gets lost.
Cleaning Narrow Spaces in Kitchen
I can only think of two things which will fit in such a narrow gap - a bamboo cane (the sort of thing used to support plants in the garden) and, even narrower, a yardstick (http://www.amazon.com/Westcott-10420-Wood-Yardstick-36/dp/B00112U3JY). Bamboo canes vary in thickness though, and some of the longer ones are really quite thick, so you'd need to select one the right length and width. Yardsticks are usually only 3 feet long, so although it would fit in the gap quite well, it won't be long enough to reach right to the back. Either way, you have to wrap them in some sort of fabric - I use old pillowcases or large teeshirts, cut up, wrapped tightly round the stick, tied or stitched lightly in place at the top, insert and draw out several times to try to remove loose stuff initially. Then wet the material and cover with a cleaning product such as Mr. Muscle kitchen or whatever, then reinsert and draw out several times. If you've used a bamboo cane, it might be possible to rotate it in the gap, which does a better job of cleaning. It's not perfect as a solution, but it does a reasonable job with a bit of effort.Long term, it's probably sensible to fix wooden battens between the two counters and your oven to prevent stuff falling down there in the first place, if at all possible.

There has been no problem laying them flat on the top rack of a dishwasher. The water spray may move them around, or rarely fold them over so rewashing is needed, but no harm is done.
Controlling mold mites
It is better to eliminate the mold than to try to kill the mites. This avoids use of dangerous pesticides the likelihood of the mites recurring.To reduce mold,Reduce humidity, either with ventilation, a dehumidifier or absorbent such as calcium chloride.Remove anything the mold eats, e.g. old papers or food. Vacuum thoroughly.If mold is a problem in a specific area, it can be temporarily removed with chlorine bleach or CO2 blasting. If the conditions causing mold are not fixed, the mold can be expected to return.See more on mold removal at Family Handyman.You might try garden miticides, but they may have health dangers.
Remove and restore stickers from back of laptop
Since most of them are made of a semi-plastic material, the safest way is by using a hairdryer. Start heating from the corners of the sticker.Apply heat for 45 seconds and try to peel it. If it's coming off smoothly, keep going; if not, apply another 45 seconds of heat.Rinse and repeat and they'll be off!Soaking them a little could help the process, but being a laptop, water might not be a good thing to put near it, so use nail polish remover instead (a non-flammable one). Olive oil (actually any type of greasy oil) can help remove the glue after the sticker is off.

How to keep colour in clothes?
Washing in cold water should work. I wash all delicate or color bleeding clothing in cold water. Please make sure to also separate those from other clothing/light colored jeans so in case it bleeds, it doesn't bleed the color on other stuff. 
How to keep colour in clothes?
If you're convinced the vinegar rinse works, yes, you're supposed to use it every time, in the last rinse, and it has to be white vinegar. I never found it made any difference though - if your jeans are indigo dyed, then they 'bleed' every time you wash them, and when they're new, the colour bleeds or transfers onto pale furniture and carpets if you sit on them.Definitely turn them inside out every time before washing, always do up the buttons and zipper, use cold water for the whole wash unless they're particularly dirty, do use a liquid wash intended for dark clothing, don't dry them in direct sunlight - this helps to keep the colour for longer. If your jeans aren't fashionably 'patchy', with paler areas for aesthetic effect, you can buy an indigo jeans dye and re dye them when they get particularly faded.http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dylon-350-Machine-Dye-Salt/dp/B00UJGOJYI/ref=dp_ob_title_kitchenThe results from using this aren't quite the same as brand new jeans though.

Remove and restore stickers from back of laptop
I used to work the service desk at Kohl's. When items too large to fit into a bag were purchased, we'd attach a large sticker to the item at checkout so security could know it wasn't stolen. At the service desk we had a special spray for when those items were returned - spray it liberally onto the sticker, wait 5-10 minutes, then the sticker would easily peel off, without taking the top layer of the box with it (thus preserving the "new" look of the packaging). If we didn't use enough, or if we waited too long/not long enough, it was less effective. The stickers, after being removed and allowed to dry, could have been reused (though we didn't do so, for lack of a place to keep them nor sufficient need).Unfortunately, I don't remember what the product was called, but I think something like this might work, as long as you remove the stickers carefully, and then let them dry before applying them to the new laptop.

How to get combat boots shined to mirror finish?
As a former cadet pilot in the French Air Force, my class and I used to set fire to the polish in its box, then quickly put the lid back on it to put out the fire. We then used a regular rag to polish the boots, then the special trick was to use stockings, "borrowed" to the only girl of the class, stretching them with two hands, then polishing the boots with it, without adding anymore polish.As English is not my native language, I have trouble explaining it, so feel free to ask more explanations.
Cleaning Narrow Spaces in Kitchen
Assuming this is an electric oven, sliding it out from between the two side counters makes it trivial to clean both the counter and oven sides. Make sure to protect the floor from the sliding feet of the oven; squares of cardboard generally work well (as long as you make sure they move with the feet).If you have a gas oven I wouldn't recommend this, as life could get very entertaining without much warning.

How to prevent my earphones from falling out when I wear the helmet?
A quick fix that wouldn't take up more room in your helmet could be to wrap a rubber band around your head at ear level, pushing the speakers into the lug in your ear. For everyday use without a helmet you could do the same with a headband maybe? As a rubber band may not be comfortable for long periods. I use a headband when running, I run the cable through the top and out the bottom of the headband so if something tugs on the wires the earphones don't get pulled out of my ears.
Cleaning Narrow Spaces in Kitchen
If you have a spare wire coat hanger handy, you could straighten it out into a long thin pole and wrap some cloth around it tightly (enough for it not to fall off, but not too much so that it doesn't fit in the gap).Then use an in, wipe across, then out motion to get all the bits that are not reachable by hand. I use this technique for cleaning down the back of my wall-mounted radiators as the gaps are too narrow for my hands. Hope this helps.
How to hard-boil an egg in the microwave safely?
I found simply covering the eggs completely in a mug and adding a tablespoon of salt to the water prevented any explosions. Ran the microwave on full for ten minutes, took it out and sat it for two minutes. Transferred to a bowl of cold water for another two minutes and then shelled it. Perfect hard-boiled egg with no grey ring. :) 
Vinyl Above Ground Pool - can't find leak - will renting a compressor work?
I don't think it's feasible to rent a small compressor and blow against the outside of your pool. The air will go the easiest way and that is not through the body of water within the pool. If you should use air, you would need to flip it around so that the air could escape through water. Like in actually flipping the pool around and submerging it into a larger pool, partially filling it with water, and then see where the air flows out of your pool. Not easily done, though.Assuming your leak is in the actual bottom, it could be an option to cover the bottom area with ordinary towels (between the vinyl cover and the pool), fill it up and let it stand for a while allowing some water to leak. If you then drain the pool, and carefully lift aside the bottom you should be able to locate the wet towel and find the leaky area. That would narrow your search down to a smaller area.When finding the leaky area, you could try to further narrow it down by tapeing paper towels to the bottom of the pool in that area, and then refill that area with colored water. The leak should then be visible and easy to locate after just a few minutes with water in that area of the pool.Disclaimer: I haven't actually tested these ideas, but in theory they should work! Hope it helps!

Best way to know if somebody has broken into my room without camera
I've seen some people close little slips of paper in the doorframe (hinge and/or handle sides) that would fall when the door is opened, and/or stack boxes against the outside of the door in what appears to be somewhat random fashion but where the edges and corners line up with pen or other markings in a particular way, and compare before vs. after pictures.  Edit: The above is the low-tech solution.  Logging door sensors and/or a motion activated camera are higher-tech solutions that should not be overlooked by someone who arrives at this question/answer looking for similar ideas.

Install door sensors. These work similar to the ones on a garage door, but you can buy them for interior man-doors. Some of them are very inconspicuous.Wire it up to a Raspberry Pi or another device that can record when the door was opened and save it to a log. There may even be ready-made products that do all of this, but my inner geek would want to wire it up and program it myself.When you return, simply check the log and make sure there are no unexplained log entries (i.e. nothing between when you left and when you returned).If you cannot trust your roommates, a better option might be to move.

How to prevent my earphones from falling out when I wear the helmet?
As @PoolPartyRenekton said, you first of all need to get earphones that actually fit your ears well (or ear buds). That said in the mean time you can try to pad your existing earbuds with the cloth covers you mentioned, to see if that makes a better fit.In terms of wearing earphones with a helmet, When I used to wear headphones in a helmet, I found that they came out when I put on my helmet because the helmet would pull the cord down. To counter this, I bunched up some slack near the ear bud before putting on my helmet. You can also try wrapping the cord over and behind your ear, so its harder for them to be pulled out when you put on your helmet. Also, be sure to pull the chin strap as far apart as you can when putting on the helmet, to give your head/ears as much clearance as possible when putting on the helmet. If all else fails, get a bluetooth headset. I got a Sena headset, and highly recommend everybody who rides consistently to get one. 
Best way to know if somebody has broken into my room without camera
Stick gum on several spots like light switch, door knob, drawer etc., whereever you think the intruder might touch. Take a picture of the gum. When you return, if there is a finger print or if the gum is in different shape to that of your picture then someone has touched it. You know what that means, then, don't you? With my approach, you not only can say if someone has broken in but you also MAY have their finger prints. If they manage to remove the gum to protect their identity, you at least would have managed to gross them out. haha
Best way to know if somebody has broken into my room without camera
It's a variation on the existing answers, but perhaps a worthwhile one.Attach a short piece of string to the top of the door frame, towards the handle side (as opposed to the hinge side). It should be short enough that it's likely to go unnoticed, and it should ideally be the same color as the door.When you close the door, place the string so it goes over the top of the door into your room.If someone opens the door, the string will hang straight down, and when they close the door, it will be pushed to where it's visible from the outside. When you return, before opening the door, check if the string is sticking out. If it is, someone has been in the room.

Besides obvious answers about Books, paper, hairs and stuff like using half of a toothpick... Have you considered getting a simple alarm system instead of relying on cheap tricks? I use SimpiSafe at home. Granted at $259 for The 7 piece start package, it's going to be more expensive than hair, a tooth pick or a bag of flour... At the end of it you'll have an actual alarm system:No yearly agreement$15-25 a month depending on options chosenNo reliance on local internet - alerts happen via cell phone networkRead: Works with loss of internetBattery powered parts - including battery backup in the base unit. Read: Works with loss of powerAlerts on any status changeRead: Someone trips the motion sensor? Turns off the alarm system? Opens a window?Change different sensors to silently alertChange different sensors to alert local authorities (or, in this case, most likely not)Useful when you leave for work - not just when you are on vacation/leaveApplied via small screws/tape. no need for complicated installs.Adjustable - get enough for one room... or expand to a householdIf you don't like SimpliSafe, other options exist - all with their own pros and cons... The main point to consider is a REAL alarm system - even if for a single room. Just because you trust your roommates, don't mean that you trust their friends/family.

Having proper fitting headphones is really going to be the least aggravating in my experience. But in the event you want to be warmer, can squeeze a few millimeters in your helmet, and keep earbuds secure, check out the 360 earmuffs.
Best way to know if somebody has broken into my room without camera
Draw the blinds so the room is dark, and wire up some kind of energy usage meter to the lighting circuit.
Best way to know if somebody has broken into my room without camera
My first answer would have been to tamper-proof the door as well, but I like this one too:Fill up a large bowl with an assortment of candy and leave it in your room.  While the contents of the bowl look random and uncounted, you have, in fact, counted it's contents.  To enhance the plot, share the candy with your roommates before you leave.  Let them know that there is a huge bowl of candy in your possession.And in the spirit of Jimmy Hoffa's answer, poison the candy.
How to reform dent on hair due to long usage of head-phones?
Wear your headphones at the front of your hair, where the headphones normally don't get near the back of your hair. Put it closer to your forehead.Also, try to LOOSEN your headphones. If none of these are working, just wear a hat or use earbuds.
Packing for short trip
In my experience your best approach is to buy a set of packing cubes. These are just mesh bags that don't look like they do anything:They aren't airtight and you don't squish down on them as you pack or anything like that. But still, they let you take far more and stay organized and clean. Say you take the medium cube, and you put into it two folded shirts. It looks full, but you put a third shirt on top and it fits. Strange. So you put a fourth shirt and it also fits. And a fifth. You're not deliberately compressing but stuff just fits.Then you take a smaller cube and you put your socks, underwear and such in it. The same thing happens, it seems you can always fit more. The advantages of the cubes are:it's easy to unpack at the other end. Just put the "underwear cube" on a shelf or in a drawer, the "shirts cube" the same (if you don't hang up your shirts) and so on.the clothes are protected from any dirt in the bag from other usesit's easy to find things since you're not rooting around in the whole bagand most importantly, you can fit far more in the same bag than you could without the cubes.You may find you can fit 6 days worth into the small backpack. I fit 5 weeks worth into a bag that is small enough to be an airplane carryon.(It wasn't 35 outfits though, I did laundry on the trip.) In the same bag I also have done a 9 day trip with business and casual clothes, so 11 outfits plus swimsuit, sunhat and warm sweater. The cubes made the difference.
Best way to know if somebody has broken into my room without camera
As many people have seen Death note animation series so I am just taking about that scenario where he comes to know that someone has break his room and tried to come in. In chapter 16 of Death note manga there is situation when Ryuzaki comes to know that someone has tried to enter his room. But the fun part is how he did that .It's great if you will read those images which I have attached to this answer it will help you for better understanding.If you hate reading it try seeing this video:Here is the link of death note series Episode 8 and if you will start seeing it from 10:00 then you will see the whole explanation about how he comes to know that someone has tried to come in his room.Written explanation:At first he sets one little paper trap on his door which he used as decoy.The second trap was that the handle of his door. He purposely lowers the handle of the door by 5 millimeter while he goes out of his room but most of them don't notice this so if someone may have break his room then he will notice that the handle will go straight horizontally. The third one is the pencil lead which he used to attach with metal hinges of the door.Whenever he used to close the door he put one piece of lead above the hinges and when someone tries to open the door the leads gets crushed but he usually pull the lead out before he open the door but then if someone will try to open it then it will break easily.Advantage:3 levels of security which anyone can apply. You don't need anything which is too costly because the things which were used in this scenario is really common.You can implement your own ideas on this whole plan by putting anything else.Never ending, you can use this again and again without any waste of money (except that pencil lead)Many people see that paper trap because its quite common now days and they get happy that they have identified that trap and then they try to put it back if they are trying to go into your room but most of them don't even think that there can be even second trap and they neglect that part which increase the chances that your plan will work and even if someone will come to know about the second trap which is quite rare or if by the way the second trap fail to work according to plan then you will have one last trap there which will not fail.Disadvantage:The success rate for this scenario is quite high but still there are chances that if someone may know all these tricks.Images taken from Death note manga series:Chaper 16: Page 14Chaper 16: Page 15Chaper 16: Page 16URL for these images are :http://www.mangatown.com/manga/death_note/v02/c016/14.htmlhttp://www.mangatown.com/manga/death_note/v02/c016/15.htmlhttp://www.mangatown.com/manga/death_note/v02/c016/16.html
How to reform dent on hair due to long usage of head-phones?
This happens to me ALL of the time. The easiest and most effective way to remove the hair dents is to loosen it by applying warm water to your hair, it works like an iron with clothes, the heat loosens up the hair and allows it to fall back into normal shape.I do this pretty much every night, works every time...I also have large ear style headphones that cover your ear, this causes hair around my ears to flatten and look odd along with the band going across my head.This trick will also help you in the morning if you get bed head, try it and see for yourself.This trick will fix all of those issues, quick and easy without modifying the way you wear headphones etc...
How to remove mildew from leather shoe
It seems more likely that they are salt marks, and can rather easily be removed by using a combination of water and vinegar. If unsure on how to do this you could do a google search for remove white marks on tan leather shoe. The general procedure is:Mix equal parts of white vinegar and waterUse a clean rag to wipe away the salt. May need to be repeatedUse another rag with only water to wipe away the vinegarLet everything dry again, and hopefully your stain is removedThere are also chemical salt cleaners available for purchase, in which case you would follow the procedure on the product.
Packing for short trip
I recently read and viewed some videos about ranger roll, which I found somewhat fascinating. In the really extreme example for a day or two trip you could do:Lay down an extra t-shirt on a table, fold in the sleeves and a little bit of the side of the shirt in towards the middleAdd an extra pair of underwear in the middlePut an extra pair of socks close to the neck of the t-shirt:Take the left sock and put the toe close to the right side, so that the top extends out on the left sideTake the right sock and the toe close to the left side, so that the  top extends out on the right sideIf so inclined, add a tooth brush into the bundleRoll it up, and you should have a roll approximate the width of a legWrap both socks back onto the rollThe above procedure is not exactly a ranger roll, but it makes a neat little bundle you can throw into your back pack, and you'll have most of what you need for a day or two.The proper ranger roll use the garment itself to wrap around the roll, and can be described as the following:Lay down your t-shirt on the tableMake a lip/fold/crease on the bottom part, that is turn it inside out all around the bottom part for a 5-6 cm (a few inches)Fold in the left side towards the center (optionally fold the sleeve back again over the center), and repeat for the right sideStarting rolling tightly from the neck/collar all the way down to the bottomWrap the lip around the roll, and this should hold the entire thing together neatlySorry, if my explanation is not clear enough, but the gist of the idea is to roll the garments into rolls which self-lock (either by using a sock as in the first example, or the garment it self doing a proper ranger roll). You now have a few rolls, which you easily can fit into whatever back pack you choose to use.Regarding back pack, I would go as small as possible, and I had one with a laptop compartment in the back, and a few large rooms in front of that. That way I could have the laptop in the back, all clothes in the first large room, and then all the tidbits (music player, wallet, keys, a little food, and so on) in the front compartment.
How can I dim the 20+ LEDs that are in my room to help with sleep?
Two immediate thoughts comes to mind: 1) Move the equipment out of the room, 2) Improve on your dimming idea.  Assuming it's not an option to move the equipment out of the room, I'll suggest some other options to dim the lights.Use thicker not so semi-transparent tape – Depending on whether you at any time need to see the lights or not, you could opt for black electrical tape, or multiple layer of semi-transparent tape, or a colored tape which would limit the transmitted lightTurn the equipment around – Direct light is worse than indirect light, so if it is an option to turn the equipment around somehow, so that you don't face the lights directly, that would be betterUse hot glue on top of the lights – Hot glue is a dark variant off semi-transparent, and if done properly it will just be a little extra bulb on top of the other light. Especially for some LED diodes this could be a viable solution. Do however take into consideration, that this might violate your warranty, and is somewhat more permanent than using tapeUse an automated timer to shut off equipment at night – Most likely you are not going to use most of the equipment at night, so don't rule out shutting them down during the night time. This can be done using an automatic timer (or a remote control timer), or possilby a master-slave power outlet. 
How to clean excess wax out of my ear
My husband's ears produce a lot of wax and, as told by his doctor, he adds a couple of olive oil drops in his ears once a week. I usually perform the task with a teaspoon (well clean). We know the drop is inside because he can feel it. I do mess up from time to time, it is not a problem, just clean it with a tissue. He is able to add the oil drops with the teaspoon by himself if I am not at home, just practice.Good luck, you are not alone.
How to remove printed labels from the backing easily?
Take a piece of sticky tape and put it on one corner of the backing paper, to give you a bit of a handle to hold the backing paper with. Press it on hard to get it to stick well.Now roll the label off the backing paper, concentrating on getting the very corner of the sticker to peel off. Once the corner is loose, the rest of the sticker will follow easily.
How to get rid of dandruff from hairs?
I believe your main problem is your hair and scalp being too dry after cleaning. My skin and hair also remain very dry during winter. Here are some solutions-One natural solution:Use avocado oil/argan oil to comb/brush through your hair, and maybe massage some on your scalp to keep everything nourished and moisturized. Other solutions:Use conditioner after washing your hair. If you are not used to using conditioner before, it might take a few times to figure out how much to put on (or which brand to use) for best result. Use moisturizing shampoo/conditioner. You might or might not have significant improvement on your problem depending if it works well with your hair. Get some leave-in conditioner to put on after you get out of shower. There are moisturizing sprays available too if you feel that's more convenient than rubbing things onto your hair. Like I said, if you don't already have a habit of putting stuff on your hair, it might take a few tries to figure out what works best for you. Hope this helps! :D
Plucking a chicken without a machine
I also am a shochet. I have always taken off the skin in order to avoid the issue, but I was recently told a trick a hunter i know uses and that is to refrigerate the bird- get it down below 30F I understand  the feathers come off very easily then- not as well as scalding but the skin doesn't tear...
Flatten Bumpy Stickers After Heated
Use something to hammer them flat. It won't damage the stickers ( as you requested) , but I can't say the same for the laptop.
Flatten Bumpy Stickers After Heated
Use a credit card when applying. Sort of scrape it flat, with a fair bit of pressure so no air is trapped underneath.If the sticker is already placed, you should probably re-stick them. Or try scraping it flat, because you have to remove the air. But don't force the bubbles or lumps if they are stubborn as you may stretch or rip it.I just thought, you could use your hairdryer, while flattening the sticker with a credit card, to melt the glue a bit.

How to tie a tie?
Many ways to tie a tie. The "simplest" tie knot imo would be the 4 in hand knot. They're not recommended on spread collared shirts because the finished knot isnt wide like the full windsor. Great resource here: http://www.ties.com/how-to-tie-a-tie/four-in-hand
How to clean inside of straw

How to de-scuff patent leather shoes
Nail polish remover or Rubbing Alcohol works!. Apply a little nail polish remover or Rubbing Alcohol to a cotton ball to polish out the scuff marks. Then, apply baby powder or petroleum jelly, like Vaseline, to protect the shoe's material. This method works well for Patent Leather.
How can I repair these glasses?
You can use cyanoacrylate glue to fit the "glass" back together. The bond will probably not be as strong as the original if it is glass.Follow the instructions on the glue bottle for the best results.A lot of glass lens are made from some type of plastic material. Glues can damage the lens in those cases.The only good repair is to replace the lenses.
How to steep but separate leaves in a teapot without a mesh strainer?
Rather than using a strainer built into your teapot, use an external strainer. Allow the hot water and loose tea leaves to hang out in your pot, then pour through the strainer into your cup.This one costs $4 Cdn on amazon.ca. I'm sure you can find plenty in that price range. Slightly more expensive ones come with a little bowl to set them down in so as not to dribble on a counter.
How to steep but separate leaves in a teapot without a mesh strainer?
Getting a french press for coffee works very well with this. You don't have to press the leaves down at first if you feel like letting them float for longer. Then it's up to you when you want to press the leaves down. It's also extremely easy to clean, and you don't need to make special tea bags or anything that will need to be thrown away after each use. 
How to make sun view glasses from home supplies
Some reflective coated polyester wrap ("mylar") has a metallic coating thin enough to faintly see light through.  If you can just barely make out a bright light bulb through a single layer, it's as dark as the recommended welding filter.Failing that, make a small pinhole in a sheet of opaque material, and use it to project a solar image on a piece of white paper.  This image can be viewed safely in either an eclipse, or when the sun is unobscured (as for counting sunspots -- possible with the right setup and enough projection distance).
How to remove snow from a roof
"Avalanche" makes a roof rake with a slide attached to it to eliminate the need to pull the snow off–you simply push the tool under the snow, and gravity takes care of the rest. You could certainly devise a DIY version of this using some sheet metal and plastic sheeting as shown in this gif: https://i.imgur.com/pvqyEhi.gifv
How can I repair these glasses?
My glue of choice for projects like this is a quick set (5 Minute) Epoxy.  Since the break is not in the line of vision, the repair should not effect functionality.  I'd first carefully repair the breaks one at a time, and then after it has cured for an hour or so, I'd place a reinforcement along the top and epoxy it in (anything from a metal brad to a tooth pick) would do --- cover it with a generous amount of epoxy & let it all set for several hours before using the glasses.  Be careful to avoid finger prints from sticking to the glass, perhaps coating just non-glued sections with a light coat of vasoline or soap.  
How can I automatically open my chicken coop door in the morning?
Since you do not worry that the chickens will be outside when you choose to have the door closed, as they are most likely inside already I have one suggestion to you: An automatic trap door.If you make a sliding door which can be hoisted upwards, then  you can have an active lifting mechanism to lift it in the morning, and release it down again in the evening (or automatically drop if power fails). This will also spare you the trouble of making sure it is properly shut, as gravity will keep it shut, and you can lift it a suitable amount using some electric motor.Such devices can surely be bought, but should not be to hard to build if you are somewhat handy yourself. Depending on needs and wants, you can choose whether to make it fully automatic or if you want to have some remote control for it. Both are feasible, although not easily described within a post like this.One option springing to mind is to have a timer giving power to a lifting circuit which would spin an engine lifting the door until it touches a circuit breaker when lifted high enough, but not releasing the tension on the spinning device until power is shut off (by the automatic timer).
How can I automatically open my chicken coop door in the morning?
You can use some kind of controller to automate this task. For example Arduino. But you need some programming experience to do this. You will need an electric motor which will move the door in both directions (open/close). And some sensors (like Hall effect sensor) which will detect if the door is closed or opened.The door can be controlled with a timer or a sensor (photo resistor/transistors) which detects if it is day or night (depending on the light).
Working with acrilyc/plexiglass
It depends on what you are trying to do. An electric heat gun creates a broad heating area, so unless you are trying to dimple the plastic, that probably will not work well anyway.Strip heaters heat to about 280F to do angle bends, so essentially any electric indirect infrared source (i.e. no gas, no direct flames or direct contact with hot surfaces) will work in a pinch. The forming temperatures are usually around 270-290F depending on material. Quick note of caution: Overheated acrylics can give off dangerous gases when heated above certain temperatures, so appliances used in a kitchen setting are not generally recommended. Outdoor or well-ventilated area only, so if you understand that, then…The heating rod from an electric BBQ starter can be used for certain types of angular bends, as long as the material is narrow enough to be heated evenly along its width. A toaster oven can be used for smaller pieces if you want the entire piece heated. Built-in oven thermostats are notoriously inaccurate, so start at a low temperature (250 F?) and heat it slowly until pliable. Use an external thermometer if you have it and don't over heat it. If the material is thin and narrow enough, you might even try holding it over a high-wattage light bulb. It wont give you any type of precision for where exactly it will be heated, but depending on your application, that level of precision may not be needed.Even an electric hair dryer can work in some applications; same caveats as above, but the material has to be thin enough for any of these applications so not to scorch the surface before the interior is heated. Low and slow is the key.
How to remove sticky color from iron box
I suggest using Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). When the iron is slightly hot, put some baking soda on a piece of wet cotton and rub the surface. I tried it before and it worked.
How can I repair these glasses?
You can buy a cheap glasses which has the most appropriate framing for the lenses you have. And then try to place those lenses on the new frame.After finding a cheap frame like in the picture below, you can even get your lenses re-shaped / re-formed by an expert. Maybe you can try it on your own to round the corners using sandpaper. 
How can I repair these glasses?
Most lenses are made of plastics chemically similar to acrylic or polycarbonate.  That means they can be "welded" with solvent glues that work on those plastics -- Ambroid ProWeld is the brand on the bottle I have at home.  Exercise extreme care, as the solvent will cause either surface distortion of frosting if it gets on the surface of the lens -- hold the lenses upside down so drips run off instead of into the field of view, and coat areas away from the joint with oil or grease to protect the surface.Follow the instructions on the bottle -- usually, you'll dry join the pieces and apply the tiniest possible drop of solvent to the joint where it runs to the edge of the lens.  Done carefully, this can produce a nearly invisible join as strong as the original, unbroken material -- and unlike other types of glue, won'tn preclude gluing with another adhesive if it doesn't work; the solvent will evaporate cleanly.
How can I automatically open my chicken coop door in the morning?
Build a door similar to this on the picture below;It is similar to the small doors for pets found on exterior house doors. I am not sure if the chickens will push the door with their heads to enter inside or go out. If this is the case, then you can put a sensor and a second stepper motor to open and close the door. Don't forget to wire the sensor also to the timer.I bought one of this timers to use with my boiler. They are around 15-20$ on aliexpress. For the stepper motors, look inside of the old CD/DVD ROMs or Scanner / Printers. I don't think they are expensive. I think you can find sensors online. They must be cheap on sites like ebay or aliexpress.Note: You may ask how to limit the rotation to 180*. Well, it may be done by setting the speed of the motor. The timer is not second-sensitive. The minimum time range between the On and Off is 1 minute. So the door should complete the 180* rotation in one minute. I know it is not easy to do without using electronics.
How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?
Just grab your pillow and wait... When the buzzing sound in your ears alert you, bam! Hit yourself with the pillow. The large area of impact will crush it. 
How can I prevent the remote control from getting lost?
I'd say the best answer to this problem is to buy another, identical remote for your use.Keep it locked, or hidden away. If the rest of the household loses their remote, it's their problem. They will soon miss you finding it for them, and maybe they will then learn amongst themselves to place the remote in a designated spot when not in use.
Best way to clean formica.Table has turned dark in places from the sun

How to dry out a wet backpack
I've put mine in the dryer on regular occasions without damaging it.  You need to use gentle setting (low-medium heat) and limit the amount of time tumbling around.  For extra protection, put it in a pillow case or other fabric enclosure to reduce the beating/scratching against the dryer inside.
Working with acrilyc/plexiglass
I recall doing some plastic bending in shop class years ago and the pieces were put in a small oven (not toaster).  If I recall it was @350F.   With oven gloves you can test the malleability regularly until you reach the point where you can easily mold it to you desired shape.@Robert Cartaino raises important points about burning/toxic gases.  According the Wikipedias https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate), the melting temperature is 320F, so I agree with aiming low until you reach a point where it can be bent.
Turning my desk's smile upside down
A single table leg might be too rickety; the cross section is too small. But if you use a 10" or 12" wide board, standing on end directly under the monitor's base, I think that would do the trick! You can stand it up parallel to the sides of the desk, or parallel to the front & back of the desk. Just make sure it's exactly the height of the trestles.
How to dry out a wet backpack
I bike ride quite a bit and personally use a dryer rack when drying items in the dryer (shoes, backpacks etc) etc) anything that you do not want tumbling around can be dried on a dryer rackThey are called 'Dryer Racks' Look online for one thats compatible with your dryer brand. If you have a auto moisture sensing dryer, just place it on that setting and set it & forget it. I do this about 3 times a month with NO issues at all... Hope that helps!
Turning my desk's smile upside down
You can move the monitor so as it stays right above another leg, though, depending on the construction of the leg, it may be not enough place for your legs.Personally I also have a deck, but mine monitor is attached to the wall via the "robo arm".
Turning my desk's smile upside down
Whilst the best option would be to add cross bars across the entire length above the trestle legs, you could also opt for stiffening the particleboard table top in between the legs.This can be done by attaching a board along the back edge of the table. The higher the board the better. Something like a 2.5cm x 7.5cm (2'' x 3'') should suffice, and be easy enough to fasten through the table with multiple screws. (Note that higher part should go downwards, as in the beautiful ascii art below which is viewed from the side of desk) TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT  T - Table top                            B                            B      B - Support beam(+1 for ascii art)          BSuch an extra support beam will stiffen the table top a lot, and I've used this often to stiffen either tables tops or shelves.
How to dry out a wet backpack
For all (backpack, shoes, jacket) I use electric fan which blows warm air at them and highly decreases the time for drying. It is something like a heater with fan and I set it to lowest temperature. Depending on the material of your backpack/shoes/jacket you can use higher temperatures.Some other things you can do to dry them faster:Backpack: Hang it somewhere upside down so that any water comes out easily. after that put a dry towel inside for some time. Then take it out and open all the zippers and everything that can be opened. And hang it somewhere. Shoes: Put a towel inside them to take out the water. After some time  change it with another dry towel or old newspapers.
How to effectively and regularly clean 1200sqft of carpet?
If you would like to invest in another vacuum, I suggest getting a robot vacuum. I personally own a Neato Botvac D75. There are other models too, some specifically good at collecting hair. According to the specs, it cleans on average 2000 sq feet. It doesn't need to be supervised and can return to docking station after done with the room. Another brand is Roomba. I got Neato because it has a planned path rather than going random directions, but if you are interested, you can go to their websites to compare and see which one you prefer. Robot vacuums can be scheduled to automatically start cleaning on a regular basis. Therefore if you decide to invest in one, you will be hands free and have your carpet vacuumed every day. 
How to effectively and regularly clean 1200sqft of carpet?
You need to use another vacuum cleaner, switch between the two vacuum cleaners when one of them is overheating. And if it overheats take the other one and continue.  Or simply find a vacuum cleaner which doesn't overheat, I never had overheating problems.About the problem with the brush which collects a lot of hair - this kind of bush is not suitable for homes where live people with long hair (or animals) maybe you have to try another one if you vacuum cleaner allows brush changing.
How to effectively and regularly clean 1200sqft of carpet?
You could do a first pass with a stiff broom.  You can effectively sweep carpet and once the bulk of the hair is removed, follow with the vacuum.  Because it starts cleaner, the vacuum should be on for longer and not have to work as hard.
What is a cost effective way to eliminate heat loss through windows?
The old standby for this was "temporary storm windows", for houses that lacked custom-fitted storm windows.A storm window overlays the window frame on the outside to prevent exterior air (along with rain, snow, etc.) from directly contacting the single-pane sashes; it provides some insulation (less effective than modern multipane glass, but much better than nothing), as well as physical protection (storm windows were often shatterproof acrylic plastic).Temporary storm windows are a simple clear plastic sheet (plastic drop cloth, plastic tarp, etc., as long as it's clear), held in place by a strip of lath on each edge, which is stapled or brad nailed to the window frame.  The clear plastic provides an airflow seal, some trapped air insulation, and physical protection (less so than acrylic sheet, but still much better than nothing), and is very inexpensive: they used to sell kits in hardware stores, but you can buy clear plastic sheet, lath, and brads cheaply at the big box home improvement stored.  These are disposable; removing them in the spring destroys at least the plastic.  They're cheap enough, however, that that isn't a big deal compared to the heating fuel savings.Long term, you're best off if you can afford to have the windows replaced with proper multipane glass -- but temporary storm windows are a good, cheap, short term solution that worked well for many years before the current solution was available.
What is a cost effective way to eliminate heat loss through windows?
I've seen my grandmother put saran wrap on the windows of her old lakeside house in the winter. When I traveled in New Zealand where most of the houses seemed poorly insulated, I saw a lot of people put saran wrap on their windows for the winter. Basically, they would stick the saran wrap directly to the glass in order to cover its entire surface.
What is a cost effective way to eliminate heat loss through windows?
One really effective way is to add a new pane to the windows. This can be done as a temporary storm window as suggested by Zeiss Ikon on the outside, or it can be done on the inside.If done on the inside it doesn't demand that much work securing the new pane as the weather doesn't have access to it. This also means you can use simpler arrangement for attaching the extra pane. So my suggestion would be to buy acrylic glass/plexiglass (4mm?), which can be bought at reasonable prices, and simply use a saw to fit them to the inner frame of your window. This extra layer between the real window and the extra pane will give you some extra insulation.And if done properly, you can easily reuse the panes the following year. Depending on your handyman skills, you could also attach a simple frame for easier handling. 
What is a cost effective way to eliminate heat loss through windows?
Science to the rescue!  3M makes a type of insulating window film similar to saran wrap but thicker and designed to be applied with a hair dryer so it shrinks to be perfectly clear around your window frames.At about $15 for 5 windows, it fits your cost parameters too.

What is a cost effective way to eliminate heat loss through windows?
Home-made pelmetsHeavy curtains are a good start if you can afford them, but if you already have curtains or blinds of any kind, adding pelmets will make a significant difference. Pelmets reduce convection currents, whereby air coming into contact with the window surface cools down, falls to the floor and pulls more warm air down past the top of the curtain, ad infinitum. With such a tight budget, making your own pelmets is probably the best option. Google "home-made pelmets" for some instructions. (You could also try "box valance" instead of pelmet.)Here are a couple of examples: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-save-heat-money-and-energy-with-easy-pelm/http://www.thecreativityexchange.com/2012/11/how-to-diy-a-pelmet-or-box-valance.html
What is a cost effective way to eliminate heat loss through windows?
Put weather stripping on moving parts, and then apply a special plastic film over the window area, trapping a layer of air between it and the window.Check out "How to Weatherize Windows with Plastic Film Insulation" from Green Dream, for a simple demo of how to do this cheaply.
What is a cost effective way to eliminate heat loss through windows?
I've successfully used pieces of bubble wrap trimmed to fit the glass, with no gaps at the side.  You can wet the smooth side of the bubble wrap with soap/detergent and water, and simply stick it to the glass.Light transmission is a little reduced, but the view is obscured significantly.The cost is probably $0, and you can layer this solution with curtains and other suggestions.
How to effectively and regularly clean 1200sqft of carpet?
Coming from a door to door vacuum salesman, I would have to bring up a point regarding standard retail store vacuum quality. These vacuums are intended for basic cleaning, the beater bar and other components of a vacuum simply are not designed with standards. You can easily "kill" a ANY vacuum purchased at walmart, target, and other big retail stores in your area.Kirby, FilterQueen, Electrolux and others are simply in a different breed of "Quality". If you are needing a vacuum that is going to hold up to your environment, and at the same time provide proper micron filtering (HEPA quality) to prevent indoor air pollution (HUGE DIFFERENCE with these vacuums stated above), you should serious invest in one of the higher quality vacuums. You should be able to find one of these in a local shop that specializes in "Vacuums". I would not shy from 2nd hand ones either as these vacuums are PROVEN to last many many many more years than your Dirt Devil or Dyson. (Do a good clean, replace ALL filters before using the vacuum inside your home if you buy a 2nd hand one).GL
How to keep laptop on your lap and still be safe?
You can use a slim wooden cutting board, which is both cheap and very lightweight. I have been using that method for 4 years now and I've had no problems so far.My laptop isn't overheating plus the board is strong enough and doesn't bend.My laptop is 15.6 inches.
How to harden finished papercraft?
You could add layers of more paper over the current one. For this you can use mixture of white glue and water. For paper layers you can use toilet paper or kitchen paper. Other kind of paper can be used too.Probably first you will need to protect the base from deformations if it gets wet when you put the glue on it. This can be done with some kind of acrylic spray or paint spray which becomes water resistant after drying.Add several layers and let it dry. On the top layer you can achieve smooth surface when you put several layers of:gluemixture of glue, flour, salt gypsum (plaster)You can test first on something smaller to see how it works for your case
How to dry out a wet backpack
As a mailman I often used a hairdryer in addition to dry towels inside.
How to seal the plastic bags airtight after opening without using rubber band?
You now buy online this sealing cap to keep your food in plastic bag in airtight condition, however this can only be use for food in granule or kibble sizing, not noodles
Cable lock with lost key
Depending on the type of lock, a locksmith may be able to first pick the lock (open it without the key), and then make a new key to fit.  This is likely to cost approximately as much as a new lock, however, so best ask about cost before leaving the lock with the locksmith.  It's almost certain to be cost effective, however, if you can pick the lock yourself and make the new key yourself.  There are many YouTube videos on how to do this, and neither task is especially difficult, even with improvised tools (I picked my first lock in under ten minutes, with a bent paper clip and small screwdriver).Of course, this more or less assumes it's a conventional single-bitted pin- or disc-tumbler lock.  If it's a more sophisticated type (double-bitted, barrel key, magnetic, or other complex type), it may be very difficult even to pick, never mind to fabricate a key.  If that's the case, you're ahead to cut the lock or cable off the bike (an abrasive wheel on a rotary tool or angle grinder works better than any other method I've tried), and get a new lock (as well as a duplicate key to keep in a safe place at home).Even if the latter case is the only way out, if you're interested in such things you might keep the lock mechanism itself to learn from.
How to seal the plastic bags airtight after opening without using rubber band?
I use wood clothes pins (clothes pegs, as they call them in British English), the kind made from two pieces of wood with a strong steel spring in the middle.  They're very inexpensive (last time I bought some, I got fifty or so for two dollars), and as long as the bag didn't tear down the side, one or two will close almost anything.  I use them for cereal (they stuff down inside the box while clipped on the inner bag), coffee (I buy beans in a bag, and the wire tie built in is almost worthless when the contents are 25% gone), bread, and other similar things.For a product like ramen, I'd probably just drop the package into a quart (liter) or gallon (four liter) zipper bag.  With dry contents, these are reusable for a rather long time, and as airtight as the original packaging (personally, I can't picture eating less than a full package of ramen at once, but I know some folks eat very small portions); if you squeeze out the air when closing, they'll keep a product like ramen for a few weeks without noticeable staleness.
How to build a very close shaving shaver?
The best shaves I've ever had were from an old-fashioned "cut-throat" straight razor.  I could get a shave that would leave my cheeks and chin positively shiny for many hours, and wouldn't show actual stubble for two days (this was in my late 20s).In conjunction with the traditional razor, I used a hot water soak to soften my whiskers, hot soap from a mug applied with a shaving brush, and an after shave astringent that tightened the skin pores -- this last may be a bad idea, depending how curly your beard is.Shaving with a straight razor requires practice and patience, and a good deal of care to begin with, but the results are unequalled by any other method.
How to reduce creepy crawly insects in the house?
Told by a pest control guy that you should make sure that shrubs and bushes are cut back from the house at least a foot. And make sure that the foundation sticks up above the ground at least 6 inches. Of course you need to make sure all your windows and doors have good seals.
How do I keep saran wrap (plastic wrap, cling wrap) from clinging to itself?
The trick is to not cut the wrap until you have wrapped the meat.  Hold the meat in one hand and pull the wrap towards you with the other.  Now place the wrap on the meat and rotate the meat towards you such that you're wrapping it.I don't know how much you wrap it.  I would imagine quite a lot, as you're hitting it with a hammer.  In any case, wrap it until your satisfied, and then use the cutting device.
How do I keep salt from eroding a concrete driveway?
If the effect is indeed salt, then your best option is to try to avoid the salt staying there for any prolonged time. This is hard to achieve, but you could maybe wash out your driveway after a period where you know there has been used a lot of salt on the roads. Similarily you could/should wash the bottom of your car to remove salt from it. This also helps the car from rusting, as the salt accelerates the rust process.But other than this, I do believe you need to look at other forms of treatment of your driveway. You could possibly get some dedicated painting, which could help you a little...
How do I keep saran wrap (plastic wrap, cling wrap) from clinging to itself?
Another option could be to use one piece of cling wrap. Stretch it out on your counter top, place the meat onto it, and then fold the cling wrap back and cut it. If your issue is separating the cling wrap after you've hammered the meat, you could place a piece of paper near the end of the cling wrap so that this part of the cling wrap doesn't cling onto the underlying cling wrap.
How to build a very close shaving shaver?
I've edited your post quite a bit as it was very chatty, and confusing. Hopefully I've maintained your original meaning, even though it doesn't really make sense. The fashion hasn't in most places I've heard about gone to such a step that razors aren't able to give you a clean shave. This sounds like more of a problem with your shaving technique, than a problem with the razor.So possibly the following will help you, where I use a standard razor and does the following when I shave my self:Wash/rinse your face with warm water, and apply shaving foam/gelStarting on one cheek, I shave going downwards allowing the razor to glide along my skinAfter completing the cheek, and under my chin on that side, I shave the opposite way (against the hair), to get an even closer shaveRepeat for other side/cheek, first going downwars, and then upwards against the hairsFinish off with shaving above and under mouth, and the final portion under the chinAt very end, rinse off any excess shaving foam/gel, and apply after shave if you like that
I'm walking in a busy street, then my flip flop suddenly breaks, what to do now?
Go to the nearest cafe and take some cocktail tooth picks and use them to keep the strap in place.You can do this by pushing the strap back through the hole and then pushing the cocktail sticks through the plastic bobble end bit in a cross shape. If the wooden/plastic cocktail stick is not strong enough to push through the material, use a fork to create a hole first to push the cocktail stick through.
How to fold clothes to save packing space for travel?
I've seen answers to this many times before but the most efficient way is to use vacuum plastic bags where you put your clothes in a plastic bag and then suck the air out. This is theoretically the most efficient space saving method. This article has a cheap way of performing this function. Which is just putting your clothes/fabrics in a plastic bag (that has no holes), close the bag and slide in a hose of any vacuum and let it vacuum all the air out it can. Once it stops shrinking, remove the hose from the bag and tie the bag shut.
How can I remove ants from black ingredients?
You could get a sieve with holes large enough for the ants to fall but the leaves (or whatever) to stay put. Place leaves in the sieve and shake around a few times for the ants to fall through the holes but the leaves (or whatever) remains in the sieve and then you can tip the leaves in to a clean container and repeat the process.
I'm walking in a busy street, then my flip flop suddenly breaks, what to do now?
Since you stated that :I'm walking in a busy street, then my flip flop suddenly breaks what to do now?You can use chewing gum if you have one and then chew it till it become little bit soft and then take it out with your hand from mouth and use it as a gum. It seems quite odd but still it will be helpful for longer time.
How to revive dried up pens
Seconding user19's point about heat, but if neither running water, sunlight or a flame are available try the following:For most cheap ballpoint pens, the bit that actually holds the ink is a narrow piece of plastic tubing with a nib on the end. You can usually remove this part from the outer casing by taking off the end cap at the back of the pen and tipping it out. Gently flex the tube with your fingers a few times. The motion plus the heat from your fingers frees up the ink flow.This is assuming that the pen is broadly similar to the "Bic" brand. I've included that link for illustrative purposes only and not at all because some of the reviews are hilarious. 
How to stop cats from chewing my headphones?
You could sew a fabric casing for the cord part of your headphones. I've had cats that liked to chew on rubber/plastic cords (including electrical cords!), and the best solution I found was to make little fabric casings for the cords. It can be very thin fabric, because the purpose of the fabric is to change the texture to make it less attractive, not to be an impenetrable barrier. A thin flannel would be good; comfortable on your face, but icky on the cat's tongue.
Permanent marker on a dry erase board?

How to keep bed dry while lactating
Super-soaker diaper pads containing sodium polyacrylate, carboxymethylcellulose etc. can soak up a tremendous amount of liquid. If the mother cannot lay directly on a pad (even an adult-sized diaper), the absorbent powder could be sandwiched between towels and left on the bed.
How can I neutralize the odor of Tide washing detergent?
Add 1/2 cup of household ammonia to your front load washer and add the stinky articles. Wash without adding any other detergent or softener. This should do the trick. I hate the smell of Tide, febreeze, and Downy! (I think the birds that fly above our homes do, too.) Despite what commercials say, something is only clean when it DOESNT have a scent!
How can I remove ants from black ingredients?
Ants tend to ditch chaotic instances. Assuming that the ants are alive, gently shake the ingredients in an open container and leave it in the open. They will panic and leave. Repeat the same a couple of times to make sure you problem is ant-free.
Remove Drops of Wood Varnish on LED TV
I would expect using a solvent could make the situation worse by potentially damaging the surface of the LED screen.A potential approach would be to dab it with a tiny amounts of turpentine to loosen it and then use a sharp kitchen knife or stanley blade and gently scrape the spot until it is removed from the LED surface without damaging the LED surface itself.
Remove Drops of Wood Varnish on LED TV
It's likely the only chance you have is if the varnish is water based; otherwise, it's probably chemically bonded to the screen surface and there'll be no way to remove it without taking a chunk out of the screen.  You might try scraping with the edge of a credit card held very carefully so the entire edge is in contact; this will minimize the risk of scratching, but it's still likely you'll make a much more noticeable mark.You might also check whether you can get a replacement screen cover for your television.  Replacing the screen cover is likely to be the most effective repair.
Remotely turning off a router - is it possible?
There should be a box on the web interface under 'Wireless settings' -> 'enable wireless radio'.  Check/Uncheck box to turn on/off the signal.  
Remotely turning off a router - is it possible?
Assuming the router itself does not have a feature to control access times…If you want the control to be completely automated (on/off at specific times), you can use an "outlet timer" to cut off the power and turn it back on at whatever times you program. No intervention required. Search Outlet TimersIf want to manually control when you are done for the day, you can plug the device into an "outlet remote" to turn the power off from downstairs. Make sure the model you selected uses an RF signal (not infrared) so the signal will go through the house to the floors upstairs.  Search Outlet Remotes
I'm walking in a busy street, then my flip flop suddenly breaks, what to do now?
I think your biggest problem will be having anything on you to fix a flip-flop with if you are just walking down the street unprepared. But from the pic you posted, the first thing that comes to mind is pushing the "post" of the flip-flop through the hole that is now too big, then wrapping it with a rubber band or a hair scrunchy on the bottom of the shoe.
How to fold clothes to save packing space for travel?
The roll you are describing is sometimes referred to as a ranger roll, (see google search for ranger roll with answers like this one) and this can be applied to most kind of clothings. To do it with t-shirts, long sleeves, polo and sweaters, should be easy to do. Just fold the sleeves down along the garment, and roll as usual.The pants is a little more tricky, but the trick is to make the fold at the waist line, and to keep the flies/fly-front/zip open and kept slightly apart to keep these from bulking up. Also remember to turn the pants around so that the final pocket to wrap around the bundle is the back of the pants, and not the front. After this preparation, you just roll and wrap like normal.Socks can also be ranger rolled, but I prefer to simply put two socks together and wrap one around the other. It still makes for a neat little bundle.For other miscellaneous items, put them inbetween the others, possibly in bags or boxes if that is suitable. But at least your clothes should now be in nice little rolls and bundles. Easily accessible and packable.
Remove Drops of Wood Varnish on LED TV
As the usual solutions of using various kind of solvents have the potential of damaging your screen, I would go ask someone professional how they would handle it.Try asking at the shop were you bought it, or a shop selling LCD screens, and ask for their advice. Either on how to do it yourself, or if they can recommend someone to help you in your predicament.
Remotely turning off a router - is it possible?
Buy yourself one or more extension cords to make the journey from an outlet you can reach to the router.With that in mind, you could set up a whole network of extension cords to disperse the draw of electricity to multiple circuit breakers.  Then have a bunch of power strips near you to act as on/off switches.  That can get dangerous, so don't go crazy with it.The safer alternative would be to buy a long Ethernet cable and keep the router near you.  I imagine this would be more extensive though.
Remotely turning off a router - is it possible?
If you have separate fuses for the other floor (which are situated on the first floor) then you can use their circuit breakers to turn off electricity on the other floor. I have something like this at home:Yours may be different cause you live in another country.These circuit breakers are not made for often switching, but they wont damage if you turn off power several times until you are not sick any more.Of course you have to check if this will turn off electricity for other electric appliances which must work all the time - like refrigerator, home heating system or other.

How to keep laptop on your lap and still be safe?
I use a lap tray (may be called a cushioned lap tray or bean bag lap tray) of the sort designed for people to eat their meal on.  It has a lip around the edge so the (in my case) netbook doesn't slip off, and the bean bag cushion means it moulds to my legs.
How to clean the purge valve of a snorkel?
Vinegar.As you say, the chlorine will have killed it, if it was ever alive.  So you need to remove the residue, not kill it.I soak my snorkel in a bowl of water that has something acidic added, ordinary vinegar is fine.  It won't attack the plastic.After a couple of hours, it should then wash out if you flush the snorkel with clean water.  Give the valve a good blow afterwards just in case any residue still sits against the seal - it will come out.
Remotely turning off a router - is it possible?
I have a perfect solution for it which I am using in my house to control the room lights and fan. You can use the same to completely switch off the router. You can control your router (Turn ON & Turn OFF) from your phone but this is more related to Electronics which I think you don't want for your problem. Anyways a better solution is to use a long wire. Plug the one end of the wire to a switch board nearby your place and one end to the cable of your router. Ask you friend to do this for you. Now you can turn off you router from the switch board near you. 
How to clean the purge valve of a snorkel?
Use a bottle cleaner with appropriate size. Put it inside the snorkel from the top and make circular movements. Or you can make something similar to this bottle cleaner.Cut a sponge in long and narrow piece. Put the piece of sponge in the mouthpiece while holding one end (you need to pull it back after that) and use something flexible from the top to press it down to the valve.
How do I stop/discourage people from stealing from my car?
Put a security camera or 2 on the car.  Put up a sign that says "Security cameras in use."  
How do I stop/discourage people from stealing from my car?
Given people are stealing parts off the cars, rather than stuff from inside, the only things that are likely to work are either moving to a better neighborhood, or finding a way to park the car elsewhere or inside a locked/secure shelter.  My own solution, for many years, was to drive a very plain, old car that's no temptation, but I realize many people won't find that acceptable.
How to clean the purge valve of a snorkel?
Best thing for that purge valve is to buy a snorkel that doesn't have one.  I snorkeled for years in open water with a plain J-tube snorkel, and never had any scum in my snorkel.  Put a little air bubble into the tube with your face to the surface when you start upward, and the pressure reduction will force the water out and leave just a few drops in the bend.  Those will expel easily from the smooth tube with a vigorous exhalation.  All the soft flex tube, purge valves and such are just money traps.
How do I stop/discourage people from stealing from my car?
You can choose one of these:light with sensor which swithces on when somebody comes near the carfake camera with a sign near the carreal camera with a sign near the car (in my country if  there is no sign then video recording can't be used in the court)Bad dog in your yard which will frighten the offenders (not really bad just one which is making alot of noise when someone approaches the car)It will be good if you can put a pylon near the car and attach the camera or light on it to be close to the car.
How to see white tile/grout cleaner on white tile with white grout
Add an organic dye to the bleach gel just before application.  It would guide you in placement and be bleached away in time (seconds, minutes, hours) depending on bleach and dye in question, any residual should be rinsed away.  I would start with food colouring and work to inks and then more interesting stuff like organic pigments.EDIT:For a gel type bleaching product that you need to make visible I would use a contrasting coloured powder that you blow/shake or dust on to the gel during application.  You could use household products like corn starch for black tiles and cocoa powder for light tile. You could use a salt shaker, a cloth bag or hem marker.After application you rinse off gel and dust.
How can I automatically open my chicken coop door in the morning?
Have a cat flap type arrangement and add a small latch that is released with a small 5V solenoid.  Fit a over large 24V solar panel (with LDO voltage regulator) to release the solenoid catch at dawn (orient the panel wisely towards winter dawn) even if overcast.After the first hen is through the door you can have it stay open until roosting time when you swing it closed, as the sun sets the latch will lock at which point the hens are secure.  Make the door open outward to deter visitors if roosting is before sunset and you have closed up but lock is still open. Solar panel should be pointing away from sunset side so unless you have bright overcast the panel should be receiving little evening light.As a added benefit your night time security visit may allow you to unlock door to peek inside by illuminating solar panel with your torch.
How do I stop/discourage people from stealing from my car?
Simply park in the garage if you can. I cannot, simply put up a fake camera and a working blinking light to scare away the kids. This is a crime, not something you can simply rage about. Contact the police and tell them about the string or robberies and they might check on your car on their daily patrols. Even better, install a real camera and catch them red-handed.
How can I clean a textured bathtub?
Apply the Scrubbing Bubbles Shower Foamer, then use something like this to scrub the tub.
How can I clean a textured bathtub?
An oscillating brush will work a lot better than a rotary brush to get into tiny indentations.  I'd suggest an electric toothbrush as an experiment (obviously, use a head you won't use in your mouth again); if that works well, you may be able to find a brush attachment for a "multi-tool" oscillating head (a cordless type is safer, though a corded tool is okay if you have a GFCI -- Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter -- to connect it to mains power).
How to keep bed dry while lactating
First, the leaking is not caused by overproduction. The letdown mechanism is just a little too sensitive in some women at first. Second, the leaking will settle down over time, as the mechanism fine tunes and everything sort of "stabilizes."Next, take a close look at the nursing pads. They should not be plastic backed. Cloth pads that you can wash and dry with the diapers are the best. Change them frequently during the day so the skin is not sitting against damp cloth. Try to have an hour a day of "air drying". These changes will make the skin much happier and may make it feasible to wear the pads at night, which is the easiest way to protect the bed.If it's still impossible to wear the pads at night, sleep on a towel, possibly one folded a few times for more thickness and absorbency. Wear a soft Tshirt to help keep the milk somewhat confined. (Sorry to freak out the uninitiated, but milk can occasionally spray out and that would mean a larger part of the bed gets wet.) If the volume is dramatic, look for a large bed pad (designed for bedwetters) that is plushy above and waterproof below. These are washable also. Be patient. The leakage will settle down and the skin will get happier too.
How can I remove ants from black ingredients?
I think that using "bait" for the ants is also good. Scraps of food can usually fool them away.
How can I keep my face cool while on the move?
You can make a mobile face cooling hat with a portable fan (I'd suggest something like this), some ducktape, and a hat (I'd suggest a hardhat). Just tape the fan to the hat in such a way that it's touching facing your face and BAM! Mobile face cooler.
How can I keep my face cool while on the move?
Keep a wet towel around your neck. Wipe your face with from time to time.(Nethack fans will do it with #wipe)Evaporation of water on your skin will cool your skin. Physical reason is latent heat.Cooling base of neck has a medical reason (2009, Han et. al) resulting in cooler body. Blood vessels near skin transport a lot of blood towards the head and can be cooled by the wet towel. This helps to regulate whole body temperature.
Warming up when getting out of bed in morning
Just get yourself a timer which you can plug into the socket and plug the heater into the timer socket. The alternative would be to accept the cold bedroom. There is no quicker way to wake up and be be spritely early on a winter morning.
How can I clean a textured bathtub?
I'd say your best bet would be to find a product containing potassium hydroxide (normally used in oven cleaners and fat removers). I'm using a concentrate called "Concentryl" which I dilute und put in a sprayer. You can use it on just about anything except aluminium. Let it work a couple of minutes and then lightly brush and wash off. Should be a doddle, to get the tub clean!(Only work with rubber gloves as the product is acidic)
How to keep bed dry while lactating
Don't worry too much, breasts don't stay "leaky". Your real problem are sore nipples from breastfeeding. If you know a beekeeper get yourself some homemade honey and ask him if he can let you have some propolis. Propolis is like an antibiotic the bees produce to keep their hives healthy. You (or the beekeeper) have to liquify it in alcohlol to get a 30% alcohol/propolis tincture. Take a small jar and mix honey with propolis tincture (roughly 1 tablesoon honey to 10 drops of propolis). If you put some of the mix on any open wound or skin sore the problem will disappear within a couple of days. And in your case it has the added advantage of not presenting any danger to your baby like most ordinary medicine would do. And from the moment you put it on your nipples you'll be able to use any pad without it hurting too much.
Warming up when getting out of bed in morning
Look for Belkin WeMo switch. You can plug your heater into that, and then control it with your smartphone or tablet over wifi. I think even IFTTT works with WeMo, also.
How do I identify if the Perfume is not a replica/counterfeit /fake?
You don't see them, you don't taste them, you smell them! If you can't smell a difference, ask yourself what you're actually doing! If you need the prestige, go buy in a top shop where you'll be seen buying the right thing. If the scent is what matters, choose blindfolded and get what smells best to you or to the person you want to impress.
How do I identify if the Perfume is not a replica/counterfeit /fake?
Precise analysis such as careful gas chromatography and mass spectrometry might show a difference, if the counterfeiter is inaccurate. It would need to be carried out over the lifetime of the scent, since it is claimed the the original product has greater lastingness, which could be achieved by microencapsulation, chemical synthesis, etc. On the other hand, it would be possible to counterfeit a fragrance perfectly, so that it is indistinguishable from the original -- after all, they are both produced using a formula.
Is there a way to avoid condensation of water on the inside of window panes?
Seal the sill and sash between the windows thoroughly with caulking, leaving just a "weep" hole or two at the bottom so moisture can drain from between the panes.Seal the window sash pulley holes if it's an older-style window with sash weights.Cover the windows with a shade at night. It might help to put a bit of self-stick hook-and-loop tape ("Velcro") at the edges of the shade and the window frame. This provides a third layer of insulation and keeps moist air from impinging on the glass.Get a window insulation kit at most hardware stores.Keep humidity in the house at a reasonable level. Vent bathroom and cooking areas. (If its too low, the air feels colder and dries the skin.)
Is there a way to avoid condensation of water on the inside of window panes?
Condensation is caused by warm humid air cooling down. You can affect different parts of this process.The first thing to do is to reduce the humidity, especially as it sounds like you have very humid air already.Make sure you do not have any open containers of water evaporating.Close the toilet lid!Wash dishes promptly instead of soaking them.Get rid of any fountains, fish tanks, etc.After you take a shower or bath, keep the bathroom door shut (and the vent fan on or window open) until it has dried out.Similarly, vent steam from cooking to the outside if you can.Having fewer people in the house will also reduce the humidity (exhaled air is warm), but I doubt you want to change that.Air out in the evening, not the morning: you want to dump the warm humid air before it has a chance to deposit its water on the windows.Finally, you could use a dehumidifier.You can also keep the air on the inside warmer:Fix any air leaks around the windows, so that cold air isn't mixing with the warm air and cooling it.Do not let air be trapped next to the window glass: if you have curtains/blinds/shades, make sure they are open at least at the bottom of the window, so that air cooled by the glass falls away from the window instead of staying where it is. This will of course mean the inside air loses more heat overall as it is circulating against the windows, but that can't be helped.Opposite strategy to the previous item: if you are not opening the window then seal it with an airtight cover (kits for this with clear plastic and tape can be found in hardware stores) so the humid air doesn't reach it and it stays cold.Increase the air temperature, i.e. turn the heat up. Get a programmable thermostat so you can tweak it to be just-warm-enough in the day and night.Finally, if you've done everything you can and you still have water on the windows, wipe it off regularly so that you don't grow mildew on your windows.
Is there a way to avoid condensation of water on the inside of window panes?
The windows definitely need replacing by the sound of it, but using plastic sealed at the edges over the windows will stop the problem, by and large, but obviously means you can't open the windows till spring. The other thing that might help is leaving your bedroom door open all night - breathing and body heaat create moisture, and that condenses on the cold window panes, even if the air isn't too humid already, so leaving the door open may help to disperse that humidity.I recall as a child (unheated houses other than a central fire in one room, single glazed windows) my parents and grandparents putting newspaper on the inside of the window panes when condensate appeared to soak up moisture, replacing it once it was too wet. Once into proper winter, the condensate on the inside of the windows froze, creating some rather wonderful patterns, not something commonly seen now. Those were the days when you left your clothes for the next day on the end of the bed, and in the morning, pulled them under the covers to warm them and got dressed whilst still in bed... certainly not something I'd want to do as an adult.
How to weigh my luggage before going to the Airport
The most economical solution is to make sure you don't hit the limit exactly on your scale at home. If you have had this problem on a regular basis, you will know how much error your scale has. So calculate accordingly and pack your luggage. Optionally, you can get your scale corrected to the accurate value (if it has correction options) or you can get a new scale, preferably an on-floor scale so that you don't hurt yourself hanging 23K using your fingers. 
How to weigh my luggage before going to the Airport
To test your scale and it's accurracy, which might just be bad for low weights, measure yourself with and without the luggage and calculate the difference (also works a treat for measuring a dog, which you can't put on a scale by itself).Apart from that I'd say measuring with a scale at home is the most reasonable way. Either you get to know the error/offset of your scale, or you could get a more accurate one.
How to weigh my luggage before going to the Airport
You can purchase a luggage scale, something looks like this:They are available from a lot of stores if you just google "luggage scale". They all look similar and not expensive. 
How to light a match?
Sometimes if you have a zipper on your pants it can be a good way to strike a match. The teeth and friction some times lights matches. I have tried from my Rambo first blood knife kit and it has worked for me sometimes. Also before going out rip a small piece of sandpaper and put it in the Rambo knife kit to make life easier to start a fire. There is enough room in the handle for it.V/R Daniel 
How to weigh my luggage before going to the Airport
Your scale does not match the airport's. Your goal is to make it match. Actually your goal is really just to figure out what number on your scale matches the airport scale's limit. A good tool for this is math.Write down your scale reading.Write down the airport scale reading.Do this a few times to get a reliable number, then use it to correct your reading at home. You may have to multiply (e.g. your scale is 96% of the airports) and/or add (e.g. your scale is 5 lbs under the airports), so be prepared for this intense computation.You could avoid the multiplying or adding if you just try to find the number on your scale that you have to stay below.You could also buy a new scale. As a hack, you could steal one instead of buying it, but I don't recommend this.
How to keep tobacco moist?
My personal experience and from that of the old timers is apple slices. Not only does it keep the tobacco moist, it adds a taste that pairs perfectly with tobacco.
How do we use less than one unit of a multi-component soap pod?
First make sure your dishwasher is working correctly. Using too much detergent can leave deposits, but the measured amount of detergent in those pods is based on the typical amount of water used by a dishwasher, not the "soap-to-filth" ratio. Troubleshooting dishwasher residueThat aside, you can certainly cut a pod into sections and use a fraction of the contents or make a liquid out of it. Keeping them conspicuously separate until use is mostly marketing. The capsule is made of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which is simply a water soluble polymer that dissolves in the presence of water, so everything is dispersed at once when the cycle runs anyway. Many liquid dishwasher detergents already mix the rinse agents and water softeners into their products, so making your own liquid from the contents of a pod should not be a problem.Keep in mind that these pre-measured pods are more expensive than their liquid and powder counterparts, so since you are dispensing with the convenience factor, you should try looking for alternative sources for the bottled product.Buy your dishwasher detergent onlineor perhaps you canMake your own homemade dishwasher detergent.No pods required.
How to roast a chicken in a hotel room
I am sure no hotels will allow this. Smoke detectors can go off when you attempt such a thing. If at all you want to attempt this, go to the hotel room balcony, get an open grill and do your business. Make sure you are extra careful with the whole procedure. No other appliance provided by the hotel can be used. And using an Iron box is totally inadvisable as you may spoil the iron box as well as ending up with an under-cooked chicken. Having said all that, the whole idea is inappropriate and dangerous and I think you should not do it. Order in, maybe; or ask the reception where you can do it yourself...maybe they will provide you with the area and materials needed for the same.  
What is the quickest way to defrost a frozen chicken breast?
There's a commercial device called a Miracle Thaw -- a simple aluminum plate that you warm in hot tap water and lay the meat on.  The high conductivity of the metal quickly transfers heat into the meat, and will thaw a chicken breast in about a half hour (turn at 15 minutes).But, you don't actually need the branded item; you can do the same thing on a metal range top.  Heat the oven to baking temperature and turn it off (assuming it's under the range surface -- if not, this still works, but takes longer), put a sheet of foil on the range top (to protect both the range and the chicken cut), and lay the chicken on the foil.  Turn in twenty minutes or so, and your chicken breast will be thawed in much less than an hour.
Replacement for a bathroom water drain cylinder
Properly, the fellow who lost the plastic piece should replace it at no cost to you or your landlord -- his mistake, his responsibility to correct.Failing that, however, you may be able to find a standard PVC pipe cap that's the right size to sit on the shoulder inside the drain body, and drill through the interior of the cap to allow water flow and regain the trap function.
Turn up adhesive stick forever dried up
Dip a cloth in warm water, squeeze out excess water and place it over the tip of the glue stick and close the cap over it. Glue sticks generally consists of 40% water and 40% Acrylic polymer (Referred from Wikipedia), so re-moistening should help. Since it is a polymer, a higher temperature will help in speeding up the bonding process of water to the components in the glue stick. Make sure you don't over moisten it with too much water, which may result in the loss of adhesive property of the glue. And also make sure you change the cloth periodically so that it doesn't dry up and stick to the glue stick.  
Remove Ink That's Scribbled on top of Printed Text?
Rubbing Alcohol, acetone or freshly squeezed lime juice could help. Avoid using ink rubbers. You may end up losing the data beneath the ink. The ink may not disappear completely, but it should lighten, well enough to read the text underneath the stain. Be extra careful if the data is of high priority. Also make sure the ink has no reactive hazards with the materials suggested above.
Remove Ink That's Scribbled on top of Printed Text?
Ball point ink is oil based, so oil based solvents will often soften or lift it.  They will make a translucent spot in the paper, but that won't affect legibility of the print if it's only on one side.  Soak the ink in vegetable oil, wait a half hour or so, and then blot carefully with a tissue or paper towel.  If there's any improvement, but you still can't read the printed word, you can repeat the soak and blot cycles as needed.Laser print is plastic, fused onto the paper, while ink jet ink is water soluble.  Neither one should be affected by vegetable oil, as long as you don't damage the oil-soaked base paper by rubbing.
How to remove lint from a shirt without a lint brush?
This happens to me sometimes too, I also have dogs at home so have to deal with the hair as well. I have found that in a jam with no lint brush a slightly damp washcloth will do the trick. You must make sure that you ring it out the washcloth completely!Lightly brush the washcloth over your jacket removing the lint.

Remove Ink That's Scribbled on top of Printed Text?
Bic's website, bicworld.com..., recommends an alcohol based hair spray for their ballpoint pens and an "all-purpose cleaner" for their roller/gel/highlighters.
How do I remove postal stamps neatly from envelopes?
Forty years or so ago, we used to do this by putting a damp paper towel over the stamp and heating with an electric iron set to "cotton".  The steam would debond the adhesive, freeing the stamp from the envelope without damage.  This only takes 10-15 seconds.I should add that this and other water or steam methods only work with stamps that require moistening to apply.  Newer US stamps have a peel-and-stick adhesive that will respond better to the lighter fluid (naptha, Goof-Off, etc.) solvents that attack the pressure sensitive adhesive.
How to remove color from clothes
Wash it again, in the hottest water it can stand (read label) using your normal detergent and a Color Catcher(tm). This works for me about 90% of the time if I haven't used the dryer to dry it. If a dryer was used, try it anyway, you might get lucky. It also might take more than 1 washing depending how intense the color transfer, type of material, time passed, etc. Good Luck!
How do I prevent pencils from breaking?
If you need to not have a broken pencil, just dip it in water for a few minutes. Your pencil will not have to  be pushed down as much, therefore it will not break as easily.
How can I avoid sweating while sleeping?
Sweat is your body's natural ventilation system. When you sweat, it means only one thing: "Your body temperature is higher than the natural temperature and needs to be cooled down with the help of evaporation". Either you have a slightly elevated body temperature or the air around you isn't cool enough for your body to function ideally. Try increasing the speed of your fan or lower the temperature of your Air Conditioner. If neither of that helps, you have an elevated temperature. There's not much you can do about that. Just to be on the safer side, consult a doctor, in case your body is trying to tell you something (maybe an infection or a persistent problem).  
How do I prevent pencils from breaking?
I prefer mechanical pencils, but the quality and grade of the pencil will determine how durable it is. Pencil lead is a mix of graphite and clay, sometimes with additional materials to hold it together. Higher quality pencils may have something like "chemically bonded" printed on them, which indicates that there are extra adhesives in the lead to make it stronger.Pencils also have a grade marked by the letters H (for hard) and B (for black). The most common grade is HB which gives a good compromise between well defined lines and darkness of the line. If you choose a B grade, maybe B2 or B3, the pencil will be softer and less likely to break because although it is softer, it is less brittle.Take care of your pencils. Dropping them or shaking them around in a pencil case with other pens and pencil can cause fractures in the lead that aren't apparent until you've sharpened them down to that point.There are many pencil sharpeners available that catch and store the shavings. If you use one of these, you shouldn't need to move from your desk when you have to sharpen a pencil.
How can I avoid sweating while sleeping?
As others have pointed out, some amount of sweating is normal, and you don't want to get too cold in your sleep. It sounds like you're saying that you're sweating excessively while you sleep and this is a recent change. Here are three things you can do to keep from overheating while you sleep:Use blankets made from breathable material. Often when we sweat it is because the air around us isn't circulating. Have you ever seen a movie where someone wanted to lose some water weight quickly so they wore a garbage bag so they'd sweat it off? If you're using sheets or blankets that don't breathe then that's what you're doing to yourself at night.Materials that don't breathe are typically synthetic materials. For example a blanket made out of any of these materials most likely doesn't breathe: fleece, polyester, microflannel. Materials that breathe are typically natural materials like cotton, wool, silk, and down.If your sheets, blanket or bedspread are made from synthetic materials that don't breathe then that's the most likely culprit. Try swapping them out with all cotton sheets and a wool blanket. Or, the best solution for cold climates, use 100% cotton sheets with a quality down duvet.A note on getting a quality down duvet: You want a down duvet that contains mostly down and only a few feathers. It is the down that breathes and maintains your body temperature so well. Feathers are often used in duvets as filler. A duvet that contains a lot of feathers won't be much better than a cheap synthetic blanket. To get the breatheability and comfort benefits from down you need a high quality duvet that is filled 90% to 95% with down and only 10% to 5% with feathers. Even the highest priced duvets sold at places like Sears, Bed Bath and Beyond, Walmart, and Cotsco most likely do not fit this bill. How do you know if the duvet contains 90% to 95% down? Most duvets available at mainstream stores in the United States do not. If the manufacturer does not advertise that the duvet contains 90% - 95% down, then it doesn't. You'll need to search the internet and learn what makes a good duvet, so you'll know what to look for in a duvet and where you can find them.Here are a couple of links to get you started. The information on this website is excellent. Unfortunately the owner has retired and they no longer sell duvets, so you'll have to find another duvet maker who makes quality duvets. Fortunately their website is still up and the down duvet information is still accessible. If you can find another maker who makes duvets as good as this place, then you're all set:Down FactsDuvet InformationSleep in clothes made from breathable material: The same factors that apply to your bed sheets and blankets also apply to the clothes you wear while you sleep. Avoid synthetic materials that don't breathe; Wear clothes made only from breathable fibers. Cotton, wool, and silk are excellent material for clothes you're going to wear to sleep.What you're eating or drinking before bed, or earlier in the day, could be affecting your metabolism and causing you to get hot at night. For example alcohol, wheat, milk, or caffeine can make some people overheat while they sleep. Investigate on the internet and conduct your own experiments by removing suspect foods from your diet temporarily to see if you notice a change. Since you mention that the sweating at night is a recent change, alcohol is a good place to start. Many people find that alcohol affects their sleep pattern and body temperature differently as they get older - it wakes them up in the middle of the night and/or makes them hot.When those three things are all in order, and the temperature of the room you are sleeping in is reasonable, then you should find your body temperature comfortable throughout the night.
How to get rid of dandruff from hairs?
I believe it is worth mentioning that washing your hair more often because of the dandruff can be counterproductive. Most shampoos are quite harsh detergents that also remove all the good stuff from your scalp that keeps the skin and hair healthy. If you wash your hair too often you dry out the skin and encourage it to get greasier more quickly because it is trying to counteract the stripping of oils by the shampoo.One thing you could try is to reduce the frequency of washes. It takes some time for your scalp to adjust, but after a while it will produce less oil.What I sometimes do, is I massage some oil (my favourite is coconut, but you can use olive/almond/etc. as well) into my scalp and onto the ends of my hair (they tend to get frizzy) some hours before I'm going to wash my hair or leave it in over night. An egg mask is also a low-budget, less harsh way to treat damaged hair (this is just one exemplary recipe).Generally speaking, I would not suggest to put more stuff onto your scalp and hair, as this might dry out your hair even more.
How can I transport a book in a backpack without getting the corners bent?
Get hold of some of the cardboard folders/envelopes/mailers that Amazon and similar companies send books out in. These are specifically designed to keep books from damage. It will add a little to the weight of your backpack but so would almost any other solution.If you don't have any yourself, ask around. A lot of people keep them for recycling or re-use. Bibliophiles tend to build up a surplus and would probably be glad to let you have a few in various sizes.Alternatively, get an electronic reader! In my experience it pays for itself quite quickly and it certainly allows you to carry many books at the weight of one.
how do you easily turn a flash light into a lamp
The simplest method would be to use a Convex Mirror. A convex mirror reflects the light to all directions. This can be used to illuminate a small room, provided the torch is a strong enough. This is by far the easiest hack you can use. It is very economical, and efficient.

How do I stop the ends of curtain poles (finials) falling off without making a hole in them?
I would use a combination of string and tape. Use string to lock the outer ring to the support, so that it can't glide outwards and push the finial. In addition I would add a few rounds of tape on the outer end of the rod itself so that finial stays on a little tighter. If not tight enough, add another round or two of tape!
Collecting vinyl LPs on an open shelf
One way which was used back in the days, was drilling small holes in the shelf, and then using bent metal rods as shelf dividers. This could be moved at your pleasure. A variant over these theme could be to general shelf dividers (google image search).As shown in images in above linke various alternatives exists, with various support strength, but in general these can be made sturdy enough to support LP's, and still be almost invisible, and thereby really showcasing the albums.
How do I stop the ends of curtain poles (finials) falling off without making a hole in them?
Tie the outermost ring to the support.  There should be just enough slack that the ring isn't able to apply force to the finial.
How can I increase durability of my headphones?
The connection between the wire and the headphone plug is a very high-stress area, so the degree of flex the wire experiences at that point is substantial. Better-quality headphone will typically include a rubberized extension along that connection to spread out the load, but if that does not solve your problem, you can make a more substantial reinforcement yourself.You can use heat shrink wrap tubing to build a longer, more-flexible reinforcement. To make the joint stronger still, I would suggest doubling over the cable near the plug before you shrink wrap the entire bundle. That will make the flex point substantially thicker and and less prone to premature wear.And if you want to get really fancy, add a pen spring before you shrink wrap it to make a really strong, flexible connection. Related bonus tip:If you don't have shrink wrap on hand, you might want to invest in something like this product called Sugru (product search). Sugru is a moldable/shapeable, self-setting material that turns into a strong, flexible, waterproof rubber overnight. It's more expensive than shrink wrap, but you can use it for fixing, modifying, and making many things that are broken or need this type of modification.  
How can I increase durability of my headphones?
If the connection between your headset and phone is prone to break, add a short headphone extension and use that as a sacrificial part that can be replaced easily once it wears out. Look for an inexpensive extension in the shortest length you can find. They are much cheaper to replace than a high-quality headphone. Product search: Short Headphone Extension Cables

Milk crates make excellent record holders, and the fact that they can stack means that your shelving dimensions are quite flexible.
What's the most elegant way to eat a well-filled jelly doughnut (donut)?
Jelly is supposed to flow. If you do not want it to run off, you might want to cool down the doughnut to a state in which the jelly becomes a bit more rigid. Solid jelly cannot flow like its semi-solid form. The only other way of avoiding a mess is to use a tissue paper. There's not much you can do to avoid a "run-off jelly" situation, it is supposed to do that. But this doesn't qualify as a life hack. 
How can I keep my mouth closed while sleeping?
This is perfectly normal. If you still want to avoid it, there are specialized adhesive tapes available in medical shops and over the internet. The following link should help you: -------------------------------------------------Mouth Breathers-------------------------------------------
How can I keep my mouth closed while sleeping?
While it may seem counter-intuitive, getting rid of your pillow can help!sleep on your backmake a small pillow, or roll up a T-shirt and put it behind your neck, in the curve, right against the base of your skullThis will cause your head to position naturally, and will prevent you from sleeping with your mouth open.
What's the most elegant way to eat a well-filled jelly doughnut (donut)?
you could put it on a plate and eat it with a knife and fork. Any filling would overflow on to the plate and you can mop it up with other bits of doughnut.
What's the most elegant way to eat a well-filled jelly doughnut (donut)?
You could take a small bite and suck a lot of the jelly out before you eat the rest.  It works, but I wouldn't exactly call it "elegant".
What's the most elegant way to eat a well-filled jelly doughnut (donut)?
Inspect it until you find the entrance wound. If you start eating here it makes less mess than any other way. Also hold it with the hole and your bite marks at the top, so gravity is on your side as well. 
How do I remove postal stamps neatly from envelopes?
I have done this with steam; hold the stamp next to a boiling kettle so the steam wets and heats the glue, then it will peel off. You might burn your fingers so it's never boring.
How can I increase durability of my headphones?
I used to have the same problem, but now it's solved. If you've been getting the headphones with straight mic jack, and you like to wrap it around your phone, I suggest you getting your new headphones with an "L-shaped" mic jack. This way, even if you wrap your cord around something, it follows the direction at which the mic jack is bent by the L-shape. 
What's the most elegant way to eat a well-filled jelly doughnut (donut)?
Certainly the first key is to find the "entrance wound" as described in another answer. Even then, taking small bites will still cause a jelly-lanche if you aren't careful.The challenging jelly flow is caused by compressing both the top and the bottom of the jelly chamber while biting, resulting in a net flow of jelly out of the jelly chamber.To avoid this, continue to hold the jelly donut with bite marks upward, but do not bite through both the top and bottom of the jelly chamber simultaneously, instead alternate tipping the donut toward and away, and biting half the filling and the top and bottom of the chamber (respectively) on subsequent bites.Works for any high-viscosity filling. Also helpful on jucy lucy burgers, over-filled grilled cheese, densely packed burritos, and so on.

How can I avoid sweating while sleeping?
First of all, there is no need in using small amount of clothes, because you have told that you are afraid of being cold as you wake up.So use clothes as your need. 1.If you are sleeping in a room with fan or AC, switch it on and try to sleep below them.  2.If you keep a bucket full of water in your sleeping room, it would be beneficial. Because, problem here can be because of too much temperature of your living environment.So there will be less amount of water in the environment around you.Thus your body releases water in the form of sweat to balance that.Let us keep an extra bucket of water to evaporate instead of your sweat and thus balancing the humidity of your room.  3.Keeping plants in your sleeping room can also help you to control the temperature naturally.

Stand the flashlight with the lens up and put a frosted plastic medicine cup (the kind that comes with cough syrup) on the lens.  The cup will diffuse the light with little loss (less than a paper cone or cup) and no color shift.  The small cups in which single serving preserved fruit are sold will work for larger flashlights.
How to turn on the motion sensor controlled light when you're in the toilet?
I recently found out that many toilet motion sensors are based on a radar principle, and they use microwave radiation for that purpose.Thus, a very easy way to trick the motion sensor is to pick your mobile phone and start making a call. You don't have actually to make a call, just let it start making the connection as the microwave radiation will immediately interfere with the motion sensor and turn the lights back on.
How can I transport a book in a backpack without getting the corners bent?
The simplest thing to do would be putting the book in the bag with the spine facing down and nothing above it between two solid items. Beyond that, you can use something like a lunch box or Tupperware. 
How can I transport a book in a backpack without getting the corners bent?
Get an old VHS tape at a thrift store -- should cost less than a dollar.  Be sure to select the kind with a snap-closed clamshell case, not those that just slide the cassette into a sleeve.  Pull out the tape and discard it (or watch it, if you have a VHS machine and found a title you like).  Put the book where the tape was, close the case, and your book is protected.
How to prevent people accidentally turning the lights off from leaning on the switches?
The long term solution would be to have building maintenance move the switches.  I've seen that done, but how long it takes probably depends heavily on how much rent your employer pays and how important your department is within the organization.A more immediate solution would be to install a shield over those switches that are to remain on while the department is occupied.  This could be as simple as a (very) short length of large pipe cut in half lengthwise, placed so the switch can be reached from top or bottom, but so that leaning on the wall will bump the cover instead of the switch.  Attachment method is left up to the installer, but I'd suggest something like double sided tape or RTV silicone.
How can I avoid sweating while sleeping?
I also occasionally wake up sweating more depending on the season, and for me it is usually around the legs, while my upper body is fine. I assume the air does not "breathe" well enough farther into the covers, as other answers have mentioned.My solution, which works for me but may bother some, is to stick my toes out the bottom of the blanket. This opens up some ventilation which allows for more circulation of air, but not so much that you lose too much heat and become cold. If the temperature gets colder again for whatever reason, you can just kick the covers back down. It is also fairly simple to accomplish, allowing me to (almost) immediately fall back asleep.
Add white dots to a sweater
If silvery would be acceptable, a number (perhaps 4-5 pairs) of plain stainless ear piercing studs (around $5/pair last time I checked) could be pushed through and fastened on the inside with their included clasps.  These would require wearing something under the sweater, to protect your skin from the stud ends and clasps, but the studs could be removed and shouldn't leave a visible hole.
How to prevent people accidentally turning the lights off from leaning on the switches?
You can use one of these light-switch guards designed to cover the switch while still allowing deliberate access:Ironically, these are commonly called "child-proof switches"… although I'll leave any workplace jabs about that to you.Product Search: Child-Proof Light Switches
Add white dots to a sweater
You may be able to find inexpensive white buttons and sew them on. Those would be perfectly circular, of course, and would take just a little effort on your part. The trick would be positioning them so they look snowy.Another option would be to buy an iron-on t-shirt transfer sheet at an art store. They make opaque white sheets that can printed on with a home printer, and then ironed onto a shirt. If the shirt is smooth enough (not cable-knit, for example), you could cut small circles out of the white sheet and iron them on, following the instructions on the package.
How to turn on the motion sensor controlled light when you're in the toilet?
I'll assume the light won't turn on again because the sensor can't spot your hands moving within the stall.  The door and the stall walls block the sensor's "view". I can think of a few options:Try leaning back and waving your hands overhead, almost brushing the wall with your knuckles, and also moving your hands far to the left and right.  That might allow them to be "seen" over the door.Slide your feet forward under the door, then move them left and right. This might allow them to be seen "under" the door.If you can reach the door, and it opens inward, open it and close it again.If you have a jacket with you, hold onto one part of it and carefully throw the rest of it up towards the ceiling, making sure to quickly "reel it in" so it doesn't touch the floor.
Taking photos of 100+ pages using mob cam without pain in hand
Your best bet is to build a rig to fasten your mobile phone into, and get some software which takes picture at a regular time interval. Then you simply start the software, and start flipping pages. Look for stop motion or time lapse software for your camera.Lets say you take a picture every 3 second, and have a stack of 200 pages, this will take 3 * 200 seconds. In other words 600 seconds, that is 10 minutes to copy the pages and some sore fingers...
Taking photos of 100+ pages using mob cam without pain in hand
You can also take continuous shots of the pages.Just set that camera above stack of quilts and one book if you have that.Go to settings and check for continuous shots.Increase the size for example from 40 to 99.Now in camere mode take the shot by pressing the shutter for long,during this procedure turn the pages continuously,in about 5 seconds 99 shots will be taken.This procedure will fall easy but and do it till end of your notes.Now you may like to edit by selecting best shots.
Squeaky trainers with leather tongue
You could put a piece of duct tape or masking tape on the inside of the top of the shoe, where the shoe's tongue rubs. Put one piece of tape on each side of the laces, of course. Then the tongue would be rubbing against the tape rather than the inside of the shoe. And the tape wouldn't show, since it's on the inside of the shoe.I'm not sure what kind of tape would work best for this. The tape has to be strongly adhesive, but the non-stick side has to be somewhat slippery. Use your best judgment, I guess!Also, over time the heat of your foot may cause the tape's adhesive to become less tacky, and the tape might slide, so you may need to replace it every so often.
Taking photos of 100+ pages using mob cam without pain in hand
Holroy's answer is probably the best one, but I have an alternative. You could shoot a video of yourself turning the pages of the book. Then to read it, you just pause on any open page and zoom in. (I'm pretty sure my Samsung Galaxy S6 can zoom in on video when I'm paused.)And with a little more work, you could make still shots from the video. For example, you could watch the video on a computer, pause each time the pages are open, and take a screenshot. (And save it as an aptly-named file.)

Humane live capture traps work. I've seen the Havahart type capture squirrels over and over, placed outside on the ground near the base of a tree that leads to the roof. Plug the roof holes too, during the day after making noise in the attic, so you shouldn't imprison one in the attic (in which case it will probably burrow its way out and give you a new hole - squirrels can dig through wood surprisingly quickly). However it may take many such relocations, and you may need to take them a long distance, preferably across a body of water, or just to someplace even better for squirrels, such as a large wooded area (because they can find their way back - like many animals, squirrels can home in on old haunts). I have seen this work though if done enough to an attractive and distant enough destination. Not only does this not hurt them, but you may even bring them to someplace better to live.If your house design allows, you can also give access to the roof or roof-entry areas to cats and/or dogs.
How to revive dried up pens
Try shaking your pen, placing gas at the top of the pen with a lighter for at max 7 seconds minimum 3 seconds as the ink may turn red or the plastic will burn.Or how about rubbing your pen at the bottom sole of your shoe, that often does not work for me though.The easiest way for me is to draw plenty of swirls on a piece of paper lightly to begin with then with more pressure as it help build up the surface area strength. You can also just buy a new pen.
Squeaky trainers with leather tongue
Neatsfoot oil is a standard leather conditioner that should help; you might also try a very small amount of silicone oil -- being careful to avoid seams (the oil dissolves glue) and the sole (which would become slippery).
Why do shirt's bottoms "bend" after washing, and how to avoid?
It's the heat of the drier - teeshirts don't do this if you hang them up damp, first shaking them out to smooth out the worst of the creases, unkinking any twisted or rolled bits, hanging them bottom down (maybe on hangers or whatever). That's the usual cause, unless you've washed them on a hotter cycle than they can take - teeshirts are best washed around 30deg. It's something to do with the type of cotton they use to stitch them with, often the stitching thread has polyester, or may actually be 100% polyester, so the composition of the main material in the teeshirt against the stitching is different and they react differently to heat. You either need to dry them naturally, or iron them after they've come out of the drier.
When shopping for bulk food, how to get a whole-whatever-you're-getting and not a bunch of crumbs?
If it's not too heavy, you can shake the container before scooping so that the small pieces filter down through the spaces between the larger pieces.  This separation by size is called granular convection or the Brazil nut effect.
When shopping for bulk food, how to get a whole-whatever-you're-getting and not a bunch of crumbs?
If you're buying from the bulk bin, it's virtually impossible to avoid getting some broken pieces of, say, nut meats.  One way to deal with this is to buy a slightly larger weight of product than you actually need, and accept that you'll get some broken bits -- which can then be broken down further (a few pulses in a blender) to make (in the case of nut meats) nut sprinkles.  Same idea with corn flakes, you make crispy bits to coat foods before frying; with candy, you have something to mix into whipped cream or sprinkle over ice cream.In other words, if life gives you lemons, make lemonade.

Best way to clean formica.Table has turned dark in places from the sun
This link provides some ways to clean the stain, if you can't find a solution elsewhere, maybe it's worth a try. 5 Ways to Remove Stains from FormicaFirst, if it's due to age or natural discoloration, it's suggested that you just replace your countertop. If you are dealing with actual stains, you can soak it with soap water or detergent.For stubborn stains on your Formica, blend a pasty mix of water and your choice of powdered cleanser. Depending on the size of your stain, you may not need more than a few tablespoons of water. Once you have your paste, smear it out over the stain, covering it completely. Let it fully dry out and crust over, and then remove it with a warm wet washcloth, being careful to not let the abrasive nature of the dried paste scratch the surface. A quick wash down with some soap and water and you should be stain-free.An alternative paste would be using baking soda:[U]se baking soda and soda water, instead. Brush the paste on the stain, and cover it with some plastic wrap. This time, you're going to need to leave it alone for a full 24 hours for best results. Wipe the surface clean with warm water and a washcloth the following day and your stain should be a thing of the past.If it's some very stubborn stain like coffee, hair dye, watermarks, nail polish remover can be used:[B]rush some acetone nail polish remover onto the stain with some cotton balls. Before using it on a colored countertop, test it out in a hidden corner and see if it changes the color. If it does, you might want to just live with the stain. If it seems like it will work, though, try it out, and then wash down the counter with some soap and warm water.With all those said, if you are not able to clean the stain off and you cannot tolerate the stain on there, you should probably just replace your countertop. 
How do I securely tie my shoes?
A solution that's worked for me is to tie your shoes in the typical fashion. When you get to the point where you run the lace around the loop, go in the opposite direction. For instance, when I run the lace around the loop, I run it around the back of the loop then around to the front. Instead, go the opposite direction, running the lace around the front of the loop and around to the back. It's a little trickier, but apparently creates a stronger version of the typical tying method you were most likely taught as a child.

What can I use to hang my headphones off my desk?
Have you got a wire coathanger?You can break off the top (the part in the circle) and bend the rest into an headphone stand.Here is one I built (first try):I added some soft material on the part where the headband rests (the yellow stuff in the picture) and tied with some wire/hair ties the two the top part and close to the base. I'm guessing you can experiment with shapes/pieces to hold it together according to your needs.It works pretty well, but is a bit light, I'm probably gonna add some weights to the base so that it does not tip when hitting it when nothing is on it.
What can I use to hang my headphones off my desk?
If you are not afraid to drill a hole and use a saw I got a suggestion for you: Build your own headphone stand out of a piece of wood and drill a hole for the charging cable. Attach under your desk. Here is an image with the top view and side view of my suggestion:Building instructions and/or description of stand:Use a suitable piece of wood (brown in image), and drill holes for the screws on the left hand side (black circles)Drill a hole (white circle) just on the outside of where it will attach to desk the size of your charging cable, but not larger than the head of the cableUse a saw to finish the split into towards the hole. The cable should easily slide in through the slitOptional: Make a little recess at the end of the slit, so that the head of the charging cable (green) could slip a little beyond the top of your wood piece so as not to slide out Optional: If don't like the sharp edges where you hang your headphone you could taper or round off the edges in that areaAttach underneath the desk, and hang your headphone and/or charging cable to the stand
When shopping for bulk food, how to get a whole-whatever-you're-getting and not a bunch of crumbs?
This is a variation on the good answer James provided.Instead of one scoop, get two. (Just borrow one from a neighboring bulk-food bin).Use scoop 1 to take a LARGE quantity of the walnuts (more than you need).Shake scoop 1, to filter down some of the smaller pieces to the bottom.Then attempt to pour JUST the whole pieces into scoop 2. Leave as many of the smaller bits in scoop 1 as you can.Empty scoop 1, which now just has small pieces, back into the bulk food bin.Shake scoop 2, which now has a higher concentration of whole walnuts, to filter down more smaller bits to the bottom.Attempt to pour JUST the whole pieces from scoop 2 back into scoop 1.Dump scoop 2's smaller pieces back into the bin.Repeat as desired.After doing this a few times, you should have a scoop that is almost entirely full of whole / larger pieces. :)
How to hang painting frames?
Thats a great question, few days ago I asked something similar but got put "on hold". For the question I had, there was a "vintage" old frame that did not have a back cover and I was interested to know how to use it:The answer for my question at least was that there is a ridge in the inside frame where the glass cover can sit, and the art piece will be placed behind it. In turn, behind the art piece, a carboard or something solid will be placed to hold it in place. Now, because it is an older frame, the only way to secure the glass, art, and backing all together will be to drive small nails into the frame, bend them, and use them as stoppers. Hope it helps. 
How do I stop my necklace clasp from moving to the front of my neck?
If you attach the pendant to the chain of the necklace, so that the chain (and thus the clasp) can't rotate without the pendant moving with it, the weight of the pendant will keep it hanging at the front, and the clasp at the back.  Depending on how well you can hide it, a loop of metal our dab of hot glue should work.
How do I stop my necklace clasp from moving to the front of my neck?
Depending on whether this a necklace you use all the time, or just on special occasion an alternative solution could be to use some tape (or blank band aid) to fasten the necklace to the back of your neck. This of course only works if you either have long hair, or have other means to hide the band aid.If you use it all the time, you are better of with somehow fastening the pendant to the necklace as suggested in other answer.
How to clean floor if there is cooking-oil spilled on it?
You could try to put talc (aka talcum aka baby powder) on the stain and let it sink in before polishing it away. This only works with recent stains. 
How to clean floor if there is cooking-oil spilled on it?
First, you should cover the cooking oil in either kitty litter (I've found this works best, but you may not always have it) or baking soda. After waiting about 15 minutes, you can use paper towels to pick up and throw out the kitty litter/baking soda. Next, you can use a piece of bread to wipe up any oil that is left. A sponge also works here. Lastly, mop the floor with dish soap and warm water. You may need to repeat some of the steps more than once for the best result.
How do I remove a car window sticker?
For starters try using your hair blower to add heat to the sticker, and see if that doesn't help pulling it off.Next step would be to use a scraper of some sort, i.e. oven scraper or paint scraper, and use this gently. You should be able to use these without damaging the car window. If you feel uncertain, you could opt for a plastic scraper.In the end you'll most likely need to use adhesive remover, acetone, WD-40 or similar to remove the remaining sticker residue. But firstly try with just hot water and (dish washer) soap.
How do I remove a car window sticker?
The simplest method  I would opt is soap water.1) Take some soap water in a sprayer.2) With your finger nails , try to pull out sticker slowly.If you find your fingers being hurt, you could also use paper knife instead.If you find that this sticker is going to tear, apply some soap water on its adhesive side and wait.Now do step 2 with patience until you get the entire sticker gone.Now there is a chance for glass to be filled with stickers glue.You can clean this by using salt and paper.1) Take some paper and salt in it.2) Try to rub this salt contained paper so as to remove the sticker left overs. You can see them, being removed.3) Do the step 2 to complete the left overs on your glass .
How to clean floor if there is cooking-oil spilled on it?
You could use coconut husk to absorb all cooking oil. If not available, you could also use ordinary paper for the same. Thus you could later use this wasted oil at least for igniting something.Most probably, in the case if you have a wood burner.Try to clean your tile with these, not leaving even a drop of oil behind.Next, I would prefer dish washing liquid to do a final touch to your area. Take some dish washing liquid and apply it onto the area affected, with a scrubber.Wait for some time.This is used to absorb the oil left overs if any.At last, with a wet cloth, wipe out the area. And make the floor dry with a ceiling fan.

How to prevent people accidentally turning the lights off from leaning on the switches?
I would opt you to use this.Thus you and your staff can open the case and switch it off incase if not needed. At the same time, a sudden key press of lift users can be restricted too until they find the proper lift button or if they lean towards wall while waiting for lift.And I do not think that it will be much costlier one for you.Be careful when placing this case, because you are messing up with your office lights.So hire an electrician.

How can I remove sticker labels on the glass bottle?
Most paper labels on glass bottles (at least on commercial products) are glued with a water soluble glue.  I've found soaking for a few minutes in the hottest tap water available lets me peel them cleanly, or scrape them with the back of a table knife.  A quick scrub with a plastic wool pad will then remove the glue residue, then a rinse in hot water lets the bottle dry clean and clear.  I've cleaned fifty-plus beer bottles (for brewing) with this method in well under an hour.
How to clean floor if there is cooking-oil spilled on it?
I'm not 100% sure whether you're asking how to remove any staining from the oil, or whether to restore the floor to something you can walk across without slipping and sliding everywhere because its oily. And when you say 'tiles', it's not clear whether you mean ceramic tiles, or terracotta or other material. If the tiles are glazed ceramic, then you may have some residual staining in the grout between them - that will be next to impossible to remove without scraping out existing grout and redoing it. If the tiles are unglazed, or unsealed, then you won't get the stain out of those either. If, though, the problem is slipperiness, then washing the floor with a strong cleaner such as Flash, then rinsing/mopping with hot water afterwards, twice, should stop that.
How do I remove ballpoint pen ink scribblings from a laminated piece of cardboard
Baby wipes.They're extremely gentle (in terms of abrasion) so are unlikely to damage the box in any way.  If the biro is water soluble, then it should come straight off.
How to clean floor if there is cooking-oil spilled on it?
Wash with a sponge or sponge mop lightly dampened with dishwashing liquid (some brands are specially marked as "grease cutting" or "removes grease"; these are the best for this), then dry with either a dry sponge, towel, or paper towel.  It's the detergent action that will remove the oil from the tile.
How can I remove sticker labels on the glass bottle?
If the label is put on with a sticky/gummy adhesive, it is probably what they call a "cold flow" adhesive. I have found that warming the adhesive (fill the bottle with warm water) and peeling it off SLOWLY by pulling the label straight away from the glass works fairly well. Watch the line where the adhesive is separating from the glass. If you see a bit of adhesive remaining on the glass, or the label delaminating, STOP and use a knife or razor blade to get the edge repaired. Then continue pulling the label away from the glass. If you get all but a few spots of adhesive or adhesive and paper removed, use a mild solvent like lighter fluid or alcohol to remove the last bits. The solvent makes the adhesive even gummier, so reserve this for those last few dots. If you put solvent on the entire label, you will have to use a lot of solvent and a lot of time getting it all off.Another trick that seems to help with large cold flow adhesive labels is vinegar. The acid in the vinegar seems to break down the cold flow adhesive and make it easier to clean off. I've used this to remove the new car window stickers in one piece (they have valuable information you may want later). Be careful not to spill vinegar in your new car; the smell takes a long time to go away. I dampen a pad of paper towels with vinegar and press it against the label.For conventional adhesives, water works best. If the label has a foil layer that keeps the water away from the adhesive, try scoring or scratching the label in a few places to let the water through.

How can I stop my glasses from slipping down my nose?
This sounds like a joke, but I found it works well for quite some time before needing to pull my glasses up by hand. I learned to pull my glasses up with my ears! Doing that taught me how to wiggle my ears and get children to laugh, so that might be an additional reason to learn. Dunno how I started, but I was being frustrated and started not being frustrated. Sort of an unconscious learning system.
How do I place/anchor showerhead at a low height, without drilling the wall?
As I understand you don't want to fasten an extra mount in the tiles of the wall as it punctures the wall. Another option could be to utilize the edge of the bathtub and the existing mount. In between these you could wedge a plank or piece of metal onto which you could mount a new mount at any height required.If done correctly, this extra piece can be locked around the upper mount so that it stays firmly in place, and still provide a good extra place for your extra shower mount.
How can I stop my glasses from slipping down my nose?
One frequent reason for glasses slipping is perspiration.  A simple fix, assuming that is the source of the problem, is a to apply a bit of antiperspirant to each side of the bridge of the nose. Clear and unscented would be my choice.

There's no need for extra gadgets or body mods, you simply need to make the glasses a tighter fit.Tighten the screws fixing the arms to the main part of the glasses.Carefully bend the arms so that fit more tightly to your head and, in particular, so the hooks on the end fit tightly behind your ears.
How do I place/anchor showerhead at a low height, without drilling the wall?
You could use some insulated wire that hangs from the fixture down to a lower point to secure the head.  This could attach to a ring or horse shoe-shaped holder for the shower head.I suggest insulated wire as a coat hanger or the like will no doubt tarnish quickly.  You could also use rope or string.

How to sterilize/clean a cut/abrasion without causing pain
First of all "soap and water" and "wet wipe" doesn't sterilize it at all, and can be slightly harmful or irritating. It is better to use plain water to rinse it and wash of any excess dirt. I haven't used polysporin, as that particular product is not available in my country, but I've occasionally used isopropyl alcohol, which inevitably will sting.Here is a quote regarding the subject from an article named "Reducing wound pain":Wounds always hurt, but the degree of pain will vary according to the nature, location, and severity of the injury. Burns are particularly painful, as are many blisters, cuts, and scrapes.
How to clean floor if there is cooking-oil spilled on it?
First I use kitchen paper or useless piece of cloth (old towel, t-shirt) to absorb the oil as much as possible. After that I clean the floor with sponge and dish washing liquid or liquid soap and warm water. And finally use kitchen paper again to wipe dry.

How to sterilize/clean a cut/abrasion without causing pain
I'll suggest simple methods I know:First of all, the flow of blood should be stopped by applying pressure to the injured part using a cloth. As soon as it stops bleeding, follow these steps:1.Carefully remove the skin that sticks out.2.You can remove it safely by cutting it using nail cutter or using scissors.3.To avoid pain, do not pull this skin out.Cut those portion that projects outwards.4.Keep the wounded region gently under flowing water, preferably under a tap. It may sting a little.5.After making sure that the dirt in the wound is gone, use cotton to clean and dry the wounded region. Make sure you remove every drop of water that is stuck inside the wound.6.Use cotton and medicated gauge tape to wind over the injury to a fastened dressing.By the term cotton, here I meant sterile cotton that we can see in first aid box or that we can get from medical store, it does not stick to your wound, instead absorbs any water that is left inside.You can reduce the impact of the pain with these steps, even though it is quoted:Wounds always hurt, but the degree of pain will vary according to the nature, location, and severity of the injury. Burns are particularly painful, as are many blisters, cuts, and scrapes.But if the wounds appears to be serious or deep, try not to tamper with it. Consult a doctor as soon as possible.
How to sterilize/clean a cut/abrasion without causing pain
Wounds by nature will hurt but we should not make them hurt more than needed when trying to clean them. Any rinsage with irritating substances such as alcohol or soap not only cause pain but they will also lead to additional tissue damage.In addition we should not introduce bacteria to the wound by using any non-sterile compound, including water, cloth, and our fingers.Let it bleedBleeding is nature's way to flush out dirt and debris. So if we let our wound bleed for a while we can almost be sure that most if not all dirt was removed as well.Remove larger dirt particlesOf course we may have to remove larger dirt fragmenst from abrasions or cuts. This can be done with a pair of sterile forcepts (e.g. sterilized with a lighter flame) or a sterile piece of cloth. For splinters see this question.If we do not have any such tools we may use our fingers for larger particles but we'd have to be extra careful to clean them before we touch anything. Use soap and alcohol on your hands - rather than on the wound.Only rinse the wound with clean (!) water in case you can't remove the dirt otherwise.Disinfect the woundIt may help avoiding an infection to disinfect a wound with a disinfectant. Avoid alcohol-containing preparations, as they hurt more than help. For me a water-based povidone iodine preparation was the least painful to apply (avoid those that also contain alcohol in their ingredients). Antibiotics should be reserved for cases where an infection had already taken place, and then you should definitely seek medical advice.Protect the woundAfter cleaning and applying desinfectant it is important to protect your wound from exposure to further environmental dirt. Use a clean band-aid for this. Change the bain-aid frequently.Seek medical adviceMost smaller bruises are self healing over time and do not need any professional intervention but we should see a doctor in the following cases:we are unsure about our last tetanus shotthe wound does not stop bleedingmoveability of a limb is tamperednumbness feeling distant to the woundgrowing pain, possibly accompanied by reddening and swelling.

How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?
I came here because there is a mosquito in my room that just attacked me and I've been walking around my room armed with a book and bug spray for the past 20 minutes trying to find it and it won't come out and fight like a man. I'm thinking do I open the door and let it fly out or is it too stupid to do that and if it is then what if more mozzies come in? I chose to keep the mozzie locked and I finally hunted the coward down and sprayed it with bug spray and IT DIED. Hunting Techniques:Weapons - books, spray, hands, electric bug killer, bug swat (usually when hunting mozzies I wack them with books and things that aren't mineLight - you need light for locating the trespassing mozzie. It is impossible to find them in the dark except if you listen to their buzzing but I find that creepy.Hope your mozzie gets the death penalty it DESERVES.

How do I redact information when my black marker isn't "wet" enough, and the information shows through my blackouts?
I've found very few markers are up to the task of blacking out printer ink, but worry not, there is another way! When most people think of redaction, they think of blacking out data, but I've found whiteout to be far more effective. Just whiteout the data you don't want to send, and all will be well. If you really want it to be black, first apply a coat of whiteout, then just mark over it with your marker. Like the OP mentioned, it's also not a bad idea to run the redacted version through a photocopier, as even with the original there are a number of ways to get ink to show through, but it's much harder on a photocopied version.
Is there a way that I will not get sleepy after lunch while on my job?
Basically it's due your digestion process, a lot of blood is pumped to the stomach area for digestive process, which causes the tiredness. Obviously, the heavier the meal the longer it'll take for your body to fully digest it, the longer you're gonna feel sleepy. Instead of having that particular ONE heavy meal, you can still eat the same amount throughout the day. Prepare snacks so when you get to lunch hour you don't eat as much as before yet you're still getting the same amount of food, just not all at once. 
How do I redact information when my black marker isn't "wet" enough, and the information shows through my blackouts?
Make a regular copy, then cut out the redacted information on the copy before you send it.
How do I redact information when my black marker isn't "wet" enough, and the information shows through my blackouts?
Put some opaque tape over the sensitive information before making your copy.  You could try masking tape or electrician's tape.  You might not want to use the auto paper feed on your copier because the tape might come off inside the copier.
How do I redact information when my black marker isn't "wet" enough, and the information shows through my blackouts?
If you are able to make copies of the forms, create a digital copy instead. Then you can "black out" the information digitally with any photo editor or your favorite PDF software. Replace the target text with a black box or just remove it completely. Then reprint the redacted copies as needed.Bonus that you're not destroying the original.
How do I redact information when my black marker isn't "wet" enough, and the information shows through my blackouts?
You can obfuscate each character individually with a ballpoint pen. Make sure the ink is the same color as the ink you're obfuscating.  Then draw a shape over the top of each letter; I like using a figure "8" with an "X" through it. That will make every character look like every other character:  an "8" looks like an "E" and like an "F", and also a "9" and an "X" and a "0".DISCLAIMER: This isn't a perfect solution (obviously!). With enough time, someone could probably read all the information you tried to hide, especially if they used additional tools like chemicals, heat, high-res scanners, etc. But I've found that it's good enough for those day-to-day situations where you want to make it really hard to read certain text.
How can I stop my glasses from slipping down my nose?

How do I redact information when my black marker isn't "wet" enough, and the information shows through my blackouts?
Take a copy of the document, cut out the sections you want to redact. Put a blank sheet of paper behind it (optionally with black behind the holes, according to how you want the redacted sections to show), copy it again.Or, of course, a digital equivalent, which is to edit by placing plain blocks over the redacted sections (do not use blur tools), then print out.You can mess about with ink and whiteout and so on, and you can kind of squint at the result and think about whether or not you find it illegible. And you'll probably be right. But if you want to redact something, having in your pocket while the rest of the document is on the copier is the best way to be sure it doesn't somehow show through :-)Also be careful about the size of the sections you remove. For SSN they're all the same, so this tells the attacker nothing. For financial information, knowing the number of digits in a redacted number might be a close enough estimate for whatever purpose they had in mind (and the number of line-items on your tax return is also slightly sensitive). Therefore where possible remove the entire box, not just the part of it you used.

How do I remove hard-to-remove ink from my hands?
A product called Amodex is a favorite among fountain pen users and it works on a variety of inks. It was invented in the 1950s by a printer and was specifically designed for safe use on skin (its base is lanolin).For use on fabrics, though, one of the Carbona "Stain Devil"  spot treatments may be cheaper.  There are nine different formulations and the directions differ subtly, so sure to read carefully.Stain Devil #3 is the one optimized for inks.
How do I redact information when my black marker isn't "wet" enough, and the information shows through my blackouts?
Some copiers might have a mode for a pure black-and-white, non-halftone copy. Computer scanners nearly always have ("lineart mode"). If that is not available, physically cutting out the redacted information is definitely the safest way.
Alternative to White-Out
I've used three techniques in the past for this kind of thing.Wipe it off.  If the surface is relatively non-absorbant, then a wet-wipe should be able to lift the pen off.  I've saved miswritten birthday cards in the past this way.Abrasion.  If you're writing on unwaxed paper or card, and have used a biro instead of a fountain pen, you can (very carefully) scrape away the top layer of paper immediately where you have written on.  Use anything hard that won't leave a mark, and go slow!  The ink will be removed with the top layer.  Practice this technique before using on something important!Paint.  If you have access to a decent painting set, you can effectively make your own White-Out in whatever colour you need.  Ideally, you need acrylics - it'll give you an finish very similar to White-Out.  Water colours won't cut it.If you use one particular colour often, consider investing in a POSCA paint marker.  They come in a large range of colours, and will allow you to effortlessly cover over any mistakes as easily as White-Out.

Remove Ink That's Scribbled on top of Printed Text?
Heat alone can vanish some kinds of normal, non-disappearing ink. Carefully warm up the paper over a stable candle and see if it works for the particular ink used.Another option is to scan the document at high resolution (before or after other treatments such as heat or chemicals), and examine it in image editing software. With some basic knowledge of image filtering and level adjustments, you can often extract information that was hidden before—the idea is to find the subtle difference between the covered text and the plain paper, that you can adjust to increase the contrast between them.Let's say the hidden text is just slightly darker. If you pick a brightness level that is between the two, and adjust the image to make all brightness values above that level white and all brightness levels below that value black, the original text can be discerned. Differences in color or any aspect could be the trick for restoring enough of the original text to read it.I have done something quite similar with old receipts that had lost their ink by sitting in the car on hot days for too long. After scanning at high resolution, simple adjustment of the levels, contrast, brightness, and so on, restored the image enough for me to see the original text, despite it being so faint that I could not read it from the original paper even with a magnifying glass.
How can I work out my girlfriend's ring size, without asking her or using a ring?
Have you considered that if she doesn't wear rings, a ring might be a poor gift?  Okay, if you're about to propose, then carry on.  Get a ring that's too small (size 5 or 6 is a good guess) and the jeweler will generally resize it for free.Always go too small -- avoids the whole "You think I'm fat!" series of difficulties.
How can I work out my girlfriend's ring size, without asking her or using a ring?
You can compare your fingers with her maybe your smallest one would be like her suitable finger. Or If you wear a ring you can try to put it in her finger and see the difference
How can I work out my girlfriend's ring size, without asking her or using a ring?
Ask Her Best Friend or MotherEspecially if this is an engagement situation, ask her best friend or her mother if they know her ring size. If you've been dating seriously for awhile, you'd be surprised how often this type of thing comes up. If neither of them know her ring size, they will likely be more than happy to get in on the intrigue. They can (more easily than you) find out her size under the guise of buying a gift or some other type of conversational pretense like "damn, you really need to know such things just in case, y'know?" Of course, all oaths of secrecy apply.The Solo ScenarioIf you decide to go with this on your own — when you are buying a ring from a jeweler, you typically buy the ring in their "standard" size; I believe it is usually a size 7. Display case rings are typically made a bit larger by design because they want a prospective buyer to be able to see it on their finger; that plus it is typically less destructive to resize the ring smaller than to try and make it bigger later. Ask the jeweler about the design of the ring and if knowing the ring size is more or less important than sizing it later. If the shank is plain (the part that wraps around the bottom), re-sizing is easy. If it's too big, they simply slice out a small portion at the bottom and join the ends seamlessly. If it's too small, the metal can be heated and stretched, but the thickness of the band will determine how much they can size it before more material has to be added. Adding material can leave a slight line between the old and new metal, so it is better get the bigger ring. If the ring shank is more ornamental (encrusted with diamonds or something), the ring size is sometimes best known before the ring is even made. That may be a factor in your decision about which ring to purchase. Ask the jeweler.

Play the "How well do we know each other?" GameFind one of those "how well do you know your partner" quizzes on the Internet1. Make sure the quiz is something you can download and print out. But before you print it, insert your own question asking what your partner's ring size is. Make sure the tone of the rest of quiz matches that type of question so it sort of blends in with the rest. Longer quizzes will incur less scrutiny on its contents.The "I don't know" ContingencyIf she doesn't know the answer to her ring size, act surprised. Amazed even. "I thought everyone knew their ring size!"Then bring it up again very matter-of-factly later. You can have a high school ring or something stashed away in the closet somewhere; preferably too small for you (borrow one from a friend if you have to and have it measured by a jeweler). "Here, try this. It doesn't fit me anymore, but I think it's a size 5 (or whatever) … Okay, there ya go." And then drop it. If the ring fits, you'll know the size. If it's a bit too big or a bit too small, you're in the right ballpark. You can try on some ring sizers later at the jeweler to narrow down (on yourself) just how much the ring size seemed too big/small on her finger earlier.Corny, but it will get you in the right ballpark.(1) Of course, I bear no responsibility for injury (emotional or physical) for having failed any relationship quiz recommended herein.
Diesel fuel smell out of clothing?
What you're smelling is diesel fuel that's remaining in the fabric after all your attempts to remove it.  This occurs because the hydrocarbon fuel has bonded to the synthetic fabric (effectively a finely spun plastic).  You need something that will loosen the bond between the fuel and the synthetic material, and there might not be such a substance that won't also damage the gloves.If you're willing to accept the (slight, IMO) possibility of the gloves being damaged, you could try soaking them in rubbing alcohol or denatured ethanol (what the British call methylated spirits).  I suggest this because those alcohols are solvents for all non-cyclic hydrocarbons, and shouldn't damage most synthetic fabrics.  I warn you because, depending on the denaturing agent used, denatured ethanol might damage the fabric or leave a different odor (ethanol is denatured by adding gasoline, in at least some parts of the USA).

How can I work out my girlfriend's ring size, without asking her or using a ring?
I had a ring custom made recently and was told it is easier to size a ring up than down. So don't get one too big! My advice is, don't get her a ring. 1. If it's "just a ring" not an engagement ring, she may be confused and either disappointed or scared off depending on how she feels about an engagement. If it is an engagement ring, consider that she will wear this every day and may want a say so in what it looks like. Instead, why not buy her a diamond or other stone. You can get it in a holder that looks sort of like a ring and comes in a ring box. You provide the rock and let her decide on the setting!
How can I work out my girlfriend's ring size, without asking her or using a ring?
The cunning plan I devised was to get buy my (then) girlfriend a cheapish ring, and give it to her as a anniversary/christmas/birthday gift.Which would have annoyed her quiet significantly, with her being disappointed that it was not engagement ring. But she would have forgiven me.Then if it was the wrong size, take her to the jeweller to get the cheapish ring resized. and make sure the jeweller would take note of the new size.Which I would then use to get the engagement ring to give her a month or so later.Before I could swing my cunning plan into action, she took me aside, gave me a plastic ring that fit her, and told me basically: "You are going to ask me to marry you; and if you don't do it by the 29th of February, there will be trouble."Still I maintain my plan would have worked.Congratulations BTW.
How can I work out my girlfriend's ring size, without asking her or using a ring?
Buy yourself a simple ring for some pretended reason.(Go to a fantasy store, buy it in a thrift shop, whatever seems reasonable for you to do).The best scenario would be, if she is with you when you buy the ring, so you can take another smaller ring and jokingly say this one would fit you.Otherwise find a chance to let her try it on.If it fits (which I doubt), perfect.Otherwise you have an idea on how much smaller the ring should be.

How can I work out my girlfriend's ring size, without asking her or using a ring?
I ran through various options before I proposed last year, and none of the standard advice worked (measure a known-good ring, ask a friend...)I went with: wait until she is tired and drunk, absent-mindedly play with a bit of string, wrapping it around fingers and so on, and just happen to score the string with my thumbnail when it's on the right finger.Mirabile dictu, it worked and she didn't notice. Not sure if I'd recommend it in general, though.
Does saliva really stops bleeding bruises/wounds?
Not really - there are a couple of things in saliva which promote blood clotting, and other ingredients which may block infection, but it depends what bacteria are already in your saliva as to whether infection will be blocked or, in fact, introduced to the wound, see info in link (http://www.bidmc.org/YourHealth/Holistic-Health/Health-Myths-Center.aspx?ChunkID=157011)When you wound yourself, the body produces an enzyme called thromboplastin within the wound, which promotes blood clotting by converting the prothrombin already present in the damaged area to thrombin in the early stages of the process, thus helping the blood to clot.The best way to stop bleeding is by applying pressure, and if you've knocked yourself without breaking the skin, preventing or lessening bruising can be achieved by applying pressure with an ice pack.

How to keep tobacco moist?
You need to use a piece of terra cotta. They sell them on amazon, etc. for use in brown sugar. When you get it, let it soak in water for about 30 minutes. Then pat the surface dry and throw it in with your tobacco (or "cilantro") and it should keep things moist for about 3 months. 
Alternative to White-Out
I have occasionally used fingernail polish.  It will go on the same way as White Out. You can also get non-gloss (matte) finishes so that your repair doesn't show as much.As a side bonus, if the polish color doesn't match the paper color, you can use it to make art on the page.  This will make it look like you decided to do artwork in the middle of the writing areas (camouflage).
How to avoid paper sticking together in a printer?
Just before printing, remove the paper from the printer and fan it to prevent the paper from sticking. One of the sources I reviewed said that in an arid environment, fanning could cause sticking due to a build up of static electricity.Grab one end of the paper with one hand. Grab the opposite side with the other hand. Bend the paper (without causing damage) so that an arch is formed. Using your thumb (either hand will work for this), release that side so that the paper is allowed to separate.Image from Lexmark

How can I neatly eat messy food without "common" utensils?
If you like to eat using your hands and not by using any utensils or accessories like spoons and gloves, and if you are only bothered about getting your hands 'sticky' while doing it, I suggest you to evenly apply some natural coconut oil to your hands before touching any sticky food. This will prevent your hands getting sticky while handling any food. It is obvious that you will be ingesting a bit of coconut oil along with your food and be glad you are doing it, as it is very good for your health and it also does a damn good job in keeping your skin moisturised.
Lifehacks to put an end to procrastination
You cure yourself of procrastination by changing how you think about the task, and about yourself. Important tasks are daunting. What's really that important? And you...you don't have to be a procrastinator. Brainwash yourself to change. Each morning write ten times: I am eager to get going on my tasks. This works best with several cups of coffee. Then jump right up and get started!
Lifehacks to put an end to procrastination
One thing to try is the Pomodoro Technique.  This is a way to get started and focused.  Often getting started is the issue, once the ice is broken you often find yourself in the flow.  Works for me, but you have to avoid distraction for those 25 mins.Another technique if you are facing a large amount of work, is to break it down into chunks, and just commit to completing one chunk at a time.  It's easier to move a brick at a time rather than trying to lift the entire wall.
How can I work out my girlfriend's ring size, without asking her or using a ring?
If you want to completely minimize the risk of her suspecting you're buying a ring, you can get a rough idea just by holding her hand and trying to remember how it feels.  Then compare that sense impression against your sister, mother, friends, your own fingers (pinky, perhaps?) and those of the ring salesperson.Err on the size of being too big.  If she says yes, at least you won't draw blood cramming it onto her finger. Then get it resized as necessary. If all else fails she can wear it on a chain around her neck until it's resized. Maybe you should carry a chain in your pocket when you propose, just in case?As pointed out in one of the comments, completely surprising her with the whole idea of getting married (rather than just the circumstances of when you'll ask) is not necessarily as good an idea as our romantic-fiction-driven ideals would lead us to believe.  Make sure you and she are on the same page about marriage, without necessarily making her certain whether/when you will propose. Also, if her parents are at all present/important in her life, make the effort to get their blessing before you propose. Their refusal won't make anything worse than it would end up being anyway, whereas their blessing will make everything much happier for all.Oh and one final note, having read one of the previous answers. If you surprise her a little, and you make it romantic, and you offer to devote the rest of your life to her, and while offering her a diamond ring to seal all of this you explain the very reasonable fact that you didn't know her ring size so it might be a little too big---if after all of that she looks at the size and scowls and says "oh, so you think I'm that fat??"---then, my friend, this is what you do:  marry someone else.

In ear headphones are painful to wear, increase comfort or convert to earbuds somehow?
Have you tried 3rd party memory foam tips like the ones from Comply? Also try in-ears with thinner nozzles and smaller driver housings, the Powerbeats2 nozzles look quite big.There are a few other companies making 3rd party tips for in-ears (including compatibility charts) and hearing protection. One of them should have enough expertise and a solution that works for you. The downside on foam tips though is that they will get worn out at some point.The Phonak Audéo PFE 1xx series had thin nozzles, a very slim driver housing and also came with a pair of Comply tips (medium size, but Comply also has smaller sizes and different shapes). Unfortunately Phonak decided to shut down its IEM business.Another alternative to look into are custom IEMs, which are expensive and usually bulky, but made to fit your ear. You should try to find out if the discomfort you are feeling is also related to the weight and size of the driver housing. My very cheap QCY QY7 look very awkward and heavy, but in the right position with foam tips I can wear them for a very long time with only negligible fatigue.
Spilled shampoo on floor and it has dried up
Wash with water. Blot dry. Repeat, repeat ad nauseam. Shampoo contains detergent, and from your description, " it made my hair dry," a lot of it. The good news is that plain water should completely remove the shampoo, other than any colorant, and that will be the cleanest spot on any floor, but the bad news is that even a bit of leftover detergent makes a lot of foam, and that every used towel must be washed. Murphy's Law Corollary, "Conservation of Filth: In order for something to get clean, something else must get dirty, [but] it is possible for everything to get dirty and nothing to get clean."If it's any consolation, spilled concentrated liquid laundry detergent requires more rinsing yet.

I would prefer you to apply some oil(hair oil) around the corners of the head phone so that it could easily fix into your ear and at the same time, it could not make discomfort.If you are not satisfied with this solution, you can opt for 3rd party tips as my friend has suggested here. 
Any idea how to remove this build-up from glass shower door?
From what I could see in a well focused portion of the image you had postedthere is a diffraction of light at the rims of the "stains". This would not be expected from ordinary limescale but indicates that the surface of your door was damaged.This may come from an aged surface coating or from acrylic glass of your door. This may also be the result of treating the coating, or acrylic glass with a cleaner capable of partly dissolving it.To avoid replacing the door we can hide the stains by applying a frosted or etched glass film. Transparency will be lost by this.

Any idea how to remove this build-up from glass shower door?
You can try stronger chemicals to remove the build-up of "lime" (most likely calcium carbonate). In any case, be sure the chemical stays in contact with scale for at least a few hours; use wet paper towels or a chemical gel that adheres to the glass. See some suggestions on how to remove it.Note that the following will damage marble, aluminum and other surface. In rough order of efficacy and of hazard to materials and health:Vinegar and/or citric acid (sour salt) are safe first steps, but takes a long while.CLR is a commercial product with gluconic and lactic acid that you may have tried. Again, keep it in contact long enough to work.Toilet-bowel cleaner with about 10% hydrochloric acid is hazardous to eyes, skin and mucous membranes, and will rapidly etch marble and some metal surfaces, but could be used over small areas.Finally, try elbow-grease: rub with an abrasive paste that is softer than glass, such as Bon Ami powdered cleaner. Your experiment at scraping off the lime shows that this should work.

Which is the best way to clean leather shoes?
I use a pumpkin based soap which is very effective with my leather shoes, I usually wax them after the washing procedure.

If you still find it hard to remove colour, you can surely use kerosene. It is used to remove hard colouring agents like paint that is used for colouring buildings.Procedure is as follows:1.Pour some drop of kerosene over your hand and rub firmly against each other.2.If colours are being removed, you can stop it over there and move to cleaning step.Otherwise you can use a small piece of cloth having rough surface and rub your affected area over it.3.The colour should actually go by this step.Cleaning steps:1.Do not waste the kerosene.You can collect it using a piece of cloth or paper and later use of for ignition in hearth.2.Wash your hands properly so that even the smell of kerosene should be gone.
How can I neatly eat messy food without "common" utensils?
Raise the plate instead of the foodThis is what I do when I want to eat something while sitting at my desk and using the pc, and I don't want to get my hands dirty:Put the food on a plate. Instead of raising the food to your mouth, you always raise the plate and eat the chips, fruit slices or whatever food out of the plate directly with your mouth.While you may not want to do this in public, at home this will works fine and your hands will never get dirty again.
How to re-form a bent paper clip?
Okay, so.Secretly, a metal is a set of grains of regular crystal lattices which are stuck together -- both internally and along grain-boundaries -- by "metallic bonds." Metallic bonds involve sharing electrons across the whole crystal, which is why metals conduct heat and electricity so well -- some of the electrons are somewhat free to bounce around the whole metal.When formed the grain boundaries form tight connections -- think of two surfaces that are flush next to each other. As you move them, mostly you stretch the individual grains via "elastic deformation", which returns roughly to the same place. But if you move it too far, grains "slide" along these boundaries and sometimes even "break" into two new grains, so that they don't return to the same place -- this is called "plastic deformation."Plastic deformation usually does a couple of things: it makes the thing more brittle so you have to handle it more gently before it will outright crack and break; and it makes the thing stiffer, so that you have to push it harder to move it the same distance. This happens because the grains are not as well-aligned as they used to be, there are now "gaps" between the grains, you've taken a subatomic harmony and created discord. Something microscopic has happened.So, if you just want to try to bend the paperclip back, you will need a combination of patience and luck, as you're going to be damaging the subatomic structure of the metal even more when you try to reverse it. You're not perfect and you can't perfectly undo the damage you did. So be as gentle and precise as possible and maybe you can get some approximation of the original, but the damage will remain inside that metal lattice.The only good way to repair this subatomic damage is called annealing. It is a really easy idea in principle: raise the temperature of the object just shy of its melting point, so that it doesn't lose its apparent structure but all of the grains are beginning to flow into each other, then let it slowly cool down. The speed at which it cools down will control the size that the new grains can grow -- if you immediately dump it into cold water, for example, then the random vibrations of the atoms will immediately get "frozen" with very small couple-of-atom grains with a lot of random distances between them, which will be very brittle and stiff. But if you try to cool it down as slow as possible, the grains will get very large and connect over very flat surfaces, so it will be much more ductile and supple, healing the damage you've done.You may be able to achieve these results with a gas flame -- propane and butane typically burn just under 2000°C, most steels melt somewhere higher at 2500°C. If you really want to do this, a good crucible would help; you can put the paperclip in the crucible, heat the crucible up to around 2000°C for a few minutes, and then put the crucible on a wire cooling rack; then as the crucible gently cools the paperclip will hopefully be able to repair some of this microscopic damage -- the more the heat capacity of the crucible, and the worse that it's capable of radiating heat, the slower that paperclip will cool down and the more damage that can be healed. 
How can I remove scratches/ coating from my LG mobile camera lens
If it is a new mobile and you recently bought it, I suggest you to take it to the service center. Any stunt you may pull may result in breaking your warranty or guarantee. If the guarantee/ warranty period is over, then what you've heard is an acceptable method to clean camera lenses. Toothpaste can be used. But be careful to follow the correct steps. Try this link. However, I advice you not to go ahead with it unless you are certain and very confident. Any actions you perform is strictly under your own responsibility and nobody else will take liability for your actions. So be very careful. Cheers
How can I remove scratches/ coating from my LG mobile camera lens
The standard first rule of cleaning optics is: Don't!Cleaning with an abrasive like toothpaste is far more likely to render the lens evenly "milky" due to putting fine scratches all over it.  Further, the "lens" you can touch is actually an optical flat cover that protects the actual lens, and in many phones and tablets it's made of synthetic sapphire -- so the only thing likely to be scratched, or vulnerable to your polishing attempts (short of using powdered diamond on an optical lap) is the coating.It's unlikely that any photo quality issues you may see are due to individual scratches on the cover, in any case; it's far more likely that the focusing mechanism (probably a piezoelectric unit behind the sensor chip) is malfunctioning, a setting in the camera software is wrong, or there's junk on the sensor itself.TL:DR; you're more likely to make it worse than better if you try to polish the lens cover.
How do I stop/discourage people from stealing from my car?
One way is by removing the steering wheel and keeping it under the seat or somewhere out of sight. Should discourage potential car thieves. Or you could put a sticker which says "Govt of...." so it seems like a VIP's car.
How do I stop/discourage people from stealing from my car?
Put a motion sensor and have it trigger the car alarm.  This should deter anyone who is attempting to steal from your car.  Also, it might be a good idea to not have anything "custom" or special on the car.  A motion capture camera (like a game camera) would be good.  But then the question arises, how to secure that without it being stolen?.....

What are inexpensive ways to send wedding invitations?
It really depends how original you want to be, but if you want an invitation that will be zero cost to you, find yourself a friend who knows about video editing and make a video invitation; then you just proceed to send it through e-mail or a hyperlink. Several years ago, one of my friends did his in flash, turned out pretty neat. 
What are inexpensive ways to send wedding invitations?
In this time of social media and internet this gives you an advantage of having almost anything at your finger tips. Some inexpensive ideas: Facebook or social media. You can make a cute image or video and send it all the people invited. Plus, it's free and almost instantaneous. You can also have them message you back so that you know that they got it. Also, text message(which is pretty cheap). But like the other answer mentioned e-mail is probably better. Some better ideas if you have time is to make your own or shop online for stationary. Online is uasully cheaper. You can print them up and tie them with ribbon or beads. But whatever corners you cut, people may look down on it as you being cheap. 
Windshield wipers freezing During Freezing Rain
Sticking them straight out works good in snow and ice rain, but is best when used with a towel, socks on the wipers or other waterproof cover. Ice getting into their joints stops them from working and can be a problem even if they are sticking straight out. Spraying something on the windshield works even better with this. White vinegar is suppose to limit the amount of ice that builds up, but I fail to see how this would be useful in vigorous rain. There are products built for this and if used liberally then they do work. This SE question gives some good feedback: http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/5521/should-i-pull-my-wipers-away-from-the-windshield-when-parked-during-a-winter-sto#Putting a tarp over the car helps and there are pegs created to stop them from sticking to sticking to the window shield. 
What are inexpensive ways to send wedding invitations?
Hand letter your invitations with a good ink. It takes time and effot and is as luxurious as you can get this day and age. Get some nice cardstock to write on and use ink that has a color quality that is hard to replicate in a office printer. It is a lot of work and most people can not afford the time and effort to do 120 of these. The other is to print the invitations yourself. Again if you use some textured, and thicker paper/card stock then this will look better. Just make sure to use the best printer you have access to. The key here is to test your materials on first, to avoid surprises. Printing on textured paper does not allways work out. Also you need to know what side the printer prints on and how to use the direct feed input* etc. Quality is often just simply a function of how much time and effort your willing to take to execute your work. Take your time and test things on screen and make prototypes, test your materials, sample and shop around. People want to see effort, that is what luxury is about.Other ideas:It is possible to make/buy ready made dies to cut specific shapes into the invitation. Or you can cut material out of a different stack and glue it on top.If you have access to a maker fab you could use a laser cutter to engrave plastic or cut vinyl transfers. (I am in Finland and maker fabs are available in at least 6 local libraries within 30 minutes of travel. A vinyl cutter and some time can take you very far.)Image 1: Scissors for decorative border.* Many printers have a separate indeed in the back to avoid bending card stock. Note that the printer often needs to be configured for the thicker medium.

Improved street lightinghttp://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/people/academic_research/david_farrington/lightsw.pdfIt's a fairly well known effect that improving the street lighting reduces crime quite significantly. If you can't get your local council (or equivalent other) to improve the lighting quality in your area, try putting up motion sensitive lights outside your house that include the parking area. Encourage your neighbours to do the same and you'll end up with the whole street lighting up every time someone moves around at night.
Any idea how to remove this build-up from glass shower door?
I use vinegar to remove such stains.   Also, on glass you might try using a razor blade scraper.  I have a mirror hanging in the shower, and once every few months I just use the razor blade to slice off the built up lime.  I push the blade forward (it's in a holder) and peel off the build-up, and then wash it with vinegar.  
Any idea how to remove this build-up from glass shower door?
Have you tried looking at a product called "Glass Rescue"? I saw it in a youtube video and they say it works for hard stuck-on glass stains. Maybe you can give that a try if abrasives and other solutions don't work!I personally haven't tried it, as my bathrooms don't have glass doors.

Some woman use:cucumber carrotsmall eggplantwith a condom over it or without but wash it first. However these are not much reusable.You can think of some small plastic/glass items to use instead:small bottle (makeup bottle of mascara or other with smooth surface)toothbrush or hairbrush handleDo not use beer bottle or other bottle from the side with the opening, it may be dangerous if low pressure occur, it will be difficult to remove.As a common tool is described the handheld shower head and the waterjet it makes. It is used by many, because of its accessibility. Andyou can use it in a place where it is normal to be naked.Another tool to use is a personal massager like the Hitachi MagicWandI think whatever you use must keep it clean or you may have problems with bacteria (some kind of infections). And also be careful with glass items not to break them.

What is the best way to re-dry already seasoned firewood
The moisture from your car is probably too little and it can't affect the wood. You have to check if the roof is leaking water or the floor is wet. If the floor is wet then water may be coming from outside. In this case you should dig a small channel around the garage, which will help to drain water and don't let it go inside.Also you need good ventilation to dry the wood. Here are some ways to store wood:We store our wood for burning outside, covered with a plastic sheet to protect it from the rain and snow. It is covered only at the top and the sides are open for air circulation.Some people make a firewood shed which have a roof, but is opened on the sides.For wood which is wet a firewood dryer can be used. Most simple ones have a transparent plastic sheet covering the wood which lets the sun warm the air inside and holes for letting in dry air and another one to take out the wet air. More complex variant have a fan which improves the air circulation.
How can I get rid of the tiny fish-bone stuck in my throat upon eating fish?
I just been through the 'horrowing' experience. Anxiety, Nervous and Panicking are the usual enemies when we caught under the situation. I tried everything according to the old teachings and methods but to no avail. Allow me to share some of my technique just in case you are running out of time but still feeling reluctant to consult doc. First of all try settle down for a day if you have failed to withdraw the bone. Secondly you need to know the sensation of the bone hanging in your throat or beneath your tonsil or underneath the tongue. Well it can be everywhere. Get some rough estimation. Trust me, no one knows better where the bone stuck rather than our ownselves. Even doc sometimes can't locate the bone and forced to use anesthetic. Once you have settled down and had a great feeling that's the right spot, you need to find a plastic spoon and wooden chopstick to locate the bone real carefully. Use the plastic spoon holder to press on your tongue in order for you to search through your throat. You should able to control how deep reaching the end of the tongue as it's quite irritating and the feeling of 'puking'. If you let others or even a general doctor, they might probably mess up the process, which of course I did and not even a doctor who able to make it. So you need to take charge. Look at the mirror and use your mobile phone Torchlight to ease your operations. Back to the tools, well now you know the plastic spoon function, use the chopstick to slowly open up your tonsils which located within the surrounding of your tongue. It's a very useful tool but you must do it real carefully not to hurt yourself. Lastly, please remember this and it's quite important. The spot or stucking sensation in your throat may not be the exact spot. Throat created different and unique feeling and makes you believe that the bone was hanging there which it may be the opposite side. Remember this always, when you can't locate the bone where you have a strong feeling it's there. You need to try the opposite side, up down, left right. Open up your 4 tonsils or throat via chopstick. A few flicks, you may successfully pick out the bone. I am just sharing and if you think your case is more severe,  you have no choice but to check with ENT specialist. Dentist can't do much either. And if you decided to check with ordinary surgeons, I would suggest that you try on the method. I wish you all the best. Pls do not do this without the consent and supervision by the adults. And don't try this at home especially if you are not ready or equip with skills. Consult your doctors for proper medication.   
How would you sharpen nasal scissors?
I've figured it out! For anyone who's curious, here's how to sharpen nasal scissors.You will need: 1. a sort-of-rough edge (the glass panel of a modern digital weighing scale did the trick for me)something to test the scissors on (preferably not nasal keratin. I used cardboard rolls)Firstly, check your scissors and note the which side the cutting edge is facing. Most scissors have a small slope. This is the part we want to sharpen, as this is used for cutting.Next, press the sloping edge to the surface you intend to use for sharpening. It may be better to use the corner of the surface. With medium force, press the scissor edge to the surface and pull downwards for about five to ten centimetres.Repeat for the other cutting edge on the scissors, and test the sharpness. If necessary, repeat the above steps, though one run was enough for me.

Safe Alternatives to Dildos
Before answering this, I think it should be known that nothing is a full-proof safe alternative to a dildo. You should also know that anything other specifically a sex toy comes with inherent risk.Next, let's clear something up. Anal matters greatly more than vaginal. The reason is because it is much easier to lodge or even lose an object in your anus. Your vagina is a canal:Things won't get lost up there, but that's not to say you want to let full objects become engulfed (they would need to be small, your vagina isn't very deep, but it's possible).You asked for an ideal safe household object (under the circumstances). This is my recommendation for the anus and vagina:There are no chances this will be lost in the anus, because the top is stopping it. Depending on the type of hairbrush, some handles may be better than others (less rigid, etc).Remember, as I said in the beginning, nothing is fully safe. An example of something that could go wrong with a hairbrush would be a cracked plastic handle. That could be dangerous, clearly. Check the item yourself first!Remember:Never use glass bottles (this should be obvious)Never use anything that you can't get a good hold ontoDon't use anything wood, you wouldn't want it to splint during use. This includes wooden hairbrushes.

How to clean urine stain out of a bed mattress
Febreze works well at removing all kinds of odors, for example hockey equipment, which tends to really reek after a sweaty session on the ice. There are specific types aimed at pet odor, such as urine stains on carpet, not expensive at all, especially compared to a new mattress. If it's the visual stain that bothers you, maybe you could try an oxy cleaner. Or flip the mattress and forget about it for a while. Fortunately, infants and small children don't have particularly strong smelling urine.

How to clean urine stain out of a bed mattress
Most HE laundry detergents also contain enzymes that would eliminate the stain and smell, but you would need to scrub repeatedly with plain water to remove the detergent (it can be irritating if left in the mattress).You might use a pet stain remover, such as this product at Amazon, though you can probably find the equivalent at a local supermarket or pet store. 
How to pick up fallen apples quickly?
All apple trees that grow in a residential neighborhood get overgrown. The fallen apples are messy. A good idea is to plant a new hardwood tree next to the apple tree. When the new tree needs more room to grow bigger, you can cut down the messy apple tree & remove the stump. Install topsoil, seed, and you're done.
Bedtime remote tied to wrist to mute/shut down computer
There are a few possible solutions for this.You could download the audio (or the full videos) from YouTube using several browser extensions.  (I will assume there is no copyright on these videos.)  Then copy the videos to an mp3 player or cell phone and listen to it within easy reach (headphones optional).  In addition, VLC and some other audio apps allow you to turn on a sleep timer so that they will shut themselves off after an amount of time you choose.  This puts the videos or music close at hand, and lets you just go to sleep without turning it off; it will shut off by itself.As an alternative, there are small "mini keyboards", usually with trackpads built in, that are used for home media centers.  These are more convenient than a wireless keyboard.  Also you could use a computer media player with a sleep timer built in (VLC or others should work on the desktop as well) so you don't need to worry about it.  Then just have your computer go into sleep mode or shut off after 10 minutes of inactivity.  You can go to sleep and the machine will go quiet then shut off on it's own.
Measuring my altitude above sea level accurately
Easy, get the height between ground level and your eye (suppose you got6 feet). hold a torch or any light source on your head as shown.stay away 40 feet from the building.see the building as mid    eye sight.get the distance between you and light reflection on    the ground and reduce 6" (distance of torch and your eye)( suppose    you got 2 feet)do the simple calculation. -> (6/2)*(40+2) = 126    feet high building.
How to remove wax from woolen clothes?
Usual method to remove wax is to try to pick or peel off as much as possible, and then get some blotting paper or a couple of sheets of absorbent kitchen paper and a hot iron. Place the paper over the wax, and apply the hot iron to the paper - the trouble is, your jumper is wool, and that doesn't take too much of a high temperature, so its a bit of a risk. You need to melt the wax through the paper, which then absorbs it...without burning the sweater.

You don't mention what OS you're running?Look for "media centre" remotesThis one from the list you supplied should do the jobI've been using a Microsoft Media Centre remote in a similar situation for years (it's a WinXP MCE remote). Altho' with these remotes it makes them a lot easier to use if you run Media Centre software on your PC (software dedicated to playing music, videos, etc), some of these have YouTube plugins.If your running Windows there's also a program I use called AMP WinOff that works with all versions of windows that I've tried, although it can be a bit hit & miss in Win10. Great program that will switch your PC off for you with a lot of different options, one of which has a timer that resets after user input (I usually watch a series of 25min videos, use the remote to skip credits which WinOff automatically picks up & restarts the 30min timer. Unless I'm asleep of course).
How to make cyanoacrylate glue (super glue) not stick to skin?
Look for a product (likely in auto parts stores) generically called "barrier cream" -- it's a cream that's labeled to be used in place of gloves.  It keeps oils and grease off your skin, but washes off easily and cleanly when you're done with your job.  What they don't tell you on the package is that it will also keep cyanoacrylate glue from contacting and bonding to the skin (though it might cure on the surface of the barrier cream), and will allow wiping or washing the film of cured glue off along with the barrier.Do beware, however, that the barrier cream, if not fully dried on your skin, might transfer to your work piece(s) and prevent the CA glue from bonding where you want it to!  To avoid this, either handle the parts with clean tools (pliers, tweezers, etc.), or handle them with great care to avoid contacting the surface area with your protected fingers.That said, I used to use thin CA to harden balsa sheet (skin on a model airplane frame), and spread it with my unprotected fingertips.  I never had a problem with bonding to the work or finger to finger (because I kept my fingertips moving until the glue had finished curing), and the cured glue peeled off my fingers fairly readily without requiring debonder or acetone -- however, my skin is fairly oily, and I realized years later that skin oils on my fingertips (from touching my face, since fingertips typically don't exude oil) were likely protecting my fingers from effective bonding.  So, if you don't have or can't get barrier cream, you may be able to avoid skin bonding by coating your fingertips with oil (cooking oil should work as well as skin oil, and may be easier to get if your skin is drier than mine).  Same cautions apply about transferring the oil to the surface that's to be bonded, of course.
How can I transport a book in a backpack without getting the corners bent?
I have used cereal or granola bar boxes and cut the ends off of them. Many of the larger snack boxes are bigger and you can fit a few books in there. They don't last a terribly long time, as they themselves get banged up (instead of your books!) but they are cheap and easy to replace! You can tape them with duct tape for higher durability.

Remove Broken Lightbulb from holder
Make sure there is no power going to the light, and use a potato.  Cut it in half, jam it in and twist(unscrew) to remove.
Remove Broken Lightbulb from holder
If you can't be sure which switch position turns off the socket (say, with a double switch that lets you control the light from two locations), locate and shut off the breaker for that circuit, or remove its fuse -- or if a lamp, unplug the cord.The potato trick works well as long as there's glass left on the socket (the potato needs to be big enough to catch on the broken glass attached to the base).  If there's no glass left, but the central insulator post is intact, I've successfully removed the broken bulb by carefully gripping the internal glass insulator and using it to twist out the base (gloves highly recommended to protect your fingers in case the insulator breaks), or used small-nosed pliers to grip the edge of the base (which protrudes a few millimeters above the socket) and unscrew the base.
Remove Broken Lightbulb from holder
TURN OFF THE POWER FIRST!!!Put the jaws of pliers into the socket and force the handles apart to grip the inside of the socket.  Turn the pliers to back out the bulb.If the friction is not strong enough to turn the base of the bulb, you can wrap the jaws with a rubber band first.
How to clean urine stain out of a bed mattress
Nature's Miracle and other pet stain removers work quite well at removing urine smells. It's an enzymatic cleaner that works best if you use it before you use any other cleaners. My sister used it on her car seat after her child had an accident in the car and it worked quite well.Also, home carpet cleaning companies have access to professional chemicals and extractors that may do an even better job than common home products.

Screw is rusted to the point that it is completely rounded off. How to remove?
Using a hand-held grinder or rotary tool, you could grind a slot in the screw head and then use a flat blade driver to remove.
Remove Broken Lightbulb from holder
Isolate the power to the circuit at the fuse box/consumer unit/breaker panel/whatever your country calls it first. DO NOT rely on lightswitches to isolate the power. If you know what other things are on the same circuit then you can use them to double check that the circuit is off. If you have a non-contact voltage detector you could use that to double check.Make sure the circuit will not be turned back on. In a commercial situation I would want to see a lockout. With my own family I consider telling them not to turn the circuit back on to be sufficient.Then use pliers to remove the remains of the bulb from the socket. Ideally these pliers would have approved insulated handles but at the very least you should ensure you don't touch any metal parts of the pliers during the work.A good rule of thumb in life is to try and make sure that wherever possible you are at least two failures or screwups away from danger. Hence why you should isolate the power AND use insulated tools.
Screw is rusted to the point that it is completely rounded off. How to remove?
You can drill out the old screw. You should use a center punch to insure that you place your drill bit in the middle of the screw.If the old screw head is completely rusted, you can just remove the head of the screw (again by drilling it) so that nothing is holding the base of the fixture to the ceiling.
Screw is rusted to the point that it is completely rounded off. How to remove?
If any of the head or shaft of the screw is visible, you may be able to grip it tightly with pliers (or a vise-grip) and unscrew it. If you try this, don't apply too much torque as the rusted screw may break off.
Bedtime remote tied to wrist to mute/shut down computer
Listen to the YouTube videos or playlists with your cell phone instead of your computer. You can take it into bed with you. To improve the sound quality, if that's a factor, buy some speakers or use headphones. When you are nearly asleep, just press the button on your phone that shuts it off. That button should be just as simple as the button on a remote, but even more familiar.
Screw is rusted to the point that it is completely rounded off. How to remove?
Drilling or grinding the head off is probably your best bet as mentioned by others, but here are a couple more options.If there's enough of the screw exposed you can try cutting a slot across the top so that you can use a flat screwdriver on it. If it sticks out enough you can use a hacksaw, otherwise something like a dremel with a thin grinding blade.There are tools specifically for removing damaged screws. From the picture your screws might be too small for it, but it's worth considering. Here's the first one I found when I duckduckgo-ed screw removal tool.Whatever you do, give it some lubricating spray like WD40 etc. beforehand, and let it soak in for a bit. This will help free it up and make the job easier.

How to clean floor if there is cooking-oil spilled on it?
Cheaper and most used approach:Take all the excess oil from the floor to a vessel using a paper-napkin or spoon.Spread flour (available in each kitchen) on the oily part. Rub the flour on the oily parts (it will even go through tiny lanes if any on the floor) till the floor gets dry.Collect the flour using vacuum cleaner and use soap and sponge to clean the floor.Cheers
How to use the smallest piece of soap for bathing?

For many years, I've opened a new bar when the old one got too small -- and, after washing (with both bars wet) pressed the new bar onto the old one.  They'll dry enough after the shower to cement together, and then the old bar and the new will handle as one bar.  No waste, no residue, no special handling needed.
How to stop snow from sticking to the shovel
Spray Rain-X on to the shovel before shoveling.
How to stop snow from sticking to the shovel
Snow sticks to the shovel because it melts on contact with the shovel blade.  This can be most easily prevented by keeping the shovel outdoors, so it's cold before you start shoveling the snow.  This will let the snow slide off the blade, without requiring waxing, oiling, etc.  As a bonus, it'll work equally well with a plastic or metal shovel blade.The only time this won't work is when the temperature outside is actually above freezing.  If that's the case, you could try spraying the blade with ether-based engine starting fluid; it will evaporate quickly even in very cold weather, chilling the shovel blade so it doesn't stick to the snow as badly, but in these conditions, there really isn't much you can do -- even a waxed or oiled blade will stick some.TL;DR  Keep the blade cold, below freezing.
How can I use an eraser without smudging?
I have found that (like your referenced article states) the better quality and more pliable erasers work better.  I also like to use short quick strokes.  I don't think that there is much that can be done for an eraser that has outlived it's shelf life.  Once it is smooth and glossy, it is time to get a new eraser.  I tried to "shave" one, but that did not provide any better results.
How can I use an eraser without smudging?
Big fan of pencils for both office & study as well as sketching & artwork. Different erasers are designed to work with your particular pencil and paper selection, so there are a few issues to consider. Graphite Hardness and ErasabilityAt the bottom of this post, I included a pencil grading test to show the effect of graphite hardness on how a pencil writes and erases. Generally speaking, softer leads are easier to erase, but they are also more prone to smudging (left-handed pencil users sometimes prefer harder leads for that reason). Harder H-grade leads are more smudge-resistant and give cleaner lines, but they tend to be more scratchy on the paper and are harder to remove once applied heavily enough to be easily legible. The sweet spot between legibility and erasability is somewhere around the HB to 3H range (HB is your #2 pencil in the U.S. grading system — Graphite Grading Scales Explained). 2H is dark enough to be read clearly with minimal smudging while being easier to erase and correct mistakes.Choosing a PencilThe Dixon Ticonderoga yellow #2 pencil has been the standard pencil of choice since our school days. But with three lead grades (B, HB, H) available, you may want to try a few different hardnesses to find the level that works best for you. But here is my top preference.Uni Mitsubishi 9850 Pencil with Eraser - HBMany die-hard pencil fans swear by the Uni Mitsubishi 9850 for its smooth, dark lines and general utility for office and study needs. What caught my attention was the high-quality eraser that erases pencil marks easily and reportedly does not harden (a leading cause of erasers becoming ineffectual over time). I found the eraser on this pencil surprisingly good and erases easily without smudges. Choosing an EraserThere is a lot of variability in eraser materials and effectiveness and what they are designed to erase. The most common pink variety (made of rubber) tend to smear and leave a residue while the pumice can be punishing to the paper (think math homework filled with holes). But if you want to stick to what you're going to find in your local grocery store, the Papermate pink erasers have gotten notably better in recent years. Just make sure you keep swapping them out for newer erasers, as older ones tend to dry out and lose their effectiveness egregiously. Erasers also come in soft vinyl (plastic), art gum, and kneaded erasers that absorb graphite rather than rubbing it away. I've been partial to gum erasers made for sketching and artwork, but I've been itching to try some of the newer plastics or even this battery-powered eraser that are reportedly extremely gentle on paper and meticulously exact. If you want to experiment with different materials, I would suggest the reviews at Guide to Choosing an Eraser… but if you want a one-stop solution, I would suggest the Uni Mitsubishi 9850 pencil I mentioned above. The pencil/eraser combination is surprisingly good. Precision Erasing 2.0You mentioned precision erasing to prevent you from losing entire lines when fixing up mistakes — from my aspiring graphic design and architecture days, I absolutely love these things:Product Search: Erasing ShieldsIt may be overkill for some, but I find them indispensable. Pencil Lead Hardness Test
How can I use an eraser without smudging?
The composition of the eraser does cause some differences in how the graphite is removed, but in general I've found that a dabbing twisting motion is best regardless of what the eraser is made of.I find soft putty erasers to be the best for soft pencils, and a hard grit eraser best for H4 and harder, but be gentle as it can shred the paper fibers.The Staedtler Mars Plastic is a good general purpose eraser, in my opinion.And as a final tip, keep the eraser clean: I find rubbing the built up graphite off with your thumb to be a good action prior to using it.

It depends on how secure it needs to be, if very high security is needed you must keep it in a safe, however this is expensive.A chest with a padlock is the next option but is still probably out of budget.If such security is overkill, use two pieces of plywood, sheet-metal or any other flat, strong material (can be scrap).Draw an outline of the notebook and use a large diameter drill to drill several holes in both pieces al around the outline.Thread the cable of a small bicycle lock through the holes all around the notebook.Out of the box solution:Use google drive.

How to remove armpit stains?
Just add some bleach to water and wash your shirts in that.
How to eliminate static-y hair?
I know you've accepted the answer, but preventing this problem is the sole reason I use fabric conditioner on laundry, otherwise, not only is my hair doing strange things, but my clothes are likely to stick to each other while I'm wearing them, and spark and crackle when I take them off... and fabric conditioner is what's in dryer sheets.
How to use the smallest piece of soap for bathing?
The simplest solution and perhaps the most obvious: Just stick the sliver to the bottom of your next bar. Use a bit of water to seal it. Nothing fancy here, but it totally works.Save the slivers up and then turn them into a brand new bar. Once you’ve collected enough scraps, you can reform them to create an entirely new mutant chimera bar. There are many different ways to do this, all of them relatively easy, each of which involves a slightly different technique. So Google around a bit and find yourself a well-rated recipe.Make a self-soaping cloth by wrapping a small assortment of soap scraps in a wash cloth, and tying it shut with a piece of string to create a sort of sachet. Keep it in the shower for quick and easy scrubbing action.Save your scraps and stuff them into the toe of an old pair of pantyhose, tie it up, and hang it near your outside faucet. This is a great way to guarantee you’ll have soap on-hand for when you’re finishing up a day in the garden, or doing some other outdoor dirty work. Bonus: Like the self-soaping wash cloth, the pantyhose will help to create a lather.You can also use this soap-on-a-rope trick to keep pests like deer away from your garden and fruit trees. As above, just drop a few soap slivers into the toe of an old pair of panty hose, tie it up, and hang it from whatever plant you’re trying to protect. The soapy smell will keep those critters away.Did you know you can make homemade laundry detergent? Place a collection of completely-dried soap scraps into a food processor and grind them to a crumbly powder. In a large bowl, combine 2 parts washing soda, 2 parts borax, and 1 part soap crumbles. Mix thoroughly and store in a mason jar. Use 2 tbsp per load of laundry.You can also turn your old bar soap scraps into brand new liquid hand soap. The process involves cooking down the soap with glycerin and essential oils. It's a bit more work, but it's a fun DIY project.  And finally, keep a sliver of soap in your sewing or craft kit. It’s perfect for scoring a seam or otherwise marking the fabric. Since the soap washes out so easily, it makes an ideal replacement for tailor’s chalk.
How to create lock on notebook?
You don't say what you consider expensive, but a quick search shows quite few locking notebooks that fall under $20 and some of them are less than $10.Product Search: Locking Notebooks under $20But if you're looking for a multi-use system (one that doesn't create an on-going expense when replacing each notebook), this notebook cover will allow you to lock up anything you put inside it.

How to remove wax from woolen clothes?
Place the garment in the freezer for an hour or two, remove and break the wax off the garment. I would go this route first before trying to heat the wax. Heating the wax seems like it would make it get into the fabric deeper, making it harder to remove.

How can I transport a book in a backpack without getting the corners bent?
I would take a few lengths of fabric (sewing) elastic and sew or glue them in a grid fashion to the side of the backpack that is along your back. The vertical strips should end a fa inches above the base of the backpack and all the strips should be far enough apart to allow the book to slide in with some stretching.

Preparing to have a cast put on; anything to do to preemptivly prevent scratching
Just like the other guys tell you, exfoliate. Also, go get baby powder. Usually it gets kinda hot and sweaty depending on the type of cast used. Keeping it dry in there will keep it from itching and smelling bad.
How to use the smallest piece of soap for bathing?
I collect the little slivers until there are a dozen or so of them. Periodically I grind up the slivers with a salad shooter or just grate them with a grater.  Then I cut the bottom off an oval plastic bottle to use as a soap mold.   Take the grated pieces and put them in the bottle bottom.  Add some water to the mix.  Then put it in the microwave --- about 10 to 15 seconds at a time.  The soap will begin to bubble and rise.  Take it out and tamp it down and replace in the microwave and repeat for another 10 seconds.  Do this a few times till the soap will tamp down and the air bubbles are removed (you may need to add a bit more water to get the proper mix).  Then put it all aside to dry out (about a week or so).  When it's dry, take it out of the bottle bottom, and let it dry out another week or so.  Then, use it.   I had about 30 bars of hotel soap collected over the years. I ground them all and made 5 larger bars of soap I'm currently using in the shower every day.  Works great.  
How to use the smallest piece of soap for bathing?
I lather the soap on my hands and then clean myself with them.  This is instead of trying to rub the bar on my body directly.
How to get rid of sorting and losing socks after laundry?
There are several options, but none of them come without a significant drawback. Buy socks with snap fasteners. Yes they sell things like that. They are expensive but usually of higher quality. After wearing put the pair together. Use a lot of those laundry bags which are normally used to protect bras and other sensitive textiles during laundry to presort your socks after putting them off. Those bags aren't very expensive, but you need as many as you have different socks. Dry them on a clothesline. This eases sorting a little, because you have a view on all of them at the same time. 
How to create lock on notebook?
Get a small padlock. Drill out or punch a hole through the notebook edge that is a bit bigger than the padlock's shank (the curving part, also called the shackle). You then can lock it at will. If you budget allows, two locks at the top and bottom corners will make the notebook almost impossible to peek into.This method will work if you leave reasonable margins at the edge of your pages, but will not necessarily be completely secure; the journal could still be opened by ripping the lock out of the paper. However, it will certainly discourage casual browsing, and you will know if somebody has broken in.Also, this is still likely to cost some money, but less than a special journal. Asking friends or family if they have a lock they aren't using could get you a free one. Luggage locks might be an ideal size.
How to get rid of sorting and losing socks after laundry?
You can buy socks with the soles of different colors.
Is there a way to erase pencil without a standard eraser?
You can use a piece of paper if you are coloring in marker and you mess up. You can cover it by using tape or glue to attach it. You have to put layers of  paper if you put glue because, the first layer of paper may tare or ripe. You can use this as an eraser for marker, crayon, or colored pencils.
What are some substitutes for gloves?
Archers use various leather finger guards, some with simple designs.  If you really want to avoid gloves but still be able to handle thorns, you may be able to fashion for yourself (from scraps?) a piece of leather or other protective material with one or more finger loops (which could be string) that can protect the "inside" of your hand while still letting the fingers "breathe" (and exposing the back of the hand/fingers to thorns etc.).   
How can I keep cats out of guest room, permanently?
Guaranteeing 100% absense means either physically blocking the room or removing the cats… so let's call this a 99% assurance.Ssscat Pet DeterrentI've had many many cats, and each of them insisted on being somewhere they did not belong. On the counter, in the garbage, digging in the pantry… this thing has stopped them all. It is not only an active repellent, but a training aid to teach them… never. to. return.It is essentially a compressed air sprayer with a motion detector to activate it when someone gets too close. If a cat approaches, it makes a loud hiss and sprays a stream of air at the intruder.  It's quite the deterrent —  it almost kept me from using the counter when I got "caught" unexpectedly — but it is completely harmless to the cats and they'll quickly learn to stay away, even if you remove or turn the device off.At $21.95, it sounds a bit expensive…  but the "solution" is actually rarely used, and — bonus — you can re-deploy it at multiple locations throughout the house. One or two encounters with this thing is enough to keep even the most determined cats away from those compulsive areas they just have to explore. I tried for almost a year to keep my cats off the counter before I found this solution. They don't go on the counter anymore. And if I think they might try — think Thanksgiving turkey — leaving this on the counter (turned off, so I can approach without getting sprayed) is enough to assure the cats will not give in to that urge to explore. For your situation, I would suggest placing this in front of the closed door facing outward into the hallway. They will learn quickly. Once they learn not to approach, I would try again with the door open. They will learn not to approach that room. I don't think it will take more than a few tries, but if you think they may forget their early lessons, you can leave the can on the floor (turned off, so you don't get psssssst'd every time you go into the room) as a reminder of what will happen if they approach. You don't even have to leave the can "on". The memory is enough to keep them away and, if they forget, the can is just a reminder. 
What are inexpensive ways to send wedding invitations?
My wife designed our wedding invitation to fit in the size of a 5.5" x 4.25" card (a postcard size).We printed them 4 to a page (the size fit perfectly on 9x11 sheet for 4). Our total print cost was about $55 or so. They looked really nice, too.Postage is also cheaper because postcard stamps are currently only $0.35/stamp vs $0.49/stamp. This saved us about $20 too compared to regular postage.One thing to keep in mind if you go this route is to ensure people see them as an invitation instead of save-the-date. Ours was not clear enough and some people thought our invitation was a save-the-date.
How to train myself to fall asleep faster?
My sleep hygiene used to be really bad (staying up really late, needing naps to get through the day, and taking forever to fall asleep sometimes), but in my current situation, I don't ever see needing any artificial inducers for sleep.I now fall asleep quickly and awaken just as quickly. I've chalked it up to getting older, but perhaps it's also lifestyle inadvertently shaping my sleeping patterns.The lifestyle factors involved, for my case:I don't exercise intentionally much, but I do walk around the city (most stops are very close to the subway.) I just got some new running shoes, I hope to start exercising more.I also don't take naps, unless I'm sick or have a headache.I dim my laptop screen dramatically sometime after sundown. Very dim. We have low-levels of lighting in my living room, where we spend our evenings, with a single lamp, I think it's a yellow fluorescent approximating the same output as a 60 watt incandescent bulb. My wife yells at me when I turn on the bright overhead fluorescent lights in the kitchen - they hurt her eyes.I don't eat anything after 10:00 or so. Not sure if that makes a difference, but I don't like jumping into bed immediately after eating.When my wife is ready to drag me to bed, she turns the lamp off (11:30 to midnight) and starts pulling on me (and I'll cooperate unless I'm in the middle of answering a very urgent question on the site). I naturally awaken every day around 7 or 8, perhaps motivated to check my StackOverflow rep changes. :)Almost as soon as my head hits the pillow, I'm out.Based on my experience, and relevant reading of pop-literature regarding common knowledge on this, my recommendations are, in order of my own perception of importance (first being most important):Dim your lights severely in the late evening. So dim you almost don't like it.Be ready for sleep. Not sleep-deprived, but having exhausted your waking hours for the day.Have at least some moderate exercise during the day.Don't eat right before bed.Have someone who needs sleep more than you regularly drag you to bed so your body stays used to the schedule.
How could you get a chair with very high arm rests with large surface area parallel to ground?
The arm rests will be lower with a sofa or armchair, because the seat of the chair is much nearer the floor. What you're describing is either an older person's armchair (much higher off the ground, usually with a seat parallel to the ground, and arms) or an executive office chair, which is exactly what I sit on when relaxing, no longer being able to sit on lower seats. The trouble is, you haven't said you want it to be higher than, say, a sofa or an ordinary armchair, so it may not suit you, but when I sit in mine, my arms are resting on the arm rests at the angle you describe, and the seat is parallel with the floor. The arm rests are not padded, but that could be remedied by doing a bit of home upholstery, or seeking out one which actually has padded arms. The other drawback, of course, is that they are swivel chairs, meaning a wheeled base, and you may not want that in your lounge or sitting room. Personally, I find the wheeled base and swivel action a godsend - I use it both at the dining table and in front of the tv, so moving it from one end of the room to the other is really easy. It's black leather, doesn't go with anything else, but they come in a range of colours and materials. But then I've got a very bad back, and maybe you haven't....
How to get rid of sorting and losing socks after laundry?
I found another solution which is quite smart. In germany it is called "sockstar". With this little plastic item you can clip your socks together. It even comes with a hook to hang them  directly on your clothesline. I don't post a link to this product, because I don't know if it is allowed. You can search it on your own. Maybe it is called different in other countries. A keyword is also "sock collector". 
How to remove armpit stains?
I have a few T-shirts that have been dyed dark colors in the washing machine. This might hide light staining or an over-all yellowing affect from bleaching.Relevant results when dying T-shirts:Some (nylon?) seam stitches didn't absorb dye and remain perfectly white.Silk-screen ink was generally unaffected and looks like it was applied to the color shirt.The amount of clothes being dyed affect how dark the resulting colors will be.
How can I prevent pee from flying off-target?
Just sit down when you have to go!
How to remove wax from woolen clothes?
After having to test exactly this over Christmas, I'd actually recommend using a towel rather than brown paper. Either a tea-towel or fine towel rather than a thick pile towel.Yes, the towel then needs a boil wash, but it draws all the wax out of the jumper much faster, so you don't need to keep the jumper at a high temperature for so long. This could be critical for a delicate wool jumper!
How to quickly warm up a toilet seat
Soak toilet paper with hot water.Rub the toilet paper on the ring of the seat and squeeze out the water.Then dry the toilet seat. The toilet seat is now warm.
How can I prevent pee from flying off-target?
Basically sitting down is the only safe option, but if some weird circumstance dictates that you can't do that you could utilize a cup or a bottle to pee into and/or redirect your stream.  The target area would then be closer, and you reduce the risk of spillage.This will however fail if you have "high pressure" pee stream... Then your other option is simply to get closer to the target somehow. Using a stall you could bend down towards the toilet bowl, and for a urinal get as close as possible. Do be advised that you might get splashing if the angles are incorrect.So in short, do sit down if uncertain and it's possible. If not, you're at risk of spillage, but can reduce the risk a little by getting closer to your target or utilize a catcher of some sort.
How can I prevent pee from flying off-target?
okay, first off here...  there is no way to prevent "splatter" other than sitting, however, by using a little muscle control and some simple hand manipulation the "splatter" may be severely reduced and overall aim improved. While not the best advice for "High Pressure Streams" this seems to work best for "low or intermitted" streams. First pinch shaft/urethra off and relax or lightly push using bladder muscles. Second once PRIMED system is achieved, simply release pinch point while simultaneously pushing like normal.Third once stream pressure has decreased to unsatisfactory level, pinch and repeat the process repeatedly.NOTE: I find it best to use sphincter muscle flex to stop stream before "bare minimum" pressure is achieved, as this helps prime the pump so to speak for the next pulse. Otherwise you may be at the can for quite a while.
How can I reduce echo and produce good quality sound in my room?
If the problem is in acoustics, you need to reduce the sound reflection from the walls. So you need to put sound absorbing material on the walls, or acoustic diffusing material. You can buy specially made for this purpose products. As you are asking here maybe you want to know what you can make yourself.Acoustic curtainsThe acoustic curtain material must be thick and highly porous.  You must select the thickest, heaviest fabric your budget will allow. The pores act as thousands of tiny sound traps, capturing the energy. Find a fabric that could soak up and absorb water, or has a plush, velour surface. Another option would be to use multiple layers of a thinner material. Acoustic Diffusers"They are an excellent alternative or complement to sound absorption because they do not remove sound energy, but can be used to effectively reduce distinct echoes and reflections while still leaving a live sounding space. Compared to a reflective surface, which will cause most of the energy to be reflected off at an angle equal to the angle of incidence, a diffusor will cause the sound energy to be radiated in many directions, hence leading to a more diffusive acoustic space." - from Wikipedia. You can make them with wooden panels. Search for a template for acoustic diffusers with the correct sizes. A variation of diffuser can be if you have shelves with books on the walls, just pull some of them a bit at different level, not to be aligned.Bass TrapsBass Traps are acoustic energy absorbers which are designed to damp low frequency sound energy, which are reducing LF resonances in rooms. They are usually placed in the corners of the room.Acoustic treatment of rooms is a whole science which is difficult to be explained in a single answer here. You need to do deeper research about how to make diffusers, absorbers, traps ... 
How can I prevent pee from flying off-target?
An alternative to sitting is to kneel in front of the toilet, if you are the tall enough. If your thigh bones are too short, the lip of the toilet bowl will be higher than you need it to be. (I'm 5' 10" and it works for me.)
How to train myself to fall asleep faster?
Stop thinking about anything. Often I catch myself thinking about stuff from the previous day or what I want to do (and how), that is, planning for the next. Of course thinking to stop thinking is still thinking. In case all other requirements are ok (haven't drunk coffee too late, have had at least a 16h day, etc.etc.) it helps me to try to think "black". Yeah just black-hole style nothing. Think about staring at a black wall with your eyes closed. I don't know why and it's completely crazy but I remember many days when that was the last thing I remember before sleeping.

How to get combat boots shined to mirror finish?
Kiwi polish Three polishing brushes A spoon A candle or hexamine block Three soft cotton duster cloths Brush boot first to get any detritus off it Wipe with cloth Get second brush dip in lieu and brush a layer of polisher over the boots, continue until a good layer of polish all over the boots make sure to get into all the books and cranny a of the boots. Get second cloth and buff hard,, repeat a couple of times. Light candle or hexy and heat up spoon, soot doesn't matter if they are black boots its actually a better thing. Making sure not to burn yourself run in circular motion with the back of the spoon heating the polish and leather and really work the polish in. Once you've completed that use a soft badger bristle brush to start bringing up the shine finally buff with clean duster cloth or use a chamois. Inspect and repeat if not satisfied. It's the working in of the Polish with a hot spoon that does it. In my troop only lazy f#ers heated the polish first before Dress Parade
How can I prevent pee from flying off-target?
I ALWAYS sit down on normal toilets, it's best to give the toilet seat a clean with toilet paper (nothing beats sitting down in someone else's pee ..). The odd chance I need to pee in a urinal, I pull back the skin on my you know what to make sure that doesn't get in the way. I also make a banana shape bend, so I'm really close to the urinal.
How to wake up early during a holiday?
I use an alarm clock, but set to a different time than on workdays, to let me sleep a little later, but keep it from being too hard to get to sleep at the right time before the next working day.  Often, I wake before the alarm, because I'm used to getting up earlier than that; in that case, I can turn it off until next night.
Is there method to protect coffee from moisture
Zipper closure plastic bags.  Squeeze out the air when closing, and store them in an opaque canister or similar to keep light out.  This will preserve coffee as well as any other method I've heard of.Also, buy whole bean coffee and grind it when you're setting up the machine to brew -- whole bean keeps several times longer than ground coffee, and costs no more (you will need to buy a grinder, but they aren't expensive).
Is there method to protect coffee from moisture
If its ground coffee, I always keep that in the freezer and use it straight out of the freezer too. I put the original bag inside a ziplok freezer bag and pop it in the bottom drawer of the freezer. Keeps fresher for a lot longer too...
How to clean Blu Tack?
There is a way! Put it in a vinegar like substance (like Non-brewed condiment) this works very well and can be done over and over again 
Is there method to protect coffee from moisture
Just store your coffee in an airtight container or plastic bag, along with a small pouch of silica gel on top of the contents.Silica gel is non-toxic, non-flammable, non-reactive and stable with ordinary usage. It absorbs moisture from the surroundings effectively. It is commonly used to dry out empty water bottles and to remove moisture from shoes, which in return prevents the stench.
How do I prevent plates coming out of the dishwasher squeaky?
it may be that your plates and bowls are unfortunately permanently damaged. It really depends on what kind of material they were made out of.I personally like using all-in-one gels with no rinse aide. The rinse aide simply prevents spotting on finished dishware, so isn't necessary to have clean dishes. If it isn't a big deal, skip the rinse aide and just try a gel or single-use pack. If they still have water spots, as soon as the dishwasher cools down a little, dry your dishes by hand and you won't have to use a rinse-aide.The less chemicals touching your dishware (especially the delicate stuff) the better.
Is there method to protect coffee from moisture
We keep our ground coffee in a stainless steel container with a tight lid in the fridge.The low temperature and dry air in a fridge will not only prevent moisture from entering the ground coffee but it will also help to keep the aroma fresh for a much longer time.
How to use the end of a squeezy tube?
A simple tube squeezer should do the trick, making your solution cheap and almost permanent since they're generally made out of durable and sturdy plastic. You can find them almost everywhere. 
How to use the end of a squeezy tube?
For the last bit of toothpaste in a tube, I have often resorted to pliers. I bend the flattened tube to one side, put one face of the pliers on the "face" of the cap, and the other face of the pliers on the bent-over flattened tube. Then I just squeeze, and more toothpaste comes out. (Obviously the plier face doesn't cover the hole in the cap. It's positioned next to the hole.)
How to use the end of a squeezy tube?
If you don't want to have a dedicated tool lying around for the job you can do what I've always done:Hold the end of the tube with your right hand.Hold the open side of the tube with your left hand.Place your right hand with the end of the tube right below the edge of your toilet sink.Strongly press down on the tube and slide it down until your toothpaste (or whatever it is) is conveniently concentrated near the open side of the tube.Profit.
Making the most of a mug that can't be put in the microwave or diswasher
Something about the mug interacts with the microwaves; almost certainly because it's conductive, so that it heats up in ways you wouldn't want it to. This means that you can't change the mug's non-microwave-friendliness without substantially changing the mug. For instance, if it's the coating/glaze/paint, then you'd have to remove it in order to make it non-conductive. If it's the mug material itself then you'd have to remove the mug itself to make it non-conductive (you'd have The Emperor's New Mug).One test I've seen is to fill the possibly non-microwaveable container with water and then microwave it for twenty seconds at a time, seeing whether the water or the container heats up faster. If the container doesn't heat up you're fine. If it does, then you're stuck.
How to use the end of a squeezy tube?
One alternate solution not related to using different squeeze alternatives, is to cut open the end of the tube, and insert something else to use as a piston.That is, you could use some cotton or possible some plastic inserted into the end, and when this is made into a ball (or sort of piston), this can be used to drive everything else forward in the tube and out of the opening.
Making the most of a mug that can't be put in the microwave or diswasher
Use it as a pen/pencil holder on your desk.  That way you get to show it off without damaging it.
Earbud wiring setup to avoid yanking laptop / tablet when fall asleep
Try using an extender and wiring it so that it comes to you from above and behind your head while you are in bed. This would have the least chance of tangling. Suspending it on top of the headboard would help. 
Creating a stylus holder that attaches to tablet via full sized USB
I like your idea of using the USB adapter as a platform for loop or claw to hold the stylus.I have used hand mold-able thermoplastic for similar purposes. They come in several brand names like InstaMorph, Polymorph etc. Basically it is a plastic with low melting point that you can soften with hot water and use your hand to mold it into the desired shape. This plastic is re-usable and can thus be re-done if the design doesn't work. I would suggest using the USB connector you linked to and then use the plastic to make a loop or any shape that would hold the stylus. The plastic sets hard and is a bit flexible, so you could make a claw with a small opening to hold the stylus.There is another material called 'Sugru' that is essentially a silicone putty that sets into a hard flexible material, but is not re-usable. Search for it and you will see a lot of interesting uses for it.For those of us who don't have access to a 3D printer, these materials are perfect for quick hacks.
Preventing glasses from fogging up when wearing scarf
I don't know if it will work while wearing a scarf, but I use Rain-X on my glasses to help when moving between temperatures to help with fogging.
How to use the end of a squeezy tube?
Wait till you have several almost empty tubes.  Then cut the tail-end off of one of  them.  Cut the others nearer to the nozzle.  Scoop the remaining product out of these tubes and put it into the one with the cut tail-end.  Crimp the end of the nearly full tube, folding it over several times & using pliers to set the crimp.  Use the product & when it's almost empty, repeat the process.  With some plastic tubes which are hard to crimp, I attach a tube key (search "tube key" on google) which securely holds it closed. 
How can I keep bears out of the trash?
Bears are intelligent, have long claws and are immensely strong. Odor will not deter them. There are a number of bear-resistant trash containers on the market, e.g. Bearsaver, though I expect they're a bit pricey.For small amounts of trash, suspending a receptacle with rope and pulley from a tall tree might work, though small bears do climb.If you decide to create your own container, see the hints at BearSmart.com, such as reducing odor from food waste, fitting lids with recessed latches, and making the container strong and tip-resistant.See what a bear can do to a "container" such as a car.
Getting a human on an automated helpdesk
The Chatbot caseAs per OP's clarification we are dealing with a text only chatbot. It is a very basic AI if any, and it does not use Speech recognition.A way to understand how these run-of-the-mill chatbots as follows: they have a list of categories. They internally have a set of keywords for each category (some keywords may appear in two or more categories). They scan the text you write for keywords... each keyword they find contributes points to particular categories. Afterwards they take the category with more points, and so they assume you are talking about something in that category.Once they have stablished on what category your text falls, they will have to choose a response from that category. The worst chatbots I have seen have around ten categories and only one response per category.Slightly more advanced chatbots may have memory of what has been told, they may try to use spell checking or sounds-alike searches to try to force the text into a category. The next level of chatbot technology is able to do rudimentary phrase analysis such as ´{pronoum} {verb} {object}´ - this is not the case here, tho.It may be worth noting that - while no chatbot in the world has passed the Turinh Test (for real) against a complete set of experts examiners - some chatbots can actually fool unsuspected people. Aside from being used in customer support, they have uses in video games, they have uses as part of scam schemes, etc...Note: top-of-the-line chatbots are way better than the one involved here. Although even the best won't convince everybody to be human, and hardly will convince anyone to be a particularly smart human.Consider this case:Me: You are worse than your namesake  PC: You can change your display name on www.foobar.com with the Profile button  The chatbot has - probably - only recognized the word "name", has put the text into the category of "thing related to the name of the user" or something like that. Ans has come up with a pre-cooked answer for those type of questions.Another example is this one:Me: I've visited every damn page on foobar.com, all I want to do is to go from pop3 to imap  PC: There's no need to become emotional. I am Lisa, the automated assistant. How can I help you?I'm guessing the recognized word here is "damn", and this is probably a standard fallback for all insults in his database. Being it a fallback, it ignores all else.Knowing this you may try thinks like: Contact human, Contact email or something like that, that may trigger a response in the right category. Avoid unecesary words, brevity is your friend.See this case:Me: You are useless, how do I contact a human?  PC: On www.foobar.com/usability you can read how our site works It could be the case that they expect - maybe they noticed, they could have word statistics - that people may complain that the service of www.foobar.com is useless. Or simply it matched it to "how to use" category. Whatever the case they have a predefined answer to direct people to www.foobar.com/usability. The same query without "You are useless" may have worked - may be not. But this a particulary dumb chatbot, it doens't understand that a sentence may have more than one phrase - in fact, it probably ignores all punctuation (and short words).Addendum: It has ocurred to me that perhaps the reason why why don't you dissolve yourself in fuming nitric acid may work is because the words didn't fall in any category, not even the insults fallback. So you may try very specific words that has nothing to do with the web site, along the lines of phosphate, eletromagnetism, manifold, tetragrammaton, malapropism, valetudinarian, ragamuffin, etc... you get the idea.Here is the deeper problem: there may not be a human to answer the chat. It is possible that the developers of the webpage has included this catbot mechanism as a "user friendly search", they may have worried about usability of the page and used it as a bandaid. Or it could be a gimmick to appeal to sales. Or somebody has used steak and sex to sell the chatbot to their boss and now they have to add it because reasons, etc... Whatever leaded to this chatbot, it doens't imply that there may be humans. And even if sometimes there are humans, they may only be part time - hiring lots of people for covering different shifts and hight demand hours is expensive.Of course, checking every damn page on foobar.com^1 is the way to go. I usually don't bother with chatbots. Yet, since you say you did and didn't find what you were looking for...Take the high route on the chatbot, there is no need bother with it.Try using a search engine. You can use site:foobar.com on most search engines^2 to restrict a search to a particular internet domain. Using keywords such as contact and email, you may also try common email providers such as gmail.com (or with at @gmail.com it may or may not match depending on the search engine), etc...Find them on social media. You can try using Facebook search, Twitter search, Google+ search, etc... it is common for there to be somebody hired to check those places on a regular basis. If there is no email, this could be the next best thing. Although, due to the bulk of input they may be getting this way, they could just ignore it.Phonebook. Some telephone companies - and similars - have online search for their phonebooks. Try finding one from city of the company. If you find une, you could use it to get a phone number or email address of the company you want.^1: Didn't you miss any? There are solutions to crawl and download a web site. HTTrack comes to mind (it may go against Terms of Use). Once downloaded you can search there using - for example Agent Ransack or similar. Although I would consider that a last reasort option.^2: Tested on Duckduckgo, Google, Bing, and Yahoo! Search.If none of the above works, it means that this company is particularly not approachable. You may try to send a letter, yet if you are still insisting you probably want to try some not offical ways to contact them.The options below can be considered competitive intelligence - barelyUse whois service. Some webpages such as internic.net among others allow you to get registration information about internet domains. This information may include an email. If there is no email, look for the entry "Whois Server" visit their page and try searching for the domain there - they usually have more information. It could be the case that the email you find is fake, that is the case if it was obscured by "privacy reasons", which is becoming more common, but it is still worth a shot.Specialized services. I have come across the EmailHunter which will search for email addresses for a particular web domain. Think of it as a web search but it can only find email accounts for the domain you enter - it may have fake results, as it goes by what is on the web, you will need to try to use the email to know if it is real. There is a paid plan, yet it can be used for free with some restrictions. Another alternative comes from CEOEmail which is a database of well known contact information of high staff members of big companies - query by the name of the company.Find employees. Again, in social media. If you can find some approachable employee [I opt not to explain means to try to do this other than regular search], get a way to ask them. Who you find is hardly who may help you, but may know who can. Since you don't want to pass as a stalker, you will restrict yourself to publicly available information and will not try to contact a person insistently (nor from various means at the same time).Finally, according to CleverBot:ME: How do I contact a Human?CleverBot: Try signalling out of the window on the first Friday of the month when the moon is full.Sorry, I have no more to offer.Orignal AnswerI'm keeping this answer because it may be useful for thirs parties that may find this question - yet, sice the AI is a text only chatbot, this doesn't address the OP's question.We've all encountered it; an automated helpdesk, usually pretending to be a human, which persistently misinterprets your requests.If we are talking about a machine, it is common that 0 will take you to a human. Otherwise listen if it give you a menu, and see what is the right option to talk to a human. If this is an AI, ask for a human operator - insist! (speech recognition is not perfect).On the other hand, If you started by offending the person who attends you... First understand that helpdesk job is low entry and with high personal rotaton. People may end there because it has been particulary hard to get a job doing whatever they studied for - and probably don't want to stay there longer than needed. Also, a good portion of the requests they get are dumb people who doesn't know how to operate a machine, a another good chunk are simple operations. By policy they make you follow some simple instructions that usually are expected to cover around 80% of the cases. The call is recorded - and sometimes a supervisor may be listening in real time - and if they don't do as the policy says, they may get in trouble.I have friends who did work in call centers, I have formed my opinion from there.While I would agree they are not particulary tech savvy, they are humans.Work with themThe first option is always to try to work with them. To make them skip the normal steps provide as much information as possible, also explicitly say what checks you did. For instance - in the example of failing Internet connection - say that you have a modem XYZ (where XYZ is the manufaturer and model if you know it), that it has XYZ leds on, that it is properly connected, that you have already disconnected it from the power and conneced it back again, and that you have checked with another network cable and another computer... and none did work.If you are tech savvy as I presume, you should be able to do - and proably already do that kind of stuff to rule out all else before calling. If you are a bit like me, you want to avoid calling if reasonable.Tell them all you did, and they will usually move on to check the connection remotely and try to fix it on their end, they may schedule a tech visit, or give you another mean for contact. All depending what is the case, and what are you calling for.Note: politeness doesn't buy you anything, but insult usually won't work either. The reason it did seem to work is because they may ask you if you want to use other means of communication to get rid of you. But that is not a solution, just a diversion. If you want a solution, just go to the point, and be explicit.It did not work. Ok...Ask for a supervisor. If you insist in talking to a supervisor and they don't allow you to do it, they are sure to get in trouble. Also, it is a call attended for them - and they may be happy to get rid of you. It is win-win.Once you get a supervisor in the line - sadly you may have to tell again what is the case. The supervisors are usually more experienced, and they they may have the power to put on the line somebody who can assist you better. Note: this changes from company to company, some do outsource the call center service and so there is no way to put on the line the people who actually can fix the problem.It did not work. Ok...It usually means they don't have a solution for you. You cannot force the company to do whatever you want. So back off! This is probably a company you don't want to be stuck with, they have bad customer service, look for alternatives.But there may be a way to get information from them. If you wanna put more resources in the matter.Depending on your country and region/state there may be some law that you can invoke to make a formal petition for infomation. Learn about laws related to right to access information, it may be under freedom of the press, customer support, or something like that.I don't know if that is the case in USA, but it is the case in my country.You may be able to get free judicial consulting from law schools, where students near graduation do this kind of service. Find those near your area, and ask if do. You will have to pay a visit for that, tho.If there is a law that can apply. Invoke the law! they will now have the obligation to respond your inquiry. Which maybe something like "how to get tech visit" or "where do I take a defective product for revision or replacement", etc... just ask for information on how to get your problem fixed.It is worth noting that it usually better to invoke the law in a letter, that you deliver personally, and for which you have a receipt copy signed by whoever receives it. That you have evidence that you did - in fact - invoke the law.Note: At the start of a call the person attending you will usually introduce themselves. Write down the name of the person who attends you, and the time and date of the call. If they give you a number for the report write that too. If in you need to call again, you can say who attended you the last time, and if in the future you need to write a letter about the problem you can include that information.In the extreme, If legal action is taken - because they are denying a right, or failing to comply, or similar - a judge may give the order to get a copy of the recording of the calls. Which should be futher evidence in your favor.For example, if you have been trying to cancel (as in, stop) a service that is renewed automatically each year, and it is required to be requested to cancel it with anticipation of the renewal... and you did call in time, and they didn't help you... you may take legal actions, and demostrating that you did request the cancellation in time will win you the case. And you probably want to take legal actions in that case, as not doing so may mean to be stuck paying for another year.
How to revive dried up pens
The idea is that the tip is clogged. And you want to allow it to flow again.--You may try to dilate the tip (and slim the ink) with heat to allow the ink to flow. Other answers have already pointed to heat based solutions, such as using a candle.Another option for the heat idea is to use pen against glass very fast. Glass won't get a permanent mark, and it will be hard for the ballpoint pen to scratch it. The fast motion is meant to heat the point of the pen by friction.You may also try to use gravity (leaving the pen in a verticall position) to try to force the ink to flow. Other options are to use centrifugal force (that is a virtual force, it exists), or - in the case of cheap rollerball pens - dismantle the pen and blow the ink to the tip from the opposite side - beware of excess flow, do it against something that can absorb the ink.On the other hand the ink may be dry. If it is not totally dry, you may try to mix it.What kind of ink is it? Ink is usally a suspension in water, oil or alcohol. Rollerball pen usually are water based, others may use oil. Alcohol is only common in markers.Whatever it is... add that to the ink - or the tip, if you don't have access to the ink. Water (Saliva from licking has been also suggested), Mineral Oil (Johnson's Baby Oil will do) or Alcohol (Isopropyl or in its defect, Methanol), depending the case.

Dog hair in washing machine
Excess hair isn't washed out of machine with the clothes so easily. Much of the hair is simply re-deposited back in the machine reappearing in the next cycle. Your washing machine also has its own "lint trap" of sorts in the form of a drain pump filter which has to be cleaned out periodically or all that gunk/hair can work its way back into the wash cycle.To get excessive hair and out of the washing system, start with wiping out the tub. Make sure the washing machine is completely dry. I suggest leaving the lid open and letting it air dry at least overnight. Using a brush attachment, vacuum the washing machine drum and any other areas around the inside and outside of the machine where you might find fur. Remove and clean your drain pump filter and reinstall (see the manufacturer's instruction manual for its location).Add 2 cups of white vinegar to the washer's tub and run through an entire regular washing machine cycle (empty) using a hot water setting.With the washing machine empty again, use a sponge to wipe down the the drum of the machine with a quarter cup of vinegar added to a gallon of warm water. Make sure you get the areas around any dispensers or gaskets (typically on front-loading machines only) that may be hiding accumulated debris. Use a smaller scrub brush or toothbrush if there are lot of smaller areas that are difficult to get into. Run one last cleaning cycle through with just plain hot water (no detergent or vinegar) to get the machine ready for the next load.

Earbud wiring setup to avoid yanking laptop / tablet when fall asleep
Two solutions springs to mind:Use a playback device which pauses when disconnected – Some devices, like the iPod devices, automatically goes to pause if the earphones are disconnected. This would allow for them to be unplugged during the night without disturbing others.Use an extension cord which is fastened – If you fasten the extension cord so that if you pull the ear plugs/buds cord, it will disconnect from the extension cord. This will still leave the extension cord plugged in to you playback device, but no sound will be heard as a wire is still connected and additionally the playback device will not be touched as all the force when they disconnect is at the joint between the extension cord and the ear plugs/buds.

How can I keep the interior of my car dry while driving in the rain?
Get some of the sunscreen material from an auto parts shop that has lots of small holes punched in it. Cut it into strips that will fit over the gap from the inside roof to the top of the window. You will have to attach it to the roof (inside) and the window (also inside), forming a channel where most of the rain will fall. Run the lower end of the channel into a container to collect the rain. Dump it as needed.This method will not absolutely prevent rain from entering the vehicle, but will reduce it enough to prevent most of the issues you are having.

What is the best and easiest way to pick up mercury drops from the floor?
Mercury cleanup is not simple or easy. Though you can pick up the biggest droplets with a pipette (medicine dropper), do not use a vacuum cleaner, because it spreads the highly toxic mercury vapor throughout a room, or even a building.The New York Department of Health has an online guide. In particular, after removing all droplets you can find, then rub powdered sulfur in the area of the spill, which will, over time, combine with mercury to form the less toxic mercury sulfide. The guide also lists sources for cleanup kits; Amazon carries a few for US$30 and more. A guide may also be downloaded from the US CDC.The biggest danger is from long-term exposure to mercury vapor, or to organic mercury compounds that could be formed through bacterial action. Commercial hazardous waste specialists have meters to detect minuscule amounts of mercury vapor which can help track remaining particles in flooring. If the spill is large, definitely use professional cleanup service.

Making the most of a mug that can't be put in the microwave or diswasher
A mug like the one you received cannot be used in the microwave, and cannot be converted into one that can.I have several mugs that fall into the same category.My recommendation: Turn them into flower pots.Unique drinking mugs make great flower pots, and you get to see them every day.They even work great as "starter pots".  You can put a few seeds in them, or even a small potato or garlic clove, and with a little soil and water, you'll have a beautiful plant in no time!
How can I keep the interior of my car dry while driving in the rain?
I do believe that since we're talking about cars and traffic safety I would strongly recommend buying the professional rain guards, which should be available at reasonable prices. I would not suggest to make something intermediate which has even a low risk of falling of the car and hitting other traffic. This is especially dangerous/probable if you talk about fixing something to the top of the car window frame whilst driving!The alternate solution, that is attaching something on the inside, could be viable, but I'm not sure how pretty it would be. This could be fasten intermediately or more permanently depending on needs, and how nice you want it.One intermediate way could be to have a thin plexiglass where you glue a larger piece of clear plastic to it. The plexiglass you insert on the inside of the car window, and let the clear plastic drape over your leather on the inside. Now you should be able to roll down the window a few inches for ventilation, and any rain entering will hit the plastic and run over the plastic onto the floor of your car.

How to revive dried up pens
Actually I had these great pens which I seriously loved and used them but after around the first or second time I used them they stopped working. So I saw this post and tried various methods but what worked for me is that I removed the refill and separated the matal nib part from the plastic part and then put a very tiny amount of nail polish remover into both parts then I shook them for a minute an rubbed the big forcefully on to an eraser because the ball wasn't moving so I did this to the other pen too and it workedAlso keep some nail polish remover handy in case you got some ink on your hands.:)

How can I eat my bagel when I lack a knife to cut it?
Knives are useful tools for cutting bagels and applying delicious spreads such as peanut butter or cream cheese, but luckily if you are missing this implement, you can still enjoy your bagel with 3 easy steps.Rip your bagel into dunkable pieces.Swipe them through the peanut butter or cream cheese.Cram them into your gullet.
How can I eat my bagel when I lack a knife to cut it?
Look around and see if you can spot a letter opener (old usage was "paper knife").  It's likely to be sharp enough, with patience, to cut the bagel, and it will surely work to spread your peanut butter and cream cheese.Failing that, a plastic fork from the lunch room can probably be used to split the bagel (push the tines in repeatedly along a line where you'd normally cut; when you've worked your way all around, the bagel should split easily along the perforations), and will also spread the toppings, after a fashion.
How can I eat my bagel when I lack a knife to cut it?
Some toasters in the UK* have a warming rack that can be used to heat bagels, crumpets and the like. The warming rack is a pop-up that allows you to perch your larger items above the slots, to warm the item with the rising heat.Simple use the warming rack to warm your bagel, and then dip it using @Sterno's method.*Apparently this also applies to most of Western Europe, but not to the USA. Unfortunately the USA is where most bagels are consumed, which rather limits the usefulness of this answer!

Preventing glasses from fogging up when wearing scarf
Try a few swipes/dabs of white bar soap on each glass and and buff till clear. It will give some pretty good results. It's not possible to completely remove fogging in cold weather due to the law of physics, but this does a great job and is one of the better options as well as inexpensive.Don't use the heavily scented or colored soaps which will be counterproductive. Something like the white Johnson's baby soap should work well.

How to remove armpit stains?
There are a couple of methods that when applied individually or in combination (for deep-cleanse) directly onto the stains worked in our case.Make a thick paste of some Oxi-Clean powder and some water. Apply and leave for some time and then wash in hottest water possible.Spray for stain remover (Shout brand with Oxi-Clean enriched is one we used) worked.Use a paste of baking soda on the stains.These work perfectly with blend type fabrics and pretty well on pure cotton fabrics. Also frequent application is important, if the stains have been building up for a long time, it will take several applications to break it down completely.

I saw this on Shark Tank and it seems to be what you're looking for : Nerd Wax .It's made of beeswax (and maybe some other stuff), so if you have a readily available source of beeswax, you might try that instead. Put the wax on the nose pieces to give them more grip.
How to get rid of sorting and losing socks after laundry?
With five people in the house, we used to go crazy fishing for and finding the matching sock just before we needed it. I saw this trick used by a woman in a movie and have been using it since very successfully.Just put one of the the matching sock inside the other from its pair before storing them. Whenever you need a pair, you will always have them both right at your fingertips. No need for rummaging through a pile of socks and almost not finding it at times when you have to leave in a hurry.After laundry, first fold/remove all large clothes and just ignore all socks. When all that are left are socks, start pairing them off. Stuff one sock inside its matching pair and then just put it away for storage in its right place.When you need it, you will have pairs ready instead of the earlier scary ordeal where you have to search for the lone sock in a mess.
How to clean floor if there is cooking-oil spilled on it?
After wiping most of the oil that you can trap with paper towels, use some kitchen wipes until all oil is off. These have grease cutting agents that just don't push oil around but instead get them off. Something like the Chlorox wipes - the Kirkland (Costco) kitchen wipe is the best in my opinion mainly because of its size and durability for such oily tasks. I have used this method successfully for not so major oil spills. Good luck!
How to separate paper from college block?

How to quickly dry out a Camelbak?
My solution for storing multiple Camelbak bladders for long periods of time without any mold or mildew inside is to fill them with water and then make sure ALL of the air is bled out before storing.  Mold and mildew need air to grow so if the interior has no air or bubbles of any kind, presto! Nothing will grow!Just fill the bladder with water then flip it so the hose is at the upper end of the bladder and jiggle until all the air is at the base of the hose.  I then use the mouth piece to suck out all the air.  If you're going to store it for a really long time, do it again until there is absolutely no air inside.  This absolutely works perfectly.  I've been using this method for years.
Is there method to protect coffee from moisture
Use one of those airtight jars/containers for sugar,flour,rice,or cracker snacks would work for protecting your coffee from moisture. Searching for those online yields a lot of different brands and styles of containers for you to choose from. An example of what those look like:
What is the best and easiest way to pick up mercury drops from the floor?
To collect bulk amounts a thin sheet of paper can be used. Lay the paper on the surface, then use another piece of paper to coax the blob of mercury onto the paper. Once the blob is in the center of the paper, make a thick ring of glue around it and put a second sheet of paper on top and let it dry. The mercury will be trapped. Take the envelope to the container and puncture a hole through it, allowing the mercury to flow back into the container.Note that the mercury will now be "dirty" and useless for many purposes because it will have absorbed dust and dirt. For this reason, spilled mercury is not usually re-used.Whether you collect a blob or not, you still need to clean the surface where it dropped, because the mercury will be in the crevices.Use a copper or brass wire brush of the thinest gage you can find. Jewelry supply houses (and Amazon) have fine brass wire brushes. Also, you can find copper "scourers" that are useful if the surface has no crevices. You can even use steel wool in crevices. If you use steel wool, I would recommend etching it first in vinegar. Soak the steel wool in vinegar for about an hour. Rinse and dry. Then use it on the mercury gently.You can also make a brush. Get the finest copper wires you can find (by stripping braided electrical wire for example), then fold the wires over and over, then cut. Glue the wires to a little piece of wood or something so you have a brush. Now carefully brush all the places where the mercury was. The mercury will amalgamate into the copper. As long as the copper touches it, the mercury will flow into the copper perfectly and every last microgram will be absorbed.Discard the brush in a well-sealed container.Note: a good copper wire brush can also be used to collect blobs of spilled mercury as an alternative to the paper method; if your brush is good, the mercury will glom onto it in globules and can be shaken off into a container. In the old days, this was the standard method to recover significant quantities of spilled mercury.
How can I keep bears out of the trash?
The only way to protect trash from a bear without using specific bear-proof containers is to build an enclosure with a VERY rugged door, think steel, with multiple latches. Looks like you have some cinderblocks, so I guess that is one step in that direction. Maybe hire a mason to build an enclosure?Option 2 is to forget the plastic things and use actual bear-proof containers, which are generally 55-gallon steel drums (think oil barrels with locking lids). You can buy them. They are a complete pain in the ass to use.There is no way to "repel" a bear. (Leonardo DiCaprio can tell you about that.)

How to kill the stink in an unplugged refrigerator?
One more thing I want to add to the answer that was given by Bondoc.Refrigerators have trays usually hidden underneath them. These trays hold all the melting water that may also include some residuals from spoiled food inside freezer. In order to get rid off bad odors, first remove the tray and wash it thoroughly and then place the products mentioned above into the refrigerator. If you have an old refrigerator and never heard of the tray, you will be surprised when you see how dirty the hidden tray can get.Good Luck
How can I keep bears out of the trash?
Perhaps you could use a chain and padlock to secure the lid closed.

How do I chew bubble gum if I am wearing dental braces?
I had braces for a ridiculous amount of time. Some gum is easier to chew with braces than other gum. It needs to be very cohesive, not necessarily more sugary which breaks apart. Small pieces of gum are better than bigger ones, and don't go pushing your gum up into your cheeks and stuff. Just try to keep it off your dental work, but it may get stuck there eventually. Then you have to pick it out. Your orthodontist might not like it, but it could be worse. 
How can I eat my bagel when I lack a knife to cut it?
find a piece of plastic like a telephone card or a credit card, abrade the edge against a rough surface like a stone or even bite little dents in it, or use any metal object, and use that to cut. takes 2 minutes.find a magazine cover, glossy one, or a plastic film, put a book on the bread and use it as a knife, if it's abraded it will be faster. find a thin wire like a copper wire, abrade it, use it like a cheese cutter.

How can I keep the interior of my car dry while driving in the rain?
Frankly, the solution is simple: Don't smoke in the car.Obvious health and financial benefits aside, there's some more benefits:You don't need to buy anything to prevent rain from entering your car.The car's value will not decrease due to the lingering smell of smoke. (Saving even more money in the long run)Your drive will be significantly safer, since you don't need to pay attention to a cigar / cigarette any more. Especially in emergency situations, a dropped (lit) cigarette can be a massive distraction.As mentioned in the comments, technically, it's illegal to drive with only one hand on the wheel, in some countries.
How can I quickly and easily attach two (or more) piece of paper together with tape?
Use packing tape it's wide enough to provide you a good grip on the pages, put it on both sides of the sheets, if you want to be able to fold your printed music for easy traveling, then place the sheets half a cm apart before sticking them to the tape.
What's the best way to get a Stack Exchange question on the Hot Network Questions list?
Write a question that is interesting to a sizeable portion of the potential audience. Post it at a time of day where the site is busy (so there's a larger audience before it passes off the first couple of pages of questions).Some controversy in the question would typically result in some debate and make it more likely to get to the Hot list (the Hot Questions are defined by views within the last x minutes), but writing a question that fits the Stack Exchange model while courting controversy is going to be difficult.I wrote a question that (briefly) made the Hot Questions list on SciFi&Fantasy - it was topical (it was about the previous week's episode of Doctor Who), interesting, written in a way that was engaging (if I do say so myself), and was picked up by many of the Doctor Who fans.
How can I keep the interior of my car dry while driving in the rain?
While not smoking in the car is the best solution, we need to recognize that many/ most smokers are addicts and find it very difficult to pass a long drive without a smoke.The simplest way to keep rain out with a window open, regardless of the reason for opening the window, is to open the window just a small amount (a centimeter is about right), and run the ventilation fan on flow-through at a high setting.  The airflow outward will modify flow outside the window to keep all but the most direct splashes out of the window, and any foul odors generated inside the car will be exhausted as efficiently as possible.Worth noting that you should still use the interior ash tray; it is illegal in every state in the USA to throw burning material from a car (which might include the coal from your cigarette, when flicking ashes out the window, and certainly would include a butt that hasn't been extinguished).  In forested areas, the fine has long been as high as it can be without trespassing into felony levels, and if the act starts a wildfire it might well be charged as a felony.  And if you're going to use the ash tray anyway, I don't see much to gain by keeping the window open, other than to blow ashes around the interior of the car, defeating any purpose of keeping the car from smelling like tobacco smoke.
How to rid steelware of metallic taste
Instead of changing the properties of a metal, the easiest thing would be to permanently have your own set of steelware at the office. Use it a lunch, wash/clean it, store it in your cubicle/office. I usually have my mug and some utensils at my workplace, I rather spend a couple of minutes washing them than using things I don't feel comfortable with(I've seen how my coworkers "clean" the utensils)

How to determine how much heating oil is left in the tank?
Use a long stick or pole - tent poles are awesome. Insert straight down the fill hole, pull out and measure the length of wet on the stick. Measure your tank to find out your capacity and then, using your measurements Refer to this chart to determine your oil level:http://www.adamspetro.com/residential-heating-tank-chartSo, using the chart, if I had a 275H tank and I measured 10 inches on my stick then I would have about 96 gallons of fuel remaining. 
How can I eat my bagel when I lack a knife to cut it?
If you pinch the bagel with both hands, thumbs inside the hole and fingers around the circumference, then use enought force to break through the crust with your thumbs (those with long nails may find this easier), then pull gently apart, but not completely, you'll have separated a portion of the bagel close to the middle.  Rotate your fingers and thumb slightly and perform the process again.  Do this repeatedly and soon you'll have two halves of the bagel, as though you'd cut them with a knife, though much more ragged.They will now fit into the toaster.For spreading, you can simply use your fingers, but if keeping your fingers clean is important or you can't wash them afterwards, use a napkin or paper towel wrapped around a finger or two to gather the spread and apply it to the bagel halves.
How to clean inside of straw
Get yourself some bottle cleaners for the natural flow bottles, they are perfect for cleaning straws for plastic cups! Our 4 year old has a few of the toddler size cups with these plastic straws and we use the natural flow cleaner brushes to clean her straws (and out three month old daughters bottles too!). They are inexpensive, and last a long time compared to having to use a new long q-tip every time you wash the straw.You can pick these up everywhere that has a baby section, WalMart, Walgreens, CVS, Toys R Us, etc.
How to rid steelware of metallic taste
"Just Do It" suggested leaving clean utensils at your desk every day. Another option, if you have a lunch bag that you always use to bring your food, is to have a set of utensils that you always leave in your lunch bag. When you get home, you could either wash them and put them back in your lunch bag, or put them in the sink/dishwasher and put a clean set in your lunch bag. Just so long as there's always a set in your lunch bag!(I know this is a workaround, not an actual solution for removing the metallic taste from the utensils at work. But the answer from "Just Do It" was well received, so I thought I'd add this workaround too.)

What's the best way to deal with a low sun when driving?
I use 3 methods (in decreasing order of preferability and safety):  Sunglasses. Preferably polarized ones, these reduce the sun's glare without making everything else too dark. A baseball cap: I can usually angle it to block out the sun without blocking too much else. Works reasonably well for highway driving, not so much in city traffic (you have to adjust every time you change direction).if all else fails, I hold up my hand to block the sun. Not as safe and you can't do this long, but better some vision than none at all.  
What's the best way to deal with a low sun when driving?
The most important factor with very low sun angles is to make sure the windshield is very clean, both outside (easy) and inside.  Cleaning the inside with glass cleaner and paper towels will remove a surprising amount of film that, if left on the glass, will scatter light, obscuring background objects (like the ones you're trying not to collide with) when strongly backlit.The same applies to glasses or sunglasses you might wear; the dirtier the lenses are, the more the sunlight will glare in your eyes and obscure objects.In the extreme case, park for ten minutes -- at least in temperate or tropical latitudes, if the sun is so low you can't block it at all without blocking everything, it'll be gone in that amount of time.
How can I quickly and easily attach two (or more) piece of paper together with tape?
If you want the joint to be durable, stick tape on both sides especially if you want to fold along the joints. Makes sure you leave a small gap between the pages if you want to fold and make a crease along the joint. Also make sure to use a zig-zag fold(fan fold).To make the whole sheet durable, use packing tape to tape over the the whole page. This would be similar to laminating the pages.
How can I quickly and easily attach two (or more) piece of paper together with tape?
"Just Do It" and "Vinod" have already covered attaching the pages together. You also asked how to align the pages accurately. I suggest blu-tacking a ruler to the surface of the desk or table you are working on. Position it parallel to the edge nearest to you. When you are lining up two pages ready to stick them together, gently push the bottom edge of each page so that they both abut the ruler. That way they will be level with each other.
What is the most efficient way to fold a map?
I like to fold a map in half and then maybe in half again (in the same direction) until the general area I am interested in is available on the front and back side of that strip. Then I'll fold that strip in the other direction accordion-style so I can flip through the folded sections like a book. Photo by Bill Hanscom, licensed by Creative CommonsAs I travel east or west, I simply turn the pages. If I travel north, I can simply flip the book over and continue on the other side of the book. If I travel to another section of the map entirely, it's simple enough to refold the original strip to the correct area and continue in the same manner. I can even stuff that pamphlet in my back pocket leaving it open to the right page for quick reference. This works great for those theme park maps they give you at most area attractions.
How to make sure nobody can hear anything when I'm listening music through my headphones
Download a sound test music file that plays a wide enough range of frequencies from bass to top, therefore you've tested them to suit almost every song on your playlist. Take out your earphones and listen. Once you wear the earphones the volume to the surroundings is reduced as the sound waves are contained within your ear, bounced around a little and dampened.One key factor to sound distribution would be the material of the casing, i.e. cheap plastic with a gap between the case and the plug wouldn't contain the sound very well. So a little tip would be to seal any crevices and around the case/plug to keep sound waves from escaping your ear!I would also recommend using the rubber plugs as these will take the shape of your ear, containing the sound.
How to make sure nobody can hear anything when I'm listening music through my headphones
Well this is a very tricky question. I would also recommend if u can wear the rubber material headset as they tend to fit into to your ears perfectly. But apart from that u really wouldn't know if someone's already looking at u for the noise coming out of your headsetTry using the headset at home and check if it's too noisy even when it's plugged into your ears. If the sound is still coming out, ul have to think of alternatives to fulfill ur requirement  
What is the most efficient way to fold a map?
After some research, I have found another great way to fold a map, called the Miura fold.The Miura fold comprises just two steps. In the first one, you fold the map in 5 parts, like a long accordion. Now you fold again in 7 parts like an accordion, but slightly turned. An image might help:Source of the imageFolding it in this way may seem strange, but now you can unfold it with just one movement, pulling from opposite corners. Furthermore, you can fold it again in the same way, just doing the opposite movement (an animation is shown in both links).Extra: The Miura fold is named after a Japanese astrophysicist, who designed this fold to use in the folding of solar panels in satellites.

How to make sure nobody can hear anything when I'm listening music through my headphones
Use your smartphone to record the sounds.  Start by placing the device next to your ear as you listen to music in your headphones, then gradually move the phone further from your ear to get an idea of how far the headphone's sound travels.  You can play back the recording to get an idea of what other people might hear.  You should also establish a control sound, like your normal speaking voice, and record that as well.  That way you can reference the headphones sounds to the control sound.  pro-tip: use something other than the recording phone as the source for music in your headphones.

How can I eat my bagel when I lack a knife to cut it?
Your car keys might work in a pinch (for cutting anyhow).  Clean them thoroughly first, of course.  For spreading, a plastic spoon works just as well as a knife.  Failing that, you can always use your finger for spreading.  A bit messy, and unhygienic if others are sharing your cream cheese, but otherwise effective.

How to keep colour in clothes?
New denim clothing they may have "loose dye" in them, so yeah wash them several times in cold water to wash the loose dye out, from then on you can wash them with your other clothes, but I'd recommend washing them with dark colours and turning them inside out stops them rubbing against the other clothes and rubbing off the dye. That's all I can suggest.

How could you get a chair with very high arm rests with large surface area parallel to ground?
Most chairs today are made and designed for the greatest comfort while seated. There are actual equations that can find the best ergonomic design specifics for a persons stature.   In regards to your question it sounds to me as if you would prefer to sit with your arms at shoulder level? If so I'd just like to suggest that a person with knowledge in physiology or ergonomics should be consulted for advice as to any adverse repercussions sitting in this position may have to the body (specifically the shoulder/neck parts).   So modifying an existing chair so the arms are about 12-14 inches higher (or the seat is 12-14 inches lower) is the challenge.   My first thought was imagining a chair-type that would fit your design standards. It took some scanning and than I thought of a few summers in Maine at a friends cabin. The 'Adirondack'-style chair is extremely close to your specifications. With some simple design modifications to the arms and cleaver woodworking skills it shouldn't take very long to construct the chair of your dreams.

How to cut open a pita bread?
Heat the pita until it's soft. Make a small slit in one end with a serrated knife. Then insert fingers and work open the rest of it.
How to cut open a pita bread?
Put it down flat on the counter, put you knife down, flat on the counter.Put / poke the knife into the (heated) pita and cut it open. Because of the handle the blade itself will be lifted from the counter just enough to be in the middle of the height of the pita.The knife will be stable and the pita as well. This is a proven technique (by me :-).
What's the best way to deal with a low sun when driving?
Personally, I find that my brow protrudes just enough that I can turn my face downwards then raise my eyes to see the road ahead with the sun blocked by my brow bone. Most people I suggest this to say it doesn't work though, so maybe I have a little more Neanderthal DNA than most.Sunglasses always seem to make it worse in my experience.
How can I effectively organize disparate files?
After some searching I found an excellent system. Obviously, you probably need to start with a filing cabinet, but alphabetical order won't help much because of all the different files, and for one credit card related file, you might put "Credit card" and on another you might put "Amazon card", and they would get filed completely differently regardless of the heading you put on them. I've found that using differently colored hanging file folders as seperators works well for me, I have several simple one word headings for various subjects on the colored folders, while items of that subject type go behind the folder. I went ahead and cut the colored folders in half - I don't want to file directly into those folders, they are simply organizers. Here is a photo of my example. Hope it helps anyone with the same issue.
How can I eat salad without making a mess?
Always take 10% food less on plate than it's capacity. Plate - In case of salads, salads are often loose. Put each item on your plate so that when you apply dressing/spices/toppings they are distributed to each item. While eating - Take use of knife to push the salad onto your fork forming your desired stack which should be in manageable size to pick up and eat (this is helpful when you have to be less casual and be more in etiquette)Casually, you can dispense with the stabbing and try scooping. This is my preferred method (when not in public). It involves swooping into the salad, lifting out a platform of leaves with a few salad accouterments balanced precariously on top, and getting it into your mouth before it all tumbles back into the bowl.This would also be a helpful article hereThank you.
How can I eat salad without making a mess?
Sometimes salads are more easily eaten out of a bowl or other container with sides without spilling over. See if they make such dishware available in other sections of the cafeteria. If the cafeteria has soup (for example), you may find some bowls there. Look around; you may be able to find alternative tableware in other sections of the cafeteria. Alternatively, you may be able to bring your own (if they allow that). You'll be much less likely to spill using a bowl or a larger container than a tiny plate.

How can I get access to Supermarket 'membership' discounts without signing up for a card?
Most checkout systems will allow you to enter a phone number, in lieu of presenting an actual physical card. While you can guess at a number by using famous numbers like 867-5309 or 555-5555 with a local area code, I find a much more reliable method is to use my smartphone to look up the phone number of the store at which I'm shopping.Since most stores have a 'store card' tied to the stores phone number, you can just enter this number at checkout, and it will often work just fine.
How to peel an orange?
One thing I have found to work is to just cut the orange in four 'quadrants' (use 'vertical cuts, not 'horizontal' ones). The pieces can then be peeled by hand from the corners.Another method is to just get enough 'yellow' off from a band around the 'equator', then slice it in half and then eat it from the edges. When you have eaten enough you can turn it inside out.Some of the oranges these days can also be peeled almost like tangerines.
How to peel an orange?
I really like the Tupperware Orange Peeler. It is used by dragging the hook end around the orange skin, which opens the peel up all the way to the flesh of the orange. Then it's a simple matter of getting under the skin with the flat end, then peeling the skin off with your fingers. It's a really handy tool.Here's a couple available on amazon.com

How to peel an orange?
That question has been asked on cooking.stackexchange before, and the answer by Jolenealaska (and originally by blogger E is for Eat) quite qualifies as a life hack:Basically, you cut off both ends of the orange, make a vertical cut along one side, and then unroll the whole orange.I have tried this myself and it works, however results may vary depending on type and freshness of the orange.There is a nice animation of the whole process in the original blog postAnother quick way is to eat the orange while standing in the shower. Peeling is a lot quicker if you don't have to avoid a mess. I have never tried this myself, but the process is apparently quite enjoyable for some, there is even a subreddit dedicated to eating oranges  in the shower, with tons of pictures. (warning: if you click on this link, confirm you are over 18, and then open selected posts, you may, surprisingly enough, see naked people eating an orange in the shower)
How can I get access to Supermarket 'membership' discounts without signing up for a card?
At most of our local stores, the cashiers keep a card at the checkout counter. I think it may be mostly for people who forget their own card, but I've found that if I'm honest & just say I'd like the same discounts without having to register, they run that card through. 
How can I get access to Supermarket 'membership' discounts without signing up for a card?
I visit Las Vegas once a year and sure enough never remember to prior year's card. So I just go up to the service desk and ask for a new card and say "I'll fill in the form later and bring the form back next time as I'm in a rush now".Always been given a card and it always works. Never returned a form and even the prior year's cards work when I remember to take them. You probably don't get all discounts but the ones on the shelf for carrying a card always work.
How to peel an orange?
I have found I can reliably peel the entire orange without splitting any of the inner sliceswithout causing dripsquicklyI do this by starting at the tip where the stem was attached.  If my thumb nail is long enough, I can dig it into the fillet between the 'nub' for the stem and the globe of the fruit.  Or, I can gently use a tool.  I only need to get the nub separating in one direction, then I can peel it of in a spiral.  I maintain a breaking angle that does two things: maintain an even-width separation of the peelavoid strain that rips the slices' skin (causing a leak)The trick of this is really to take small tears of the rind - about ~20deg. arc (or 1/16 the diameter).  This will let you re-adjust to deviation the the rind. When you approach the equator of the orange you can pull around 45deg of rind at a time, but if you get into that groove then you'll take too much when you reach the other end, and you'll tear a slice or break the rind strip.  It's usually easy to 'recover' and continue peeling, but you'll probably cause a slice to leak, in order to get started.At this point the whole rind is off, and you can gently pull the slices apart individually. Pull 'pole to pole and you won't get drips.  Then pull each slice off the rest by pulling along the inner straight portion of the slice.  Pull evenly along that [which used to be] the axis, and be delicate of the breaking angle here, and you won't get any drips.Your hands will get a bit 'oily' from the orange rind, but you won't ever get them wet-sticky.  Remember to 'settle' the orange rind down into one hand, so that you make a little 'basket' for the slices that you have yet to eat.  This will keep everything as neat, clean and sanitary as was the orange rind and your hands when you started.What's best is that I need no tools.
How do I eat from a bowl without needing to clean it?
If you have an extra bit of time, you can reserve some of your morning drink and add it to the bowl after eating.  Just 2 tablespoons at most.  Swirl this around the bowl to coat the reaming food and then use your spoon to scrape down the sides.  You can do this in one continuous motion by holding the spoon steading, and rotating the bowl against it, like you're 'lathing' the bowl.  It's easier if you use a spatula.This works well with milk if your breakfast was oatmeal.The remainder can be wiped with a napkin, cloth, or left until washing all is convenient.
How can I remove the smell of spoiled milk from my fridge?
Yes, this happens so many times in our lives everyday. Not just milk, but with anything that we may leave too long in the refrigerator tends to leave a pungent smell after its get spoiled, especially given the fact the the fridge remains closed all the time. Now the trick is to eradicate the odour from the fridge. The best options for this are citrus fruits. Lime and oranges are perhaps the best solutions for this problem. Place a few orange peels in the fridge, make sure they are fresh for maximum effect.Alternatively, you could keep a small open container, with freshly squeezed lime juice near the vents of the fridge. Or you could cut a few pieces of fresh lemons/ lime and place them near the vents.Citrus smell always overpowers other odours. But make sure you replace the peels regularly as the peels tend to dry up (by then it loses all its fragrance).NOTE: BE SURE TO THROW OUT THE MILK, ALTHOUGH IT MAY APPEAR TO BE AN OBVIOUS SOLUTION, YOU SHOULD DO THAT FIRST.

What can I use to replace a missing battery cover?
Even easier than the cardboard mentioned by Adam is paper, because that's always available. By folding a sheet of paper enough times you can get any thickness you want, by folding creatively you can even get different thickness in different places. Use tape to secure it. Make sure to cover the entirety of the paper with tape, otherwise any part of the paper that comes into contact with skin while holding the remote will start to crumble and make a mess after a few months. Normal scotch tape (transparent adhesive tape) will do.Keep in mind that ripping at the ends of the tape seems to be part of human nature, so you may need to replace it occasionally.

How can I eat salad without making a mess?
Don't get big items such as lettuce leaves and it shouldn't be as messy.  You can even eat it with a spoon.At my job, we once had a catered salad bar for lunch but the caterer forgot the lettuce.  We all filled our bowls up with our favorite vegetables and toppings and didn't miss the lettuce at all.  Now I often skip the lettuce even when it's available.
What is the most efficient method to tackle pebble in sandal?
The simplest way to prevent pebbles under your foot is to wear a form of sandal with enclosed heel, toe, and instep.  It's called a "shoe" or, in a more extreme form, a "boot".  Shoes, and especially boots, are much more resistant to pebble (and, to a lesser extent, sand) getting under the foot.
How can I remove the smell of spoiled milk from my fridge?
Undiluted tomato juice - wipe the whole of the fridge over with it, including the racks and shelves, then wipe it off, and use a clean cloth with clean water as a final step.Personally, I think its quicker to do a proper fridge clean, but you'll need Milton or sterilizing fluid (such as that used for babies bottles). Dilute according to the instructions, use a clean cloth in the solution, wipe over the entire fridge, wash the racks and shelves and anything else you can remove that isn't food. No need to rinse off, just dry the interior with a dry cloth afterwards.
How can I keep glasses free of fogging from my breath, when wearing ski mask in cold weather?
Consider a different type of mask, one that leaves your mouth and nose uncovered and thus won't channel your moist breath onto your cold lenses.  Yes, it'll let your face get a little colder, but that's the trade off here.
How to keep an inclined driveway clear of snow?
Get a heavy, reinforced plastic tarpaulin large enough to cover the driveway (or multiple standard tarps, lapped with the ones toward the top of the hill over the lower ones), and make sure it's laid out before the snow gets well started.  Once the snow has stopped, find the bottom corners of each tarp and drag the tarp down slope, taking the snow with it.  Once it's clear of the driveway, drag the corners back over the tarp to clear the snow off the tarp itself.
How can I keep glasses free of fogging from my breath, when wearing ski mask in cold weather?
Get hold of an oxygen mask or similar, and attach rubber sheet to act as an "in-only" check valve on the exhaust vents.  Connect a piece of tubing to the oxygen inlet, and route that tube down your neck and into your coat.  Your exhalations will go in a location that won't fog your glasses.
How can I keep glasses free of fogging from my breath, when wearing ski mask in cold weather?
From cycling experience (read: significant breathing activity and wind. And once standing at traffic lights, the wind which usually blows away the wet breath is gone and glasses tend to fog immediately). I didn't find a way to keep the nose covered. i.e. use a ski mask designed to cover mouth and nose which is a bit generous in the size of the eye whole and pull the lower rim under your nose. Otherwise you'll always have small gaps next to your nose which perfectly channel the air upwards.Second ingredient is train to breath in the right direction. Sounds pretty dull, and is annyoing in the beginning, sorry for that. Anyway, depending on what your "neutral jaw position" is (assuming mouth breathing) your exhaust air goes horizontally or slightly upwards or slightly downwards. Try to find a comfortable new neutral position, slightly more opened, the jaw slightly more back and you don't fog your glasses. (really really not much, just a slightly different neutral position. No force, nothing uncomfortable. The annoying thing is that it takes concentration in the beginning because a single breath in upwards and your glasses are white).Leaving the field of ski masks, these stiff neoprene face masks for mountainbiking (these were the first i found on google) are worth considering. Also worn lower than intended by the manufacturer! I use them as a "stiff scarf" protecting the lower face from wind, due to its stiffness it cannot slip down even if you move your head in all directions. Eventually I switched to those and keep the skimask for really really cold days. Crucial aspect: not the neutral looking soft ones which are sold for winter cycling, but the stiff ones with drawings to look badass … preposterous, I know, but if the manufacturers don't get the target groups right, what can I do
How to reduce Dust in an appartment - use sticky tape?
I have made a research about dust at home, because it is a reason for alergic reactions. And here is what I've found:Common sources of dust:clothes, blankets, and other fabric which releases tiny pieces in the air when we move themold newspapers and magazines or other paper which degrades over time and also produce dusthuman skinanimal skin, hair, feathersdust coming from outside with the air through doors and windowsdirty shoes. The wet dirt which becomes dust when driedItems that collect lots of dust over time are:carpetsblanketsfluffy covers of furniturecurtainsWhen you move around in your room you put in the air the dust which lays on the floor or on chairs, tables, beds. To reduce all this dust you have to clean it regularly. When all those surfaces are clean there will be less dust in the air.The best solution is to remove all the carpets, fluffy covers, heavy curtains. Instead cover the floor with laminate or other hard material which can be cleaned with wet microfiber cloth.If you don't want to say goodbye to your carpets then you have to vacuum them twice a week and beat them outside each two or three months. Clean the floor and the furniture with wet microfiber cloth when you spot traces of accumulated dust.Remove all old newspapers and magazines.Keep your clothes in a wardrobe. Pack in boxes or bags the clothes which you don't wear in the current season.
How can I get access to Supermarket 'membership' discounts without signing up for a card?
There are many ways, though in some cases it depends on the store policy and/or their staff.You can just ask for a card, without saying anything about agreeing to fill out the form. I have done this many times, and unless it's a credit card, Radio Shack, an actual membership with a fee like Costco, or a department store or something, I have never (at supermarkets or the non-drug parts of drug stores) seen staff want me to fill out the form before using it. It would just slow them down to wait for you to fill it out, and even when there is no one behind me in line, staff have given me cards and even encouraged me not to fill out the form.You can say you don't have a card, and many staff will use their own card, or the register's card.You can ask your friends and family if they have such a card, and whether they mind if you use their number for it (usually the phone number). The cards usually come in family packs anyway with four or more cards for each form, so they might even have a spare card to share with you.You can also trade/share cards with your friends, or strangers, or use cards you find lying around. I wouldn't recommend giving away cards to untrusted people IF they have your actual information, however, as both stores and law enforcement may try to use shopping history as evidence in lawsuits and criminal charges. (All the more reason to not give out your information, though.)
How to reduce Dust in an appartment - use sticky tape?
In the spirit of providing simple lazy solutions, you may want to consider a vacuuming robot. These can be configured to remove all dust from the floor daily. If the dust stays on the floor it only needs a small amount of wind and it will enter the air again.These only work reasonably well if the flat satisfies a long list of constraints, so they're not always a good solution.
How to peel an orange?
A way to do this without any (artificial) tools and without any wastage of orange (unlike in the accepted answer) is to use your teeth: Put the orange in your mouth and sink your incisors into the skin of the orange until you feel them penetrate the skin into the interior of the orange. Then, simply pull the orange away from your teeth and your teeth will peel away the skin. Once you have a piece torn away from the orange, the rest of the skin is easy to pull off with your fingers.
How to peel an orange?
I use my fingers/nails to peel oranges (and I have peeled a lot - I consume a few of them almost every day). If the orange is soft it's easy, hard ones take some dedication and sometimes I use a pencil to make the initial puncture and go from there, but I always get the job done.If some of that white inner peel is left on the orange, I eat it - it's tasteless anyway so why bother removing it?
What can I use to rejoin porcelain broken pieces?
An experienced hand with slow-setting two-part epoxy (sometimes called araldite) is probably perferred over cyanoacrylate, but the water-thin super glue would be the best second choice.For epoxy, you'd ensure the glue is mixed thoroughly, apply a thin coat to one surface, join the parts and clamp them in place, ignoring glue that squeezes out of the joint (it'll be easy to remove from the glossy glazed surface after it cures).  Don't disturb the joint until the full curing time has passed, and keep it in a warm room (above 20 C).  Once fully cured, the excess glue can be easily chipped off the glossy surface and carefully trimmed even with the glaze with a razor blade or similar thin, sharp blade.For thin super glue, you'd join the parts dry, apply a minimum drop of glue at the join, and let it draw into the joint.  If the joint area is large, you may need a second drop.  Curing may take minutes, rather than seconds, on a non-porous material, but can be accelerated by breathing your moist, warm breath on the joint.  Be careful not to use too much; it's difficult to remove cleanly, even from glossy surfaces, and there's a hazard of gluing your fingers to the statue.The down side of this is that either glue will preclude a second try with the other, so it may be sensible to intentionally break a cheap item of the same material, to gain practice gluing.
How do I apply cold solid spreads (butter/cheese) evenly on breads/sandwiches in a short time?
To soften butter,microwave, [This method works best for softening butter to use as a spread.]place the butter in a microwave-safe dish and microwave on 30 percent  power (defrost) for 15 seconds. (This will not melt the butter)Warm water bathIf still in hurry, Set the butter over a warm water bath.  **Cut up the butterDivide and rule method - cut the butter block into small chunks.  Smaller chunks will rapidly absorb outer heat/ release inner  cold compared to bigger chunk.There are other methods like below which may take more time than above methods, Beat it: Use electric mixer to beat the butter block and get job done.Pound the butter: Store the butter block into a locked bag and use roller on the bag to flatten the butter. It will give you slim block but still cold.
How can I wear my headset and glasses in a way that doesn't hurt?
Pad the temple covers with a foam pad intended for that purpose, or with a foam rubber pen cover. BTW, I find wearing the temples over my ears for a while gives a break from the constant pressure on the head itself.You might get an inexpensive second pair of glasses and bend the temple pieces so they can be attached to the headset frame or cushions, perhaps with glue.
How can I remove the smell of spoiled milk from my fridge?
Vinegar. Vinegar is an excellent cleaning tool. Clean the entirety of the fridge with vinegar (especially the place where the milk was), and then wait. The vinegar smell might be even worse than spoiled milk, but it will leave about a day or two after the cleaning.
Headphones are uncomfortable to wear
Sounds as if you're experiencing some kind of dermatological skin reaction, probably to the black material used over the padding. If this is the case, you'd expect a lot of irritation and redness on the skin as well as blistering, and would mean you're hypersensitive to whatever it is, and you need to get new headphones which do not include that material. Otherwise, you could try sticking some other, natural material such as cotton over the padding so it's not in contact with your skin.There is an alternative possibility though - it could be because the earphones are so tight they're exerting undue pressure on your ears, which would also explain the pain and possibly the blister, where the skin's been rubbed or compressed too much for too long. In which case, you need a new headset which fits more comfortably.
Fixing a micro usb socket.
What you describe sounds very much as if the electrical contacts inside the phone's USB socket have gotten bent, or the connection to the phone's circuit board is damaged.  If the latter, a skilled person with the correct tools (very fine tipped soldering tool and thin electronic solder) might be able to repair the board, but if the former, the only reliable repair would be to replace the circuit board on which the socket is mounted.  With a phone a generation or two old like the Note 4, it's likely this can be done at reasonable cost with tested used parts if you can do the work yourself, but it's likely the labor cost will make it more cost effective to replace the entire phone if you have to pay someone to do the work.To prevent a repeat of this sort of damage, be sure not to apply any force to the USB cable plug other than pushing it directly into the socket, or pulling it straight out.  Any significant force bending the plug toward either flat surface will tend to either bend the contacts or shell, or break the connections to the circuit board.
How can I remove the smell of spoiled milk from my fridge?
Clean your fridge. Ideally gradually use up what's in it so it's nearly empty already, then:Turn it offEmpty it outTake out all the shelves and drawersUsing antibacterial spray, or other cleaning agents of your choice, wipe down the entire interior, making sure you get into all the nooks and crannies.Take the opportunity to make sure the drainage hole at the back is clean and clear too.Wipe it down with a damp sponge to rinse out all the cleaning chemicals.Leave it overnight with the door open to dry.Clean the shelves and drawers with soapy water in the sink.Make sure it's completely dry before turning it back on.I like to do this once a year regardless of the smell. Keeping your fridge clean is just good housekeeping.If this seems to be a lot of effort to you, read this article which goes into quite how much bacteria like to live in a cupboard that's essentially a store for slowly rotting food.
How can I humidify a room without a humidifier?
Hang out your laundry to line dry in your house rather than putting it in the dryer. This will release a lot of moisture into the air.

How can I humidify a room without a humidifier?
If the room is small, you can create a solution using a bucket of water and a few kg of table salt (sodium chloride or potassium chloride).Dump a large amount of salt into the bucket, and add water until the salt will absorb no more water. This is what's called a saturated salt solution.The solution will attempt to maintain the humidity level of the room at around 75%.Additionally, you can use a bucket of water, a towel and a fan to do this more easily.
How can I wear my headset and glasses in a way that doesn't hurt?
I've been an eyeglass wearer and headset (as well as hearing protection) user for about thirty years. Here's what I've learned:Frame thicknessEverything depends on the thickness of the arms of your glasses. Thus if you have another set of glasses with thinner frames, you might want to wear those with the headset. Otherwise, of course, this point isn't much of a lifehack.Headset tensionThe tighter the headset "squeezes" your ears, the more painful it will be. Do what you can to adjust your headset so that the top of your head bears most of the force, so you can relax the grip on your ears somewhat.PositionAgain, adjust the headset so that the earpiece foam doesn't ride on top of your ears. The earpieces on the headset you linked appear to be large enough for that, but I could be wrong. Still, try repositioning them forward and up somewhat—small amounts until you find the most comfortable spots.Give your ears a breakThis is doubly true if you have the volume turned up, but that's another topic! Take your headset off periodically such as in-between rounds (if you're gaming), and get into the habit of just moving it around slightly every few minutes, before it really starts to annoy you. That will let the circulation back into the parts of your ear that have been put under the most pressure, which will make a big difference. Our ears don't have much bloodflow to begin with, so they can always use a little help in that department.Another way to give your ears a break is to simply slide one earpiece off of one of your ears, and then switch ears. Obviously you bought a stereo headset for a reason, but if you don't need positional audio or stereo sound at the moment, this can be another handy trick to add.So what's the "best" strategy?All of the above. The Stack Exchange way is to have a clear answer, and my clear answer is, the more different ways you can take a little bit of stress off of your ears, the better you'll feel. Like I mentioned, our ears aren't particularly good at pumping blood, which is why moving the pressure points around is the right answer, in my opinion.
How to reduce the air humidity in a room?
Products such as damp-rid and dries-air pull moisture from the air via a chemical called calcium chloride. They are very effective but a little expensive. That chemical is also the main ingredient in some brands of ice melt crystals, which are a little cheaper but come in big bags. I use the ice melt. I fill a disposable plastic cup abut halfway with it and set it near the windows. Use as many of these as you need to do the job. As the crystals liquefy you will need to replace them. I've heard you can dry it out in a stove or something but have never tried it. You can cover them with a cheese cloth and a rubber band if you are worried about them spilling. Also after you open the bag be sure to seal it. I put it in a bucket with a tight lid.
How can I humidify a room without a humidifier?
'Traditional' humidifiers look like this:It's just a ceramic container with a hook that hangs over the radiator. Fill it with water, and the water evaporates as the radiator heats it. You can emulate this with a dish or bowl hanging on your radiator. If you have the space the easiest option is to place a container on top of the radiator.It was not uncommon to add scents to the water, like lavender; this supposedly helped combat the 'stuffiness' of the room.

An ordinary air conditioner dehumidifies the air as it cools.  If you don't need cooling, you can let the machine's hot air exhaust mix with the cold, and you'll get a slight heating effect, but the water will still be pulled out of the air by condensation on the cold evaporator coils.You can get small air conditioners for under $100, though you might have to improvise a bit in terms of mounting to use it this way.
How can I humidify a room without a humidifier?
I'm going to elaborate on Umber Ferrule's answer. Since my estate is rather cheap, I can afford to dedicate a couple of square feet to pretty large polyethylene basin like this: Several things to consider:evaporation happens at the surface of water, so area is significant parameter here (this makes square bowl/basin much better than round one)it works best at open space with air circulation present allowing humid and dry air to mix freely
Fixing a micro usb socket.
I have known people who may have dropped their devices while plugged in to have this problem. What sometimes happens is the plug will put pressure on the port and bend the support tab away from the contacts ever so slightly.My wife's phone did this and I took a dental tool I keep in my shop and nudged the little tab in the port ever so gently (it CAN break off) towards the contacts and it helped the cord make better contact with things.  Try that and see what your results are before making a more invasive repair.
How to remove ice from windshield
I've used the spray cans of de-icer and they work great.  Looking at the ingredients, they used forms of alcohol to get the job done.  So I tried the spray of 2:1 rubbing alcohol to water and it worked great.  I know some people who have even added it to their washer fluid tank directly.  I would advise against using warm or hot water on the window.  You may get away with it 10 times, but I have seen someone use that method and the temperature difference was so far apart and the change in temp so quick that the glass cracked.  
How can I remove the smell of spoiled milk from my fridge?
One of the best methods I've found to get rid of smells in ANYTHING is to use some coffee grounds.  Place the coffee in some bowls spaced around the fridge and within about 2 days the smell will be gone.I've used it to get smells out of microwaves, cars and even have used it to get smells off my hands by rubbing it into my hands (in this case I used used grounds that were still damp).You'll be skeptical at first, but once you try it, you'll be sold.
How can I humidify a room without a humidifier?
Use a rice cooker full of water. Unlike most electric kettles it will continue to run even with the water boiling, but will turn off (or to a lower "keep warm" state) when the water runs out and the temperature goes above 100°C.You will need to be careful though; it can work too well and turn your walls into slush. Use a really small rice cooker unless it's a really large room.

How can I get access to Supermarket 'membership' discounts without signing up for a card?
At a number of stores I've gotten them from, if you simply say that you are in a hurry and will fill out the application later, they will scan it and let you go on your merry way.  Then, just load that into an app on your phone (I use KeyRing too) and forget the physical card.  That is how the cards are that many stores use at the registers.  They often times are not registered and we just ones grabbed from the stack and used.  At least at the few I worked at that is how it was done.  It was also advised to have them scanned if the customer did not have one right away - the point was to make sure the customer got through the line as fast as possible to speed up checkout times.  Some places like Kroger, track the times of cashiers, so they will scan the store card to help speed things up.
How can I effectively organize disparate files?
I used to keep a three ring-binder of all my statements.  Each year, I would start a new binder each year.  Collecting statements for 10+ years (and rarely looking at them, I decided to reorganize.  For me, it was just too much hassle to sort and file everything.First, I would ask if you need to keep everything.  Look at http://publications.usa.gov/epublications/keeprecords/keeprecords.htm to see how long you should keep common documents and where you should keep them.  (E.g., some important documents should kept in a safe deposit box or a fire safe.)Second, ask yourself how frequently you need to retrieve documents and do you care if similar statements are together.  Since I rarely need to look back for documents, I now use magazine holders.  I use one for each year and print out a "cover sheet" to say what year is in that box.  I keep the current year's box on my desk.  After I'm done with a statement, it goes in the box.  This makes my filing quite quick and easy.  At the end of the year, I take the one off my desk and put it on a bookshelf, shred the contents of the oldest box, print a new cover sheet, and put that box on my desk.

How to peel an orange?
EDIT: Video link of this method (thanks to leonbloy)This way is guaranteed to work with all but the most stubborn (really old) oranges. Moreover, your hands will not get sticky! ...And it's quick.Cut off the top and bottom of the orange--but only the peel! Do not cut off any of the actual inner flesh.Cut from the top of the orange around to the bottom, but don't cut too deep! The knife should not puncture the actual inner flesh!Repeat step 2 equally around the orange so you have 5 or 6 cuts or so (depends on size of the orange, and as you get more experienced, you can do it in as little as 3 cuts).Now, just peel the peel off using your fingers. From the top, gently wedge your fingernail (or the tip of the blade) between the peel and the inner flesh and pry off the peel. After you've removed this first peel "slice", remove the subsequent peel "slices" off in the same manner until there is no more peel (you can use these peel "slices" as small plates for your orange wedges as you eat them!).Once all the peel is off, very gently nudge the tips of your thumbs on the top of the orange and pry it open. Then, simply separate the slices with your fingers, putting the slices in your cool orange peel plates from the previous step.This process actually takes less time than it takes to read what I've written above!As a side note, orange peel is edible and some people enjoy eating it raw. Others make candy out of the peel. Others use the peel as zest in cooking--it's very nice in cake to remove the "egg" taste.
How can I eat my bagel when I lack a knife to cut it?
What is wrong with you all? Have you forgotten about MacGyver?!All it takes to solve this problem is one of each of the following:Paper clipPenRubber bandOnce you have secured the above items, follow these steps:Unwind the paper clip and STAB the bagel where you will begin cutting it. Then proceed to saw your way through it and around it until you have a nice bagel cut in two. Pop these two slices in the toaster.Dismantle the pen, leaving only the long housing piece. Wash this piece and dry it.Once your bagel is done toasting, spread your desired spreads on the bagel using your clean spreader from the previous step.Enjoy!But wait... what about the rubber band, you say? To be honest, we'll have to ask MacGyver why we'd need a rubber band here! Nonetheless, this is as MacGyver-like as it gets without the real MacGyver. For the meantime, I guess you can just wear the rubber band around your wrist as a bracelet as you eat your tasty bagel.P.S. After you've devoured your meal, bend paper clip back in place, wash the pen housing piece and reassemble the pen, take off your rubber band bracelet, and return these three items to their places before anyone finds evidence of what took place and starts hailing you as the office hero!

Remove dust bubble from glass screen protector?
Recently I also tried to apply a glass protector and failed terribly, but somehow with the help of a friend I rescued it and removed all bubbles. The trick is using cello-tape. Attach a cello-tape to your screen protector, and slowly lift it, once its done, take a piece of the tape and attach it between your thumb and index finger, and tap on the glass protector where you can spot dust particles. The glue on the tape will make the dust cling on to the tape and make your protector free of the dust. Repeat this for all the dust particles, and slowly put back the protector. Hope that helps.

Cheap way to get a clear plastic coffee table? For lying underneath it and using a windows 8.1 tablet on top
Goodwill and other "second hand" stores may have something similar for a good price.Additionally (and this may sound odd), drive around the neighborhoods near your college where the students live. College students often put furniture out on the sidewalks when they're done with it! Someone may have discarded a plastic coffee table that is just what you're looking for. It may need minor repairs, so be prepared for that. (I found an acoustic guitar with a broken neck this way. I just fixed the neck with a wood screw and played it for years.)

Colouring electrical wire
Are the electrical light sockets also colored? If they're then I would guess they would be made of a different material than the wire insulation. So the dye may work for one and not the other. I don't think wire insulation can be dyed but I cold be wrong.Honesty I would consider plasti-dip.  Comes in a dip type or spray on. It's flexible and you can buy it in various colors. It's thicker than a coat of dye or paint so the color you pick will not change based on the wires original color. Have you considered wrapping the wire in colored tape. This could get pricey but it's a simple solution.One last option is to buy wire loom in large quantities. This is relatively cheap compared to other suggestions and it can be bought in many colors. The split in the loom will be enough to pull each light out. Hope this helps

How to strip coating off of wires without a wire stripper
I have found that for me the quickest and easiest way to consistently strip wires is by using my telecommunication scissors. It takes a little practice to get the hang of applying just the right amount of pressure, but once mastered is the way to go. It is the preferred technique of stripping small gauge wires amongst the guys I work with. By small  gauge I am referring to 18 AWG and smaller. This technique also works well with stranded wire. With larger gauge wires, especially solid wire, say up to 10 gauge, I will use my "dykes", which is jargon for side cutting diagonal pliers. On the bigger wires, for like transformers or main breakers I will use a razor knife. I have seen quite a few fancy strippers in my time, but when it comes right down to it, normal hand tools work the best as they stay sharper and are more likely to be readily available when I need them. I hope this helps. Have a great day.     
What can I use to rejoin porcelain broken pieces?
My wife is an ardent crafter and uses many kinds of adhesives in various projects.  Her recommendation was a two-part epoxy. I checked around the web after she gave her answer, and found a cermaic repair site, which said:Many people ask us for advice and one of the most common questions is "Can I use Super or Crazy Glues to fix my broken ceramic? It’s so much easier than 2-part epoxies!" There is a misunderstanding about the difference between super glues and epoxy and they are therefore sometimes used interchangeably but, super glues and epoxy glue are different and have specific purposes.The article is a bit lengthy, but it concludes:[We do] not use super glues for ceramic repair and restoration – super glues are just not strong and durable enough. In most of our ceramic restoration ... we use high-end non-yellowing 5 minute clear epoxies.
How to stop biting my nails?
Get in the habit of carrying nail clippers in your pocket. Bring them with you everywhere you go. Rather than biting your nails, clip them instead. There's a good chance you'll develop a new compulsion – clipping your fingernails – but that's a big improvement over biting them.
Best way to clean dollar bills
American paper currency is very resilient. In fact, one of the tests that they do when designing new bills is to run them through a full wash/dry cycle, and then repeat over and again. Another is where they crumple and straighten the bill hundreds of times in an automated machine. I tried to find the documentary I once watched regarding the impressive battery of tests that bills go through, but I can't seem to find it now.Also, paper currency from most parts of the world can survive at least a few wash/dry cycles without fading. Simply stuff the bills in with your laundry, perhaps inside a sock that's tied up, and throw it in with color-safe detergent, fabric softener, on a cold/cold wash (cold wash, cold rinse), and it should get out almost any stains you can imagine, least of all pet urine. You can do that wash with all your other colors, although avoid doing so with freshly purchased red clothing, as it will cause your sock and the bills to be tinted red quite permanently.Finally, simply run it through a normal dryer cycle where your clothes get nice and dry. I personally use automatic drying cycles, which tend to take longer, but leave my clothing soft and nicely toasty. I'd like to mention that I have personally ran money through the full cycle on more than one occasion, and you couldn't tell the difference after they dried.
What are some quick ways to cool off at home, in extreme heat, if the electricity has gone out?
1.) Obtain a wire small animal cage.2.) Install an exercise wheel inside the cage.3.) Clip or tape several standard playing cards onto the exercise wheel in a manner of which the cards will encounter resistance to air as the wheel rotates.4.) Obtain a hamster or other similar, small, active critter.5.) House said critter within the wire cage along with sufficient food and water.When the critter gets bored he/she/herm/shim will jump up onto the inside of the exercise wheel and begin running. This will maintain rotational movement of the wheel, causing the playing cards to act as do the blades of a fan, producing air movement. Locate the cage in proximity to your head, close enough so that the air movements can be felt by your head. Talk to the critter while he/she/herm/shim is running so that he/she/herm/shim stays happy enough to want to keep running.
How to strip coating off of wires without a wire stripper
Any pair of nail clippers will work exactly the same as electronic side-cutters. Pinch the shielding of the wire at North-South and East-West points of the wire. The larger the wire, the more the shield will need to be pre-cut before you attempt to remove the shield. Hold tension on the clippers and pull back.I also always have a scalpel or craft knife nearby. For multi-conductor cable it's very good at negotiating through the various shielding layers. Just bend the cable over to tension the shield, and brush the blade gently over the shield. The tension will cause it to split. repeat as necessary. Never press too hard, as you don't want to nick the underlying layers.
Best way to clean butter from a knife
We have a dual basin sink. On one side I will leave a small amount of water with anti-bacterial dish detergent. Leave a sponge in the water for when you need it. This sponge can be used for cleaning up anything that isn't too oily or dirty, and won't smell due to the anti-bacterial agent in the soap.Alternatively, you can use a microfibre cloth ie. Enjo. As long as the butter is still cold, it will wipe off easily.
Remove an imprinted logo from an electric device
The logo appears to be printed to the underside of the bezel. You would need to remove the outer layer of the screen and replace the coating with something all black. An RC hobby shop would have replacement material to re-skin the screen. Removal of existing glue is best done with hot water followed by isopropyl alcohol. Note; this will most definitely void any warranty. 
How to stop snow from sticking to the shovel
The best cure is to use  a decent car wax in paste form. Best to wax it when  you first get the shovel but it works on old shovels just  fine. I have done this for 50 years on metal and plastic  shovels. I get a lot of snow where I live and I wax  em at the start of the season. Works great on snow plows also, helps keep them looking good and keeps the pitting & rusting to a minimum.Ballistol gun cleaner also works in a pinch. Spray or wipe it on shovel let it set for a few hours  and  buff it. This will also last the whole season...

How to heat up burritos, without the frozen middle
Burritos are one of the foods that will always reheat better in an oven. If you only have a microwave, pick up a microwave steamer, or rice cooker. The steam will do a much better job of delivering the heat into the food. This has the added benefit of not drying out the tortilla. 
How to test if humidity meter works
Get a plastic bottle and put an inch of table salt in the bottom. Keep adding water till the salt is fully covered. I'm not sure what your probe looks like. If it's a thick air sensor wrap plumbing tape (Teflon tape around the neck and wedge it in the mouth of the bottle. If it's the metal needle type, stab it into the bottle near the mouth. With the bottle sealed it should read around 75-78%. Just leave it somewhere temperature stable for a couple hours and check on it. There are other "humidity salts" for different RH. See here for measurement ranges

Book holder for paperbacks
How about using a paper clamp to hold either side together?
Book holder for paperbacks
A wire rack of the kind made for mail organization will do a fine job of holding paperbacks open, if they aren't too thick.  If you like to read the epics, you might need to get heavy wire cutters or a rotary tool and clip off one of the rack's wire arches to let the thicker book fit; you can use an unaltered slot to hold thinner books.
How to avoid pigeons eating my dog's food and pooping my car / front yard?
You can feed your dog in a cage made of metal net and a roof. It may have a door for the dog. This door can be like the ones which are like small door on home doors. I think they call them dog door flaps. This way the dog can enter to eat but the pigeons can't enter, they are not strong enough to push the door.
How to avoid pigeons eating my dog's food and pooping my car / front yard?
Move the fake cat around every so often, they're likely to be uncomfortable at the possibility it could be alive. I would otherwise suggest placing shiny wind chimes near the dog's bowl, the light reflecting and the sound may startle them away.Pigeons and many wild birds are deterred from things moving nearby that are bigger than them (flight over fight every time). So there are a few things you could try for trial and error such as the wind chimes and possibly a water sprinkler.Good Luck with the pest control!
Book holder for paperbacks
You can do a search of "book holders." I think most works best with hard-cover books, but certain models look like they will work well for paperback books as well, for example these two seem to have longer arms to keep the pages open ->
Book holder for paperbacks
This may sound odd, but if you have a glass-top end table, or set of glass shelves, and if you can remove the sheet of glass, then you could open the paperback book and place the glass on top of it on the counter. The weight of the glass will keep the pages open.
Book holder for paperbacks
Binder clips might work, but a chip clip might work even better. The length of the chip clip might be more suitable for keeping the book open.I don't happen to have a chip clip handy, but I just tested my theory with a pants hanger, which seemed to work fine, and might even be a better option still. (I think the style on the right might be better for protecting the book binding from damage.)

How to stop biting my nails?
I have just almost finished dealing with this for my 5 year old son. So here is a technique that worked. "Mavala Stop" is a clear nail coat. Believe me when I say the taste is so yucky that there is no way but to stop putting your nails into the mouth. It took my son couple of weeks to get rid of a habit that was destroying his nails and also bothering us quite a bit. The coat wears off in about 3 days, so replenish it until the habit stops or resurfaces. The customer reviews describe more and no doubt it is the number one product on Amazon for 'Nail growth'. My son's nails are growing back healthily once again. Good luck.http://www.amazon.com/Mavala-Stop-Biting-Sucking-0-3-Fluid/dp/B0000YUXI0

How can I remove the smell of spoiled milk from my fridge?
There are boxes of baking soda with tear away sides that have mesh underneath the cardboard. They are fantastic at absorbing smells and won't spill if you bump them over. 
How do I prevent furniture from leaving dents in the carpet?
Furniture coasters work well. You can also make a furniture coaster from scrap carpet by cutting them into squares (or whatever shape makes you happy). Place the coaster between the leg/foot of the furniture and the carpet. It will not prevent the dents, but will reduce them as the weight of the furniture is spread across the coaster.
How do I prevent furniture from leaving dents in the carpet?
Furniture coasters with several push-pins jammed into them might do the trick.Since the push pins stick out of the bottom of the furniture coaster, they will be what touches the floor, not the coaster. Since they are narrow, they will most likely slide between the upright threads of the "pile" of your carpet, so none (or very few) of those threads should be bent. And since there are multiple thumbtacks, the weight of the furniture and anybody sitting in it will be somewhat well distributed (as opposed to just using a single thumbtack to raise the furniture).You'll need to get pretty strong thumbtacks for this; plastic thumbtack heads may break. I'd imagine that metal or wood would be best. The heads should be as tall or almost as tall, as the length of your carpet's pile.

How to stop biting my nails?
Tried many of the suggestions here and the only thing that worked long term was taking supplemental vitamin D3. Your doctor can check your D levels. I take 2000 IU per day. Nails got stronger and the urge to pick at them went away. It was a totally unexpected benefit.
How can I dry my hair more quickly?
There's no magical hair drying machine just yet, so you will have to stick to the towel/hair dryer, however implementing the following steps will guarantee to dry your hair quicker.Always use conditioner after you shampoo, this will seal some moisture in your hair which helps keep it healthy. The conditioner will also lock the pores in your hair preventing any unnecessary water absorption making the task of drying a lot quicker and easier.Once you've washed your hair, whilst still in the shower/bath give your head a quick shake so there is no unwanted 'drippage' then tip your head upside-down and run your fingers through it so the hair is divided into separate sections and twist each section, wringing out any further excess water.By just grabbing a towel and drying your hair without performing steps 1 and 2, your towel won't be completely effective (for longer hair). Once a certain degree of moisture has been absorbed by the towel , finding a dry spot can be scarce and the current moisture on the towel won't allow any more to be absorbed. Once you have performed 1 and 2 procede with the towel drying with ends of your finger tips in a rotating motion, dividing the hair as much as possible.Blow dry your hair once section at a time, starting with the root. Whilst blow drying move your fingers through your hair and ruffle your hair constantly, dividing the hair up makes drying a lot quicker. If you prefer to use a brush, use a wide-tooth one so it's easy enough to run through consistently. I would also recommend blow drying with a quick dry product i.e. KMS California Free Shape Quick Blow Dry.Product recommendations: Microfiber towel and microfiber brush
Need take off nozzle to Reuse drinking water jug
A quick fix for this could be to cut a circle out of the top of the container.Then you can fill up from the top through the hole you've made without compromising the water seal around the actual nozzle.You could also place some tape around the hole and around the plastic circle you cut out to take away any sharp edges and also make a crude lid.
How to remove rust from tools
Electrolysis tank is the absolute best answer.  I found a pair of needlenose pliers in the ground when I was digging a fence post and used electrolysis on them.  They work like new and instead of removing metal, it adds metal back to the pliers.  It's not hard to set up, just grab some baking soda or detergent booster from the grocery store for a few dollars and use a car battery for the power source.  You can use a small container or even a gallon sized freezer bag!!  And voila, brand new pliers.

How can I apply and maintain pressure when mounting a mirror on a door?
Applying pressure is simple: cut the end of a long board a 45 degrees, glue a piece of thick plywood to the cut end. Prop the uncut end on the floor and the plywood, used to spread pressure, on the mirror. Hold the board in place with weights.However, I would not recommend double-stick tape to hold a glass mirror, because under the steady force of the mirror's weight, it will slowly pull away from the wall until the mirror crashes to the floor.
How can I apply and maintain pressure when mounting a mirror on a door?
Use some of these (they're good at spreading the pressure, much less likely to mar a finish than a typical clamp) to clamp a board against your mirror.
How can I apply and maintain pressure when mounting a mirror on a door?
I'm assuming this is an interior door....Take the door off the hinges.Lay the door on the floor.Place the mirror on the door.Place old books/newspapers/weights/cans of soup/etc... so that you don't have to apply any force.  Wait however long you like.Put door back up.This (a) makes sure that pressure is evenly distributed (if you distribute the weights evenly) and (b) pretty much cannot go wrong - not clamps to slide off, nobody to mistakenly open the door from the other side and so on.
How can I keep glasses free of fogging from my breath, when wearing ski mask in cold weather?
May sound strange but a little bit of spit on the inside of you glasses will stop them from fogging, divers use this to keep there masks from fogging. Also there are different products like this spray. But spit works just fine.
Can I use regular kitchen salt to my dishwasher?
Salt is used to regenerate the dishwasher ion exchange column. It is vital to use pure 100% NaCl without any other additions. This is guaranteed with all products on the market. To ease filling, and dilution it also has a somewhat coarser granularity but this is not decisive.It is possible to use any other pure NaCl-salt as a replacement but alas our table salt used for cooking isn't. There usually are several anticaking agents that would destroy the ion exchanger in our dishwasher.It is therefore not recommended to use table salt for a dishwasher.Note in addition: salt is usually added as a component of multi-function dishwasher tabs. In this case we do not need any salt in addition.
How can I apply and maintain pressure when mounting a mirror on a door?
Mount the mirror, then wrap string, twine, or fabric around the door and mirror, top to bottom and tie it off.  Make sure it's tight. Then, one at a time, insert cardboard sheets (cut out from boxes, etc) between the string and mirror until there's even pressure at the mounting tape points beneath the mirror.You can leave this in place for however long you like, and if the twine/string/fabric is thin enough it will allow you to continue to use the door normally.
How can I eat salad without making a mess?
Along similar lines to the wrap idea, you can try eating using bread rather than a fork. If you take a bit of pita, small tortilla, or some other soft flatbread, you can grab food with your hands, using the bread as a barrier between your hand and messy food. I recommend this primarily because your hands are far superior utensils to ordinary cutlery, in terms of keeping stuff from falling out. You'll find it easier to keep everything in a bite contained by using your hand rather than a fork, especially when dealing with a loose food like salad. The bread keeps your hands clean. 
How to stop biting my nails?
Biting your nails is likely be just a symptom of something else that is eating at you.My parents have always wanted me to stop it, gave me nail coat (which were not strong enough I guess), tried punishing me, etc. - none of those worked.20 years later I am still doing it, but at least now I know the background reason (which is not going to be fixed easily, but that's for another site).
How can I apply and maintain pressure when mounting a mirror on a door?
Get a large plastic bag, preferably quite thick plastic, and slide it over the door and mirror (maybe you need to remove one hinge pin?) Then tape with duct tape where the open end hangs loose on the door. Make as air tight a seal as possible. Next cut a corner off one of the closed ends of the bag and insert the end of your vacuum cleaner hose. Again, duct tape to make a good seal. Now run the vacuum, the bag will collapse and apply up to 14lbs per square inch of pressure uniformly over the whole area of the mirror. Depending upon how good your sealing is, you may only need to run the vacuum for a few minutes ever hour....otherwise not!
In ear headphones are painful to wear, increase comfort or convert to earbuds somehow?
I had the same issue for a very long time, and then I got these below. Their trick is likely to be that they use your whole ear to support their weight, hence the pressure is distributed, so it is not painful at all. They come in 3 sizes, maybe it worth a try.
How can I apply and maintain pressure when mounting a mirror on a door?
Take 2 pieces of timber of approximately the same length and sandwich the door and mirror between them like this:Screw or clamp the timber above and to the side: Leave the door open until you are ready to remove the whole thing.
How to turn on the motion sensor controlled light when you're in the toilet?
If the motion detector is actually next to your cubicle, then you are in luck - otherwise you might have to cross a few doors to get it light up again (happened to me, not funny).You can always throw out something, over/under the door, just be mindful not to throw anything you might need before you leave your post.Use the torch function on your mobile to cast some light outside of your cubicle - that might trick the sensor to think there is movement.

How to warm up milk for the baby during a trip?
Hand-warmers might do the trick, and they can be more space-efficient and portable than the boiling water.What kind to get obviously depends on how much stuff you need to heat and how often you need to do it; you can go for packets, which are relatively cheap, or an electrical warmer, which is a bit more sustainable for repeated use. 
Can I use regular kitchen salt to my dishwasher?
The salt is used in the Water Softener ("Ion Exchanger") which is built-in to the machine. I have a Water Softener for my entire house so I actually have the dishwasher's built-in softener switched OFF and therefore never have to fill it with salt.Obviously, that just means I have to fill the house Water Softener with salt instead.A few years ago I realised that here in the UK, we now pay 20% VAT (tax) on Water Softener salt but not on table salt because it is deemed a food product and not liable for the "luxury" tax. I decided to try using a bulk bag of catering salt in the softener.I first asked the manufacturer of the softener if it was OK to do it. They recommended NOT to, but could not really explain why. I tried adding about 10% of the granular salt to each refill with the large tablet salt I normally use.I have no idea why, but the machine started to behave strangely after a few fills with the table salt even though it was quite a small proportion each time. The softening action wasn't working and a sort of brown foam started appearing inside the softener. Also, the softened water started to taste of salt.Hence, I stopped using the culinary salt in my softener once that bag was gone and I suggest it's not a good idea to try it in a valuable dishwasher.The one tip I can recommend though is that you actually buy Water Softener salt for the dishwasher. It is exactly the same thing as you get in small bags from the supermarket - but you buy it in 25Kg bags for around £7 - probably around a fifth of the price you're paying at the moment. You just need to be careful because softener salt come in a variety of forms: granular, large granules (about 5mm), tablets (about 20mm-40mm) and blocks. I would have thought that either of the granular forms would be OK in a dishwasher.

Remove and prevent mildew from wallpaper
There are several things you can do. If you can open the window for some time, you can use hydrogen peroxide in a spray or white vinegar. After that you have to take care of the humidity, you should reduce it or mold will appear again.Some people use ozone generators to kill mold, but this is not a good idea if you live in this room, because ozone can be harmful for your lungs.For more information you can check this similar question 
How to warm up milk for the baby during a trip?
A completely electricity-/stove-free method would be storing the baby milk not in rigid bottles, but in zip-lock-type baggies as they are sold for storing expressed breast milk, for example. Slip the cool bag under your clothes and use your body heat to get it to temperature.It shoud warm up quite fast as the bag ensures that a comparatively thin layer of milk touches a large area of your skin. If you are moving, it also gets mixed a bit which warms it even faster.Bonus: You can be absolutely sure that you won't overheat the bottle, which can happen in a microwave if you are not very careful.
Remove and prevent mildew from wallpaper
Mildew is developed due to a lack of ventilation and sun light exposure which develops this horrible moisture that clings to your belongings and especially your walls!     First thing to remember is to open your windows every day if possible for at least an hour to circulate fresh air into the room and open the curtains/blinds too. Many of these modern windows have  a slider at the top to aid ventilation, otherwise I would suggest a small investment in a dehumidifier. E.g.     ElectriQ MD280  As for treating the mildew already on the walls, you need to be a little more delicate with wallpaper, first off I'd suggest heating up or air conditioning the room to dry the affected areas then grab a sponge and washing-up liquid and wipe over.   Then use some chlorine bleach to rid any left over spores. Make sure you don't over-saturate the wallpaper as this could put air pockets in the wallpaper.  If the mildew is really bad it may be worth calling an expert who can assess your home, treat the mildew and provide you with professional advice. Just remember to keep the room well ventilated and open a window if you have a group of people in the room. Good luck!
How to deal with neighbors/street cars playing loud music?
For many years, I've used a recording of surf sounds playing on repeat to blanket outside noise -- primarily when I sleep, but it will work any time.  An air conditioner or fan can do similar service.  This isn't very practical while (for instance) watching TV, but the TV has its own volume control.
How to deal with neighbors/street cars playing loud music?
Little bit of advice. It's not a 'Life Hack' you need, you should be able to live in your house as a home and not be forced to find contraptions to get around this problem, they will only cost you money/annoyance.I had that problem and I love loud music, but I was getting it very late at night when I have to go to work. All it took was a knock on the door a few words (which didn't work) then a delightful threat of physical violence or a trip to non-emergency police. Let's face it, it's anti-social behavior really. Understandingly not many people would want to confront people especially if there is more than one person or of the thought of creating bad karma around the neighbourhood. Therefore my top tip would be to anonymously call the non-emergency police, if it persists, call them again and again until you have a patrol officer. That is just my opinion, however if you do require a life hack, good luck!
How can I work out my girlfriend's ring size, without asking her or using a ring?
This is a refinement of the 'compare your fingers' idea, but is considerably more accurate and only requires a photograph:Find a high-resolution photograph of the two of you where both hands are visible and in close proximity (to ensure there is no foreshortening due to perspective effects).Crop the photograph to the portion containing your fingers. Enlarge and print onto paper.Measure (using a ruler) the image diameter of your finger on the photograph (call it a1) and the same measurement of your partner's finger (call it a2). These will depend on how zoomed-in the photograph is.Determine the actual diameter (d1) of your own finger by discovering your own ring-size and using a conversion table such as http://www.onlineconversion.com/ring_size.htm.Calculate the actual diameter d2 of your partner's finger by the formula d2 = a2 * (d1 / a1).Convert this into your partner's ring-size by the same conversion table used in step 4.The result should be accurate to within a fraction of a millimetre (so you'll be able to determine exactly which US ring-size is closest to your partner's).EDIT: I actually tried this out shortly after posting the answer. In particular, I designed a ring and had it rendered in platinum. The following image is proof that, at least on this occasion, the method indeed worked as intended:This was eight months ago, and my girlfriend and I have been together ever since...
How to light a match?
Any match will flare when it gets hot enough, and with friction you can get even "safety" matches to flare. The trick is to find a hard surface with just the right degree of roughness: too smooth and you can't get enough friction, too rough and you scrape the match head material off. Often a mug, bowl or other piece of pottery will have an unglazed portion on the bottom that works. However this is very hit or miss; some don't seem to work at all. With a relatively good piece I have about a 50% success rate per match. Save the rejects, they'll still have enough head left to catch and extend your flame when you do get one lit.

How to work with a CD/DVD whose data sectors are bad?
If the CD is badly scratched then sorry, some things lived enough. They are not repairable. Just in case wash the CD with water, wipe it dry, and then insert the CD and play again. 
How to work with a CD/DVD whose data sectors are bad?
CDs usually get damaged because of scratches at their plastic surface.Dirty solution: Wipe the surface of the CD with an oily tissue.By going in the scratches, the oil will flatten again the CD surface, thus reducing the scattering of the laser beam by the damaged surface. I have tried once with vegetable oil, and I was able to recover a CD with small scratches. Ideally the oil should have the same refractive index as the CD, which is 1.59 for polycarbonate. Also make sure not to put too much oil: The disk spins quite fast, and you don't want to spread oil inside the CD player.Clean solution: Buy a product to clean the CD.I have already seen in a specialized shop a cleaning product presented as a bottle with a sponge on the head. The principle is the same as above, except that the liquid to spread is not oil, but some sort of plastic dissolved in a solvent. Once deposited on the CD, it dries. This results in a more permanent solution to your problem.In any case, the repairs are not perfect, and I strongly suggest you to make a copy of the CD after treatment.
How to work with a CD/DVD whose data sectors are bad?
(Below is for scratches, obviously try soapy water first if it's just a smudge)Head over to amazon or the like and search for "DVD polisher". These devices use fine grit polishing paper to polish scratched plastic on a DVD or cd. The plastic layer is thicker than needed for ease of handling (although if you manage to polish a while lot away the optical focusing properties of the plastic will go away so don't go more that you have to). You could probably improvise something similar with wet polish and fine abrasive if you happen to have some (eg for acrylic polishing on an airplane) but the kits look to be $15-$17 and they really do work. The "SkipDr" looks like the one that lives in IT departments everywhere for software cd recovery.

Remove and prevent mildew from wallpaper
Once we can see mildew it unfortunately is too late to take precautions such as regular ventilating, heating, dehumidifying using an air conditioner (if available).The fungal organisms and their spores will dwell deep within your wallpaper and possibly even underneath it. Superficially removing them, or treating them with chemicals will only lead to a very temporal relief. They will come back sooner or later.We therefore have to completely remove all of the affected wallpaper. We may also have to remove the plastering, if affected. We will only find out after the wallpaper was removed.Before we decorate the wall again we need to make sure all moisture is gone. This needs heating of the room and it needs frequent ventilation. To speed up the drying process there are special dehumidifying devices for rent (note that power consumption will be more expensive than the rental fees). We then may treat the underground with a special anti-mildew preparation for disinfection before we mount our new wallpaper.
How can I untangle a very fine jewellery chain?

There are a couple reasons why your CD is damaged.The most common one is scratches. If the surface is scuffed and scratched, the easiest fix is to buff it with a cutting compound. Start with baking soda and water and use a cloth wrapped around a wooden block to keep it flat. Rub down the surface of the CD with only the weight of the block providing the pressure. Keep the surface wet. Rinse off the first layer under running water. The surface should appear even and dull all over (not shiny)Next you need to polish the surface. Use some toothpaste and a clean sponge. This polishing will get rid of the dull surface finish caused by the roughing step we did with the baking soda. When you rinse the water off this time, it should have a mirror like surface.Another common way to damage a CD is to damage the silver backing of the disc. If this happens, that bit of information is permanently gone. Nothing you can do to get that back.The third that I can think of is due to incompatibility of the CD case. The gases being released by the plastic of the CD case can cause the plastic of the CD to break down prematurely. The only way I've managed to recover one of these was a method listed above, where a light oil is used to fill the pits on the surface of the disc. Even then, you may not get all your data back. 
How to clean a mattress?
Alcohol solutions are used for removal of living tissue and oils. The ideal blend is 70% alcohol to 30% water. The alcohol damages the cell wall, and the water causes the living cell to rupture.The best solution is prevention, or a sacrificial top to the mattress. A separate layer of high density foam at the top of the mattress is ideal. This can be aired out every so often and the cover laundered. 
Remove dust bubble from glass screen protector?
If you have an extremely sharp knife, you can sometimes make a small incision and then use a credit card or something similar to push all the air out via this incision, which then disappears due to the small size.The knife must be really sharp as to make as small hole as possible with as little tearing as possible.
Remove and prevent mildew from wallpaper
Use a sharp knife to scrape off any visible mildrew.Then mix vinegar/water solution 1:1 and spray on the wall, or use something such as a strong bleach. This will bleach the wallpaper but it's already too late to save it anyway.
How to clean a mattress?
If you have a steam cleaner (for cleaning bathrooms/ovens etc) they are ideal for also cleaning a mattress as long as you can air it out afterwards to allow it to dry.Simply move it over the surface of the mattress, the steam will kill any organics within the mattress and the water will cause dirt to wash away/lift out.Once done, the best way to dry it is to leave it outside in the sunshine. The UV rays are also antibacteria.
How can I untangle a very fine jewellery chain?
In the past I've used a knife with a sharp point to help 'pick' away at a knotted necklace of my wife's. It admittedly took a few evenings but I've untangled chains that normally she would just have thrown away.
How to deal with neighbors/street cars playing loud music?
My experience has been with a church, which refused to keep things quiet during revivals. So depending on whom your dealing with use this with caution as you can start more issues than just dealing with the noise. Also first thing is to always try and talk to the person(s) calmly and choose your words carefully. Mentioning sleeping kids can also help. The police can be helpful infrequently, more so the poorer the neighborhood you live in. And also some people/groups are going to get preferential treatment over others from the police.(Yes, from experience) On multiple occasions police in my old neighborhood refused to enforce local ordinances, and other laws being broken by the church I lived next to.However, if everything else has failed, be a prick. Find the Panic button on your car, press it and wait. Within 10 minutes the revival group I had been dealing with started packing things up and continued to do so about an hour early every day. When they had been playing until 8PM in a residential neighborhood they started packing things up by 7 as I had already politely asked them to do, but to which they initially refused.
How to deal with neighbors/street cars playing loud music?
Normally a local authority of some form can do something, contact your council, or whatever government authority you have around there. In the meantime earplugs can work, or wearing headphones/earphones and listening to something else.You don't describe the specific situation in detail (is this at night, in the day?, when you're trying to sleep?) so it's hard to give any more specific advice.
How can I untangle a very fine jewellery chain?
I found that a large amount of dish soap to help the knot slip and slide and two sets of tweezers to allow one to grip individual links of delicate chains works well. Also a magnifying light that allows you to see exactly which links of the chain are connected to which can be really helpful too. 
Reduce blender noise
I think the fundamental way of reducing your blender noise is to compare different blenders and select the one with lower noise. The noise will be mainly from the motor used by the blender, and that probably can't be reduced by you. However if part of the noise is from the blending vibrating on a hard surface, then you might be able to reduce the noise by placing a piece (or a couple layers) of felt fabric or something soft but steady as a cushion to absorb some vibration noise. 
Reduce blender noise
They actually make blender sound enclosures which will dampen a blender's noise considerably. These are generally designed for retail applications (i.e. expensive), but you can draw on the basic design for inspiration.In a previous living arrangement, I actually built an MDF box/cabinet to cover and store luggable appliances along the back of the counter top. The long cabinet that opened at the front was primarily intended to avoid having to lug out the heavier appliances, but closing the cabinet doors cut the noise dramatically. You can build a blender-sized version for your purposes (or an old speaker enclosure is ideal for this application).                 Put your blender on a rubber or vinyl mat to keep it from turning your counter top into a large sound diaphragm. You can deaden the noise further by adding acoustic insulation to the cabinet; but honestly, MDF has some pretty substantial sound-deadening properties, so I don't think the additional cost (and kitchen/cleaning unfriendliness) is worth it.

Alternatives to 'shoe tree'
Time for some CLAY.Take some easy-mold clay, such as play-doh and put it inside a plastic cover, probably the cover of a sock. Stuff it into the shoe and press firmly. The clay should take the shape of the shoe, as if it were a foot within the shoe. After you are sure that the clay has taken up all the space in the shoe tip, pull it out carefully. Do not let the clay within the plastic cover change its shape. The Plastic cover will ensure that the clay wouldn't stick to the inside of the shoe. Now, we need the clay to retain the shape of the foot. For that you need to dry the clay, for which you could use so many methods such as sun drying or freezing it. Just ensure it doesn't become brittle and crumble-able. After it is dried, you could use it as a shoe tree. Optionally, you could remove the plastic cover, but be very careful if you decide to do so. You do not want your effort to be in vain by being too careless. You could use scented clay to give it a little fragrance too. That way you could avoid unwanted odor. You could add some fragrance to enhance the smell of the stored shoe also. Make sure it doesn't react with the clay mold.
How to work with a CD/DVD whose data sectors are bad?

How to hold together large packet of paper
Spiral or coil bindings come in many different sizes:The colors can be used to distinguish, say different roles for play scripts. Spiral-bound books lie flat easily, but multiple ones don't fit well in a bookcase, since the binding is thicker than the paper. If this is a problem, think about other ways of binding.The necessary machines to actually punch the holes into the paper and insert it in the binding are available in your friendly office supplies shop:

First, cut the button off the string, making sure the string stays in position as it is now.Next, have a 2nd person compress the cushion as far as practicable and hold it in this position.  Re-tie the button to the strings as close to the cushion as desired (possible?), leaving the excess thread hanging.  Cut off the excess, leaving enough to ensure that the knot will not untie itself, and release the pressure on the cushion.

Get some rare earth magnets. Depending on the magnet field strength, you can bind large amounts of paper together. I have used them multiple times to keep things together that I didn't want punctured.Some downsides to using this method: the magnets want to stick to each other more than through the paper, so stacking bound documents would be almost impossible; they are expensive; magnets that are strong enough can cause damage to magnetic media (think computer hard drive); magnets can snap together when close, possibly causing injury in the process; extremely strong magnets are difficult to separate.

Fastest way to untangle headphones
PreventionThe over/under cable coiling method works reasonably well. But you can't prevent tangling completely without rolling the cable onto a drum. WhyIt's simple maths: there's only one untangled configuration for a cable, and even for short lengths, lots of ways to tangle it. That makes it very likely the cable will end up in a tangled configuration over time. UntanglingGrab the cable approximately in the middle. The place where the cable splits into two is a good place to start. Drop the ends.Gently untangle the remaining tangles, by feeding the loose end back through any loops it's in. 
How to reduce the noise from my household washing machine
If the tenant below is complaining, I would imagine the washing machine is perhaps shaking on a hard floor. The best way to reduce the sound of these humanoid washing machines is to place something underneath to dampen the vibrations and the sound. I suggest you use a piece of thick carpet/rug you don't care for or a rubber mat, or anything you can find that's well padded and lifts the washing machine from the floor.It is also a god idea to ensure you have left a gap between worktops etc.
What is the best way to use a tower fan and an oil heater to heat a room quickly?
We use a box fan behind the electric "finned radiator" type heaters.  Run at low, it makes for a fairly quick heat-up.Of course, where we live electric heat isn't real economical, but if you have no other choice, this works pretty well for us in the Midwest US.
How can I prevent pee from flying off-target?
For a standard man and a standard toilet, it is hardly impossible to urinate "cleanly" 99.5% of the time.Take enough to time make sure your penis is unencumbered (stretched out straight, not fouled by clothing, hairs, etc.)Then practice until you can shoot straight.  Aim with your hand, as if using a water hose.Aim for the water in the toilet.  If necessary, as the stream pressure changes, move your hips (and therefore your penis) closer to the target, in a straight line.Basic boy lessons from childhood ;-)
How to reduce the noise from my household washing machine
It sounds as though your washing machine needs to be balanced properly.If you've never done it, it can be a bit of a black art. The machine will normally have 2 feet at the front which can be unscrewed with a spanner to make them longer (or vice versa) to make sure the machine is sitting firmly on all four feet. If one of the feet is too short, it's a bit like a chair sitting on an uneven floor (or a restaurant table) where it keeps wobbling on the 2 longest legs and onto each of the other 2 legs in turn.I usually find it much easier to balance it by sliding thin material like plywood, cardboard or plastic under the suspect foot until it gets better. Do it while the machine is spinning to get instant feedback. Once you establish which foot needs to be longer, you can then make the fix permanent by adjusting the foot with a spanner.

The longer it is the more accurate it will be.
How to memorize tons of names?
Remembering names/nouns by the quantity isn't effective, you're mind needs to attach those to the person and once you recognise someone, their name will be floating around somewhere (if you have already been told what it is) be it either side of the iceberg. Therefore the only solution would be a 'mind hack'. You could however post the first part of your question on the English Language & Usage exchange to perhaps come up with a solution to alternatives of avoiding the mentioning of their name to avoid embarrassment. What I tend to do is be straight with the person and admit I do not remember their name, most people aren't actually offended by this.Note: I would have posted this as a comment if it wern't for the limitations to the number of characters.

How to prevent keys/keyrings from snagging on clothes
This is probably going to look like an ad but it isn't I'm just going to let you know about a product that I bought recently and it helped me with my key problems and yours was one of them, it's called keysmart It basically helps you organize your keys. So far I'm loving it, it's sturdy and good quality material(hopefully it lasts long) as of now I have no complaints about it. So no more keyrings poking through my slacks, and I gotta admit it makes key organization much more easier, I bought it for around 20 USD which at first seemed a bit over the top for a key organizer, but I can tell you that the investment is paying off. 
How to prevent keys/keyrings from snagging on clothes
Use a thicker, better quality ring to replace the smaller ring. The wire type key ring holder is meant for quick attachment of keys to a tag, not long term use in a pocket. You can find an assorted set of sizes in a package at almost any hardware store.
How to prevent keys/keyrings from snagging on clothes
You can use a keychain with a snap hook to put it on your belt loops, and let the keys hang outside or put them half in your pockets.Although this solution will not keep the keys together all the time, it will let the keys hang, and therefore not be in the bottom of your pockets where they harm most (according to my experience).
How can I work out my girlfriend's ring size, without asking her or using a ring?
If it was for a random gift, I would get some toy rings for each of us, like Mood rings, and have fun. Both of us would have one, and it would be a goofy time. And then, I'd know how she adjusted it for her fingers. If it was for an engagement ring... I wouldn't propose to anyone that I hadn't previously discussed marriage with, including the cost of the rings, the metal and design, and the size.

What is the best way to use a tower fan and an oil heater to heat a room quickly?
It takes a long time to heat your room because the heat from the static heater moves to the ceiling so that you don't feel it at the beginning. As you wait, there is more air being heated, and the height above which there is hot air becomes smaller.Therefore, I do not totally agree with Hobbes' answer. Here is what I would do:Place the heater in the middle of the room.Place the fan such that it blows air on the heater. Set it to maximum.The maximum setting won't add more heat in the room (except from the fan's motor, but that is negligible). However, it will create turbulent mixing of the air. Therefore, instead of having hot air at the ceiling of your room and still cold air at your height, you would obtain air at a medium temperature, fairly uniform in the whole room.Perhaps putting the fan such that it blows from the bottom to the top of the room (or reverse) would be another option to prevent the formation of cold and hot air layers.
How to stop shoes from squeaking on hard floors?
The soles of some shoes are covered with a thin layer of black paint to make them look shiny and new. That's what is making your shoes squeak. You have two options, wear the shoes until this layer is worn off or get some sandpaper and get scrubbing. It's only a thin layer and you will see it peeling off as you sand them, so don't go nuts. Once this layer is gone, no more squeak! You'll have better grip on wet floors too.
Alternatives to 'shoe tree'
You can use plaster to cast a shape like the inside form of the shoe. Mix plaster and water in a container like old plastic box (I use old bottles of water and cut the top)Fill the mixture in a condom and tie it.

There is a large variety of sponges and you can choose s suitable size to put inside your shoes. And they are very cheep and you can change them often if you wish.

How do I safely clean a laptop using scuba gear?
I just cleaned my wireless keyboard with the leftover air in my scuba tank. I opened the valve (on the tank), held the keyboard directly in front of the airstream, and blasted away. I started at a low pressure and then gradually opened the valve until the air was coming out fast enough to depress the keys. It worked great, a lot of dust came out, and the air was free because the tank was done and I was going to take it back to the shop for a refill anyway.I recommend using a spent tank (not a fresh tank that you plan to dive with) and starting out at a low pressure. To be on the safe side, you may want to lay a cushion on the ground in case you accidentally drop your keyboard. I was more worried about getting crumbs in the house, so I did it halfway outside in the doorway.Hope this helps.

How do I make my room or even an apartment warmer/cozier?
Let the sun in during the day, without opening windows. You need as much sun light as possible. Clean the windows, remove the curtains and blinds. The sun will warm the floor and walls and they will stay warmer during the evening.You also have to reduce loss of heat. During the night close your windows and doors tightly. If there are gaps - use isolation band for doors and windows. Put thick curtains on the windows after sunset.You can try to paint the outside wall in black, but it wont be cheaper than buying a simple electric heater and you will have the opposite problem during the summer.
How to only make one trip when carrying groceries
Use a folding shopping cart, which you can keep in the trunk/back or behind a seat. You could combine it with the carabiners that @DrMoishe Pippik mentioned above, so you can hang bags (or other things with handles) off the side, and in the front, if the cart can't carry anything.If you have stairs to go up, get one that can climb stairs. They have three wheels in a triangular formation on each side. And if you get tired because you are moving four or five loads of groceries all at once, get one with a seat so you can sit and take a break. :D

How to prevent the washing machine from mold
Removing the mold First of all, check that you're washing machine is bleach tolerable. If it is then run an ordinary empty cycle with hot water and add around 1/2 cup of bleach, bleach is the most effective substance for removing those nasty spores. If your machine is not bleach tolerable then use a considerable amount of vinegar, just be sure to run a quick cycle afterwards to get rid of the smell. You may opt to simply scrub the seal manually with some bleach but running a cycle with some nice hot water will most definitely have a stronger chance of fighting the mold. Next dab a diluted mixture of bleach into the remaining areas that the mold may be roaming and leave for 10 minutes before wiping down.  PreventionDon't always wash on low temperaturesTry to use detergents that contain bleachOnce you're clear of the mold, once a month put an empty boil wash on with some bleach/bleached detergent The smell is a common result of the mold developed inside washing machines, once the spores have been eradicated then this will no longer be a problem. If there is still an odor omitting from your washing machine in the coming weeks then the spores may have spread deeper and it may be a good idea to remove the seal and scrub underneath.Good luck!

Improvised dice tray
Get a microwave cooking tray (the hard melamine variety) with a clear cover.  These generally have a flat bottom on the interior and are sometimes found at no extra charge in microwave frozen meals -- enjoy the food, and then wash the tray and cover carefully.  To manage clatter and improve the roll of the dice, you can glue a piece of felt or foam rubber sheet (sold in craft stores) into the inside.  Rubber cement is a good glue for this; it'll stick equally well to felt, foam sheet, and melamine, and you can peel the lining out later if needed for cleaning.When ready to throw, put the dice into the tray, put the lid on it, and shake the entire tray, then put it down on the table while the dice are still moving.  If you prefer, you can glue foam sheet on the outside of the bottom as an anti-skid pad and throw the dice into the tray with the lid off.  Either way, if you've chosen a tray with steep sides, the dice should land on the internal felt or foam surface without cocking or over-rolling, and be easily read through the clear plastic cover.
How can I keep 2 blankets together on a bed?
Pin them together with safety pins. There isn't really much more to be said, but by laying them out how you like them, you can then pin them together at the corners and they won't be able to separate because they will be physically held together.
Improvised dice tray
There are a lot of things you could use.For example, a cardboard shoe box is about the right size. So would a cereal box laid on its side.  To soften the sound of the dice rolling, get an old dish towel, cut it down to a rectangle the same size as the base of the box, and staple / tape / glue it in. You can also cut the sides of the box down to a lower height.Another option that might be noisier is a 9" circular cake pane.  (I just found one online for $4.00.) Again, you can cut an old dish towel to a 9" diameter circle and use double-sided tape to stick it in the bottom of the pan and quiet the rolling dice.
How can I keep 2 blankets together on a bed?
To keep the two blankets together you can purchase blanket cover in which both blankets fit together. Else you can purchase cloth and get the cover stitched.

How can I keep 2 blankets together on a bed?
When I was in the Marines (what seems like forever and a day ago) I used to hook bungee cords at both bottom corners (which were folded in the hospital corner method) connecting under the mattress pulling the sheets and blankets tight and  one on only one side of top corners under the mattress. So three corners were completely secure and tight so all I had to worry about in the morning was flipping the one unsecured corner down. This does take a little getting used to though sometimes it would feel too tight, but they always stayed in place.

How do I make my room or even an apartment warmer/cozier?
The furnace in my house went out in the dead of winter last year (I live in Cincinnati, Oh - so it gets a little cold in the winter) I still haven’t bothered getting it fixed even though this winter. All I did was bought a few little space heaters online (the best ones are the radiator style electric oil heaters they crank out some serious heat), some plastic sheeting that has adhesive strips to put over the windows and vents, some semi thin foam strips with adhesive to put on the inner sides of the door jams, and keep any doors closed to unused rooms putting blankets under the door to cut down on the draft. This all may be slightly excessive for you, but maybe some of the ideas could improve the temp for you.
Improvised dice tray
Choose a lid of a shoe boxed or similar - you can get free ones from kid's shoes at stores, if you need a smaller version. Bonus: If you use a lid of a box you already use, you can just put it back after your game. Cardboard is "soft" enough that the dice shouldn't clatter too much, making lining the lid optional.Or raid your kitchen: A low lunch box or other plastic box should be roomy enough that the dice can roll, yet small enough to fit on a table.Any kind of soft fabric or foam should reduce clatter. Find an old towel / rag to cut up to size, just remember that the fabric should be free from folds and have an even surface, otherwise your other players might claim that this influences the dice too much.

These are open rings that you bend the bands closer or further apart to make fit. If you can get her to wear one of these, you can know the size of her finger after she takes it off.
How to open a frozen car door?
Electric blanket with another one over it. Wait a bit. Place over the frozen door. Plug in to a safe outlet
How to open a frozen car door?
If the lock freezes shut, the easiest way to thaw it is to heat the key with a lighter and use the hot key to melt the ice inside the lock.  Following up with a shot of spray windshield deicer (which is usually methanol, sometimes mixed with a little ether) will prevent immediate refreezing.  A little water displacing light oil, similar to WD-40, will then displace the water from the lock for a longer term solution.In your case, however, you were able to operate the lock and latch, but the gasket was frozen to the car's frame.  I've encountered this in ice storm conditions in the past, and was able to break the interfering ice by throwing my shoulder against the door (as if trying to push it in) until the ice between door and frame had cracked enough to pull the door open.  This works better in older cars that have a little "give" in the door, but all should allow compressing the gasket slightly, and ice is brittle enough it won't take much.  There is a slight risk of denting the sheet metal of the door, so this is best done on either the window frame (a likely location for the ice, anyway) if present, or the trailing edge of the door, where the latch is.  If you have deicer or windshield washer fluid (rated below the ambient temperature) available, either can be applied into the crack between door and frame to help the process by weakening the ice.Keeping a jug of the coldest-rated washer fluid at work is a good precaution; it will also be very helpful in getting the ice layer off the windshield in less than a half hour of warming the engine and scraping.
How to prevent the washing machine from mold
Sodium bicarbonate and apple cider vinegar are excellent fabric softeners. It is not only that they break the mineral deposits on the clothes, they also have an  antimicrobial effect.It has been some seasons that I've replaced the rubber band. I make sure to collect the water that remains lodged whenever I notice it, but I can't sense any odor. It also used to be the case that loads which I've forgotten in the machine for a few hours would already have a noticeable odor as I hang the damp clothes, but I haven't noticed that either for quite some time.
Wallet won't close because there's too much money in it
If you were to put cash in your wallet like in the picture you've provided, the thickness of cash in the fold of the wallet makes it difficult to close. Alternatively you could invest in a money clip these hold you cash tightly together, when folded in half you can fit a wad in either side of the wallet compartment. You could also use a paperclip, but if you have too much money in your wallet I'd buy a money clip :-)
Wallet won't close because there's too much money in it
This should not be a common situation,  as you really should only have a little more than enough money in your wallet for what you are going to need for the day. In other words, most of that money  should not be in there in the first place. If you need to carry extra money one day, I would seriously consider alternate ways of carrying it for safety reasons and the following springs to mind:A money belt – Store the extra money around your waist in a belt, or dedicated  pouch for carrying money A neck wallet – When travelling some people use a wallet/bag to keep their passport and extra money safe. You hang this under your clothes around your neckIn your socks – Another option could be to store some of the extra money tucked into your socks parallell to your legs (if your socks are long enough to keep them properly fastened) 
Wallet won't close because there's too much money in it
As a former taxi driver, I used to have to carry a day's cash intake on my person, at least long enough to take it to the bank and deposit most of it.  I routinely found it more than I could close inside my wallet, especially after I switched to a tri-fold type.My solution was to carry my cab fares and the day's starting wad (enough to change a $50 for a $5 fare, at least) in my shirt pocket (button-up collared shirt), inside a vest.  As I accumulated cash through the day, I'd transfer $20 and $50 bills from the shirt pocket to the inside vest pocket -- still accessible, but like the "drop" safe in a convenience store, somewhat protected in the event of a robbery (I was never robbed in two years driving, but it was always a possibility to consider), and hiding the bulk of the day's income even while making change.
How to only make one trip when carrying groceries
Get a cardboard box from the super market. Most supermarkets I've found will happily give you a banana box or similar cardboard box for free. (Ask the person stocking the produce section). You can then fit several shopping bags worth of groceries in the one banana box, so long as you are strong enough to carry it. 
How can I scratch lottery tickets?
Most of the time I used any parts of the ball pen like the bottom part of it. If you are lucky to have the cap of the ball pen it can effectively scratch your lottery ticket.I suggest the pen because it is always available in almost every places, you can borrow one if you can't find any.
How can I keep the top floor of my house cool?
Hot air will always rise, so either you need to stop the hot air from entering the lower floor (aka stop ventilating lower floor, which would require some other option to cool the first level), or you need to provide a way for the rising hot air to escape.My suggestion would be to shut down/close off most of the rooms in the second floor using curtains and closed doors, but still provide a way for the hot air from below to escape. Possibly using the balcony, or one of the rooms as a vent.If your entire second floor is closed off just like a hat, you'll only gather the heat all the time. The hotter air from below needs to escape somewhere.
How can I keep the top floor of my house cool?
For a somewhat more long time solution, consider planting trees on the side of the house that faces the sun during the hottest part of the day.  The trees will block a lot of the sunlight from hitting your house (once they are big enough). 
How can I keep the top floor of my house cool?
If it is possible to stop or greatly reduce the airflow between the two floors, then the problem reduces to keeping the sun from heating up the second floor.  If you get some exterior (roller) window shutters for your top floor and keep them closed during the day to block the sun, that might help to keep it cooler upstairs.  In the evening and night you can open the shutters and windows to let in fresh air.
Wallet won't close because there's too much money in it
How about a large non-folding wallet? You could keep it your inside coat pocket, or wear cargo pants or shorts with a large pocket on the leg that this bigger wallet fits into.
How do I make my room or even an apartment warmer/cozier?
In houses I lived in, Windows were often the weak spot of the heat insulation where heat is lost at night. Make sure the window and frame tighten correctly and you don't get wind through. You can buy rolls of rubber in case it isn't shutting tight e.g. on ebay. Alternatively and additionally, close the roller shutter do reduce wind blowing past the window and carrying heat away or pressing through remaining gaps (haven't wrapped my mind about how much of infrared radiation gets kept in the flat by closing the roller shutter).On the inside of the window, close the curtains at night to reduce air circulation past the window (you may notice weak cold wind next to your window). (Again, if you don't have roller shutters, the curtains should lock infrared raddiation in, no idea how relevant this actually is)Hack yourself. Ginger makes you warmer. I didn't investigate if it only makes you feel warmer or actually raises the body temperature (there are many people on the internet claiming it would increase your metabolism). My guts feeling is it feels 1-2°C warmer when you had a ginger tea on top of having had a warm drink. In Nepal in mountain huts they freshly rasp 1-2 teaspoons of ginger into the tea, I usually slice 1cm to 1 finger thick ginger into ~1mm thick slices (as thin as possible while still easy to cut), and put them in a cup of boiling water. If you don't like the taste, maybe add a bag of any kind of tea/infusion. In the office I don't want to worry about storing fresh ginger and have a caster of dried ground ginger which I put in a cup of infusion. It's a bit annoying to have the powder in the infusion when drinking though.NB: I've been told that various kinds of drinks/fruits have the opposite of the desired effect (making you feel colder), so combining the ginger with those in the infusion might be a bad idea. Blamed were anything with caffein and citrus fruit, I didn't test that.
How to clean my ear canal with something more reusable than a cotton swab?
I was looking for the same type of thing as you and found this on Amazon
How to keep planted seeds watered permanently?
There are several ways to do this:Water globes:These are containers of water with a narrow opening that you fill and stick into the soil. Commercial ones can be very attractive, and advertise as keeping your plants watered "for weeks". I've never used them myself, but I have repeatedly heard that they are unlikely to keep your plant watered more than a single week, and require regular cleaning. They generally run from $9 to $20. You can also create your own with a bottle with a small hole; I suspect a large bottle with a pinprick hole may last longer, but I've never tried it.Drip watering systems:Some of them have tanks and some work from faucets; most have an adjustable drip. They are more likely to last more than a week. The ones that use faucets seem to primarily be designed for outdoor use, so may be useful once the plants are transitioned outdoors, and many of these are designed for multiple pots. There are also drip hoses, but they are not really designed for what you seem to be doing. A quick google search found systems that ranged from about $19 to $99. A wick system:This uses a wick (a thread, strip of fabric, yarn, shoelace, or something similar) to wick water from a separate container of water to the soil of the planter, either at the top or the bottom of the pot. There are a couple of commercial products according to Google, but this is generally a do-it-yourself method. You will need some time to be sure your plant is getting the correct amount of water, and make adjustments as needed (usually by changing to a thicker or thinner wick). As a do-it-yourself, this will generally not run more than a couple of dollars, and may be effectively free if you already have what you need. (One word of warning: if you have a wick at the bottom of the pot and you run out of water in the container, the wick will pull water out of the pot. Putting a wick at the bottom of the pot that isn't connected to water is actually a suggested method to keep pots from waterlogging or for plants that need very good drainage.)The visual system:This involves keeping the plant somewhere that is both close to water and somewhere you will see it frequently. Next to or behind the sink works well for me; I can see when the plant looks like it needs water, and I don't have to stop what I'm doing to get water for it. It does require a plant that can survive drying out to the point where the need for water is visible on a regular basis. A moisture detector of some sort can help with this whether it's an actual meter of some sort or a terra cotta 'worm' that changes color as the soil moisture changes. It's free, or the cost of whatever you use to track soil moisture, but your results may vary.
Remove ants from honey
Warm the honey to make it less viscous (you may even need to add a little water), then pour through a fine strainer or cheesecloth. 
How to keep planted seeds watered permanently?
The LifeHack way is to use a filled plastic bottle with a small hole drilled in the bottle cap, put upside down in the soil. This way you only need to refill the water once every week or so, depending on the size of the bottle.See Google for examples.Good luck!
How to keep planted seeds watered permanently?
I LOVE answering gardening questions! Here's my idea. Use a styrofoam board as an insert (you will have to cut portions out accordingly) to place the seed starter cell pots on. Get it just right, and you can have the whole thing float like a raft in a pan of water! The styrofoam will keep the cell pots from sinking, but lie low enough that the roots can easily access the moisture they need. You can also buy trays like this, but it's more fun to make your own!    
Remove ants from honey
How to remove these ants and consume honey?I'll answer the first part first. If there are only a few (less than a dozen or so), in the jar, you can use a long, pointy object, like a chopstick, and push the ants one by one to the edge and work them to the surface, where they can be picked out. If your honey has so many ants in it that you cannot easily remove them all, consider giving up on that bit. In the summer you could put it outside and let bees take it back.To consume honey, place small amount in mouth, mix with saliva, and swallow. (just kidding xD) 
Bed frame not stable
Place the bed firmly against the wall and place anything heavy like a a set of drawers to the foot end of the bed.If you are able to buy a cheap hammer and some nails, get some very long ones and hammer them in around the joints.I'm assuming you mean wooden dowels are being used, reinforce them by pulling them out of the holes, stuffing newspaper in the hole and use super glue (if you have any) to bind the dowels into the holes.Using 4 pieces of rope, tie the bottom of the left legs, from the head to the foot end to each other..very tightly, do the same for the right. If you have one of the wooden beds where the headboard has vertical slats, tie another piece of rope from each corner of the headboard, tuck down to the legs of the head end, run along the base and tie to the foot end.Hope that makes sense. Any questions let me know and Good Luck! :-)
Securing a large board on the roof of my car
I wouldn't recommend using tape, you're safest bet is to use a ratchet strap if you can get hold of one. You'll be able to secure the boards down and feed the strap through the doors, through experience this doesn't cause any issues with closing the doors and won't get in the way.Reference: eBay Listing
Securing a large board on the roof of my car
Best thing is DON'T.  There are "fail" memes all over the internet from people trying to do this.  It's neither safe nor effective.  You should be able to get the piece delivered to your home at a reasonable surcharge -- which will certainly  be less than the fine and liability you'll pay if the board comes off in traffic and damages someone else's property, or the repair bill when (not really if) you damage your own car.If you can't get the board delivered, see if you know someone who has a large enough vehicle to carry it safely, either fully enclosed in a van body or at least tied down securely in a pickup truck bed.
Remove ants from honey
Slowly sink a drinking straw into the honey, aiming for an ant.  The ant should be smaller than the straw and should wind up inside of it. Plug the open end (at the top) with your thumb, and quickly lift the straw out of the honey.  You can then blow on the clean open end to eject the honey-plus-ant into the trash or sink. Repeat for each ant.
Securing a large board on the roof of my car
Open the doors and loop the tape around through the doors, then close the doors on the tape.  That will allow the doors to open.  (Twine is another option, if you don't want duct tape adhesive on a lot of your car.)Be aware of driving SLOWLY. A board like that, on your roof, can easily catch some wind and lift up.
How do I dry out the inside of my car?
Could you use the car's heating system? Leave the car running with heating on full blast and vents pointed as much as possible towards the wet area. Providing it's not raining you would want to have the windows slightly open to let damp air out. AddendumThere are some vacuum cleaners that can suck up water (safely). If you have one of these or have a friend with one, that would help to get out water deep in the foam.
How do I dry out the inside of my car?
The most energy-efficient way is to wait for the next warm day, crack the windows open a bit and watch the weather this time. If you don't want to wait: Leave the car running with the heater at high temperature, the air conditioning on and the heating set to recirculation. The combination will lower the air humidity and simultaneously increase the amount of humidity the air can hold, so it will draw all the moisture out of the car.  This works if the AC controller is dumb enough to allow it. On cars with automatic climate control, the AC tends to switch off when you switch the heater on, so you have to select a very low temperature instead. 
How do I dry out the inside of my car?
Soak up as much moisture as you can with a towel. Aim a car fan at the seat on a hot temperature and leave a widow partially open to release the evaporated moisture. Hot air is the best way to dry out fabric, I use a hair dryer and it takes no longer than a minute for fabric to dry (depending on the surface area of course). If they're leather seats, a simple wipe over with a towel and left to stand for a few minutes will do the trick.For future reference, keep a towel in the car so that you are prepared for future occurrences. Leave the towel on the seat when your not at the car, if you forget and don't want to spend time drying, you could always sit the towel on the damp patch later to make the ride more comfortable.Hope this helps.
How do I dry out the inside of my car?
If applicable, you should pick a sunny day, and open all the windows and doors of your car, let your car sit in the sun for as long as possible. This way, you can prevent any bad smell from not dying up everything quickly enough. 
How do I dry out the inside of my car?
After your initial pat down with a towel, leave a marine or RV desiccant bucket in your car. They're typically used for winterizing boats and RVs to prevent mold developing from humidity issues. You'll want one with a mesh or screen top so if it tips over while you are driving it won't spill the desiccant material. It will trap moisture and won't release it back into the air.  Something like this: 
How do I dry out the inside of my car?
If there is a lot of water, especially if it is standing water, use a wet/dry shop vacuum to remove it. This can also help  help dry out the seats as well, as it causes air flow which well help evaporate the moisture. 
Smartphone data usage when travelling in US
You will probably find it easier and less expensive to purchase a local prepaid phone for traveling to the US from overseas. Many include "unlimited" data plans. And if you are going to be in the US for more than a few days, it can save you a great deal of money.It appears that you have several choices for smartphones from the local retailers (Walmart, among so many others). As of this writing, the prices run about $100, including the phone and air time.You can forward calls from your normal phone to the prepaid, but may incur charges from your home cell phone carrier. Check with them.
How do I dry out the inside of my car?
If your car's heat and A/C both work, it has everything it needs to dry itself better than anything we could come up with.When you switch on your car's front "defroster" / "defogger" (the little windshield symbol), you are essentially running the heat and A/C at the same time -- the two basic components that make up a commercial dehumidifier. You've probably seen that puddle that forms beneath running cars on a hot day. That's condensation from the A/C. That water came from the air inside the car -- human breath, sweat, air leaked in from outside. As air blows across the cooling coils, water condenses and drains outside.However, as everyone knows, hot air is best for removing moisture from wet surfaces. A clothes dryer is a basic example.Put these two concepts together and you have a dehumidifier -- cooling coils to pull water out of air, heating coils to re-heat the air so it will absorb water again, and a fan to keep it moving.So, crank up the defogger, put the windows up, and come back in 30 minutes***. You'll be surprised how well it works. If you have an older car with the little A/C button, be sure it's on. If you can manage to get the heat coming from the main vents AND turn on the A/C button, that'll work even better.***If it needs to be said, don't run your car for long periods in an enclosed garage. Someone could die in there.
How do I prevent/fix holes in the front pockets of my jeans?
You could put your keys in a Keybone or similar device.They come in a wide range of designs and colours, and many have loops or hooks for attaching to a lanyard or keychain. 
How can I soundproof my room (or part of it) so I can sing without annoying my roommates?
One of the best materials for soundproofing is, believe it or not, eggcrate foam. It might not be your cheapest option, but it is certainly not your most expensive. Thick blankets would probably be your next best bet.The shape of your structure (if you decide to build one) isn't as important for soundproofing as it is for getting good acoustics. Just cover the walls, doors and windows and you'll at least be better off than when you started.
How can I soundproof my room (or part of it) so I can sing without annoying my roommates?
In addition to eggcrate foam, which was mentioned by Casey James Garland, be sure to address the air vents you mentioned. The most soundproof solution for those would be to completely block them with something relatively soundproof, like a pillow. Just be sure that the pillow fills the vent snugly, so there are no gaps at the corners where the sound can sneak through.However, putting a pillow in your air vent may be ill advised -- it will block the flow of warmed or cooled air (obviously), the pillow will get dusty, and removing the pillow after you sing will probably launch dust into the air and make you sneeze. If the air vent is blasting particularly hot air, there may be a fire hazard too.
How to revive dried up pens
There's one solution / it works all the time! Wet a napkin and take the ink cartridge and roll it up in the napkin/ place in mic for 20 sec ! 
How to turn off the lights without getting out of bed?
If you don't want to just turn off the light and then get in bed (as for instance you read a bit before going to sleep), just get a lamp that clamps or screws to the headboard, so that you can use that instead of the room lights.  Been doing it for decades, myself.
How to turn off the lights without getting out of bed?
Simple!  You're looking for Home Automation.  It's rather all the rage right now, as "The Internet of Things" becomes the buzzword for marketers over the next couple of years.But it's not really that new; I remember having a system in the 1970s when I lived with my folks where they had a box with several buttons on the bedside table and could turn lights and certain other appliances on or off with it.  In those days, and assuming I'm recalling it correctly, these systems worked by sending an RF signal through the home's electrical system.  Here's a photo of a device not unlike my parent's:With the advent of widespread networking protocols, cheap microprocessors, and cheap (!??!) software developers (perhaps I should say "the ubiquitous development of software" instead, because not ALL programmers are as underpaid as I am), you can now control more devices, perhaps, soon, virtually ALL devices in your home and garage, from your laptop or smartphone.Here's an example of someone who's "rolled his own" Bluetooth solution:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gam1PqXju6QBut there are plenty of commercial options available.  So, you should be able to plug your phone in to charge overnight beside your bed, hop in, press the screen a few times, and "LIGHTS OUT" ... :-)
Wallet won't close because there's too much money in it
If you want the wallet to close with that much money inside, use larger denomination bills.  The point of having larger denomination bills is that it makes it easier to store, carry, and exchange larger amounts of money.  This has its downsides (see Larry Summers's post here, for example), but one of the advantages is that it solves the specific problem raised in this question.Also consider leaving some in a safe or other such safe place where you can conveniently access it, if the banks are too inconvenient.  Carrying that much on your person concentrates your exposure to the risk of robbery.
How can I keep the top floor of my house cool?
Opening windows on the upper floor as well as the lower is the best way to get airflow in to that space.  You want to encourage air to come in through the open windows on the bottom floor, and go upstairs and out the windows on the top floor.  If you have more control and flexibility over the property, you could consider installing a cool roof to reduce summer solar heating loads, plant shade trees, and/or (as a much more energy-intensive solution) install air conditioning plus insulation.  Finally, feel free to check out the Green Building Advisor's guide to natural & alternative cooling, this LifeHacker article, or this Mother Earth article.
How do I remove hairs from a caster wheel on a roller chair?
I think my answer will come as a surprise to most people, since I did not see it online during my repair attempts.The wheels or rollers used by common office chairs are universal. They're called "casters" and you can buy a set of five on eBay for around $8, including shipping. Because the other methods can take hours, replacing them is cost effective for anyone making even minimum wage. Unfortunately, while you can remove them, there does not seem to be a simple way to disassemble the casters themselves for repair, since the most popular YouTube method for doing so involved complicated drill holes and other carpentry.I found both the knife and the conventional lighter methods to be ineffective. I did not try the Iroda torch pictured in another comment ($60). I declined to try either of the high-concentration hydrogen peroxide or drain cleaner methods proposed online. I had the idea to try a Dremel tool with a flat attachment ($80), but again that is price prohibitive if you do not already own one, and may not even work.
How can I clean stainless steel coffee maker carafe
Commercial coffee-maker cleaners contain phosphoric acid, citric acid, hydroxyacetic acid or other mild acids that dissolve scale that holds the coffee stain to the metal, so you could also use citric acid (sold as "sour salt" for cooking) or even vinegar (though it's only 5% acetic acid, so may need heat and extra time to remove stains).A commercial stainless-steel cleaner containing oxalic acid, such as Bar Keepers Friend, should also be effective. My personal experience is that the abrasive in this type of cleaner helps the acid to remove scale and stain. You could even make your own oxalic acid by extracting it from rhubarb leaves.
How can I clean stainless steel coffee maker carafe
Ice cubes. Salt. Shake/spin. Dump. Repeat if needed. Rinse when finished.I worked in a restaurant for the better half of my teens and twenties... We used to do a sanitizer soak on the glass coffee pots 2-3x a week, but on the other nights we would use ice cubes and 2-3 tablespoons of table salt and then vigorously "spin" or aggitate the glass cannisters to clean them. The salt would act as a mild abrasive, and also slowly melt away the ice cubes creating a slush wash to scrub/rinse the walls of the coffee pots. It worked like a charm on glass and im sure it may work wonders on the stainless as well.
How can I keep the top floor of my house cool?
Leave the loft hatch open. This will allow hot air to rise into the roof and bypass insulation. It's surprising how much this can reduce the temperature.
How to repair a dent on my water bottle?
Fill it with sand, salt, sugar, or some other granulated material. Use a dowel to pack it down. With enough pressure in the correct area, the dent will pop out.
How to repair a dent on my water bottle?
I don't know how tall the water bottle is but you can easily push the dent out out with the handle of a wooden spoon, its thin enough to go through the tip of the bottle yet stiff enough to apply good pressure.
How to repair a dent on my water bottle?
If your saying the bottle is extruding on the bottom (or pushed out)Simply get hot steam in the bottle and use an object to push the base inward.
How to repair a dent on my water bottle?
Fill it with water and swing it around with the cap off (possibly on a rope). Centrifugal force will push the bottom outward and fix the dent.
achieving a stable video-call experience with an infant or toddler
Here is an approach that might help out. Note: it may work better for a tablet than a phone.If you get a box, something like a cereal box thats a bit bigger than the tablet/phone. Cut out a section in the middle roughly the size of the screen. Then get 2 Styrofoam blocks like this and cut notches into it to put the tablet/phone in. One block should go on either side of the device, and they may need to be cut a bit to fit inside the box. Also you should probably use something like an ice pick or a pen to push a hole to where ever the speaker is to let sound out. Then use a piece of clear plastic to put over the screen. Preferably something stiff, so that touching the plastic will not cause the touch to register on the touch screen. To assemble place the device in the notches of the styrofoam and place the plastic on top. Then slide it into the box and tape it closed. All that should now be visible is the screen, but it will be protected from being touched by the plastic. Sound will still be produced (if it is muffled, make the speaker hole bigger) and even if you child drops it, it will have extra protection.Feel free to ask about anything that needs clarification.
How to make my keyboard not sticky?
You can try to use steam, but it will take some time. Unplug the keyboardUse a water kettle or something that can produce steam (be careful!)Hover the keyboard, upside down over the steam. Make sure the steam can rise between all keys (again be careful!)Keep the board upside down and put it on a dry towel to dry for at least 2 days or use something like a hair dryerAnother trick I learned to clean carpets (yes, carpets) is to put it upside down in the show and push it down so the snow gets pushed in. Maybe this also can be done with a keyboard if you have show around.Good luck!
How to make my keyboard not sticky?
Over time your keyboard gathers an incredible amount of dust, dirt and many other bits which inevitably results in sticking of the keys, to clean up you keyboard and make it feel as good as new...You will need:Cotton budsAnti-bacterial wipesAcidic solution/VinegarPatienceFirstly, un-plug your keyboard and tip it upside down and shake to remove any excess debris. Then remove all of the keys (these should just pop off and pop back on again with a little force, be careful not to break the clips underneath the keys).Place the keys in a container of acidic solution such as vinegar and leave for around 20 mins, then give them a good scrub with a cloth.Grab an anti-bacterial wipe or cloth and dip in vinegar or any form of alcohol solution and scrub the keyboard thoroughly, especially around heavily used areas such as the space-bar and enter key. Use a cotton bud/swab to rub the solution around the areas where the keys should be to pick out any grime in the crevices. You should be able to see the grime coming away from the keyboard, if not, scrub a little harder! Pop the keys back on by lining up the clips with hooks underneath and press firmly down, if you have a different sort of keyboard or any questions post us a comment.Good Luck and remember to be patient, there's no quick fix to restoring a keyboard, unless you buy a new one!
How do I stop water from splashing in the bathroom above counter sink?
If you mean a sink that's sunk into a counter top, it's next to impossible not to splash the surrounding area when you use it. It helps if the sink is a good size and deep, but sadly, many modern sinks aren't, so if you've got a designer type 'sink' that's more like a shallow tray (like one I saw recently in a friend's house), then you need to keep a towel on hand specially to clean up water splashes afterwards. I'm afraid those type of sinks are more for looking at than using, definitely a case of appearance, design and form over function.
How do I stop water from splashing in the bathroom above counter sink?
The most common cause for excessive splashing from your sink is how the water comes pouring from the tap, our taps are generally simple-crafted ones that release the water in floods. The best way to resolve this issue is to invest in a tap aerator, these break up the flood of water in the same way ordinary shower heads do.The tap aerators usually come with the regulator to fit them with too which isn't difficult to do.I found this one here.Hope this helps!
How to make my keyboard not sticky?
Most keyboards are dishwasher safe.  Unplug the keyboard from whatever you have it connected to. Remove any batteries and attachments (non-glued in place items, but not the keys). Place on the top tray of the dishwasher, face down. Wash using your normal detergent. Do not go through the heated drying cycle as it may damage the plastics. Allow the keyboard to thoroughly air dry before reattaching it to your device. Put the batteries and other attachments back in place.If you don't have a dishwasher, you can use a shower head to clean almost as much as the dishwasher. I would not add liquid dish soap to assist the cleaning as it becomes extremely difficult to remove all of it.
achieving a stable video-call experience with an infant or toddler
Try a cookbook stand with a clear plastic front. I use one to keep the pages of my cookbooks clean of food debris while cooking. That way you have a easily cleanable surface that won't affect your call between the tablet and the baby. That, or use a Chromecast to put the call on your TV screen.
How to remove the smell of Lenor Unstoppables from clothing?
You obviously have a strong opponent here - designed to stick to the fabric for weeks according to the manufacturer.So pretend to "use" it:Wash repeatedly, as hot and "rough" as the fabric will allow, air out as much as possible. Sun and wind will help break down and carry away scents. In cases like these, I tend to leave the laundry outside even over night, e.g. wash in the morning, hang to dry outside, leave out over night (dew falling and drying again in the morning), repeat.Expect the process to last a few days and of course do not use detergent with (strong) scent. Kind of obvious, but you don't want to add scent / bind the existing scent.
How to clean the inside of a hose
Assuming a rather thin diameter like the hoses used for milk on espresso machines or camelbak drinking systems:I'd go for a pipe cleaner - they come in different thicknesses and are quite flexible..They will probably be too short for the total length, so get some thread - more than twice the hose length in total, cut in half.Bend the pipe cleaner back and twist on both ends, forming a loop and making sure the wire end can't scratch the inside of the hose. Tie one length of thread to each loop on the ends. Use the threads to pull the pipe cleaner (soaked with detergent) back and forth through the hose. Rinse well.A very small but heavy weight (e.g. small fishing lead) clamped to the end of one string can make threading the thread through the hose a lot easier: just let it "fall" through.For thicker hoses, use the same principle, but use either a piece of a bottle brush or a piece of knotted fabric (with matching diameter) as the scrubbing part.
How to look / dress older?
I would say try to dress more practical rather than professional to appear your age. I'm in the same demographic as you, and I've found that just swapping to professional attire that doesn't suit your environment comes across as pretending to be a grown up. Swap out faded or torn jeans for jeans in good condition with a slightly higher waist(won't ride down when you sit). Wear clothing that doesn't have large amounts of writing or graphics. I wear glasses but I go for a more minimalistic look rather than a statement look. Basically, start dressing for how you live your life rather than how you think the world should see you, and you'll find that ironically this is the best way for the world to accurately perceive you as an adult. 
How to clean the inside of a desktop computer without a vacuum
A hair dryer on the cold setting will do the job nicely and good quality ones will even allow you to adjust the strength of the air flow. Yes, they might not be as precise as compressed air but way more cost effective than buying cans of air and a lot safer than vacuuming in small parts.
How to look / dress older?
You need to crank up your observing dramatically. On your way to work/school/shopping, at work/school/shopping, in the stock photos that you see online and in articles, in any paper media you consume, in TV ads for floor cleaners or prescription meds or beer, look, really look at the people. Ask yourself:does that person look roughly within 10 years of my age?does that person look like a funloving high school student, or a serious adult who is married and definitely 23 or more?from the context of the ad (furniture in the background, price of the item being sold) or article (is it about investments or a new pot law?) or what you can overhear of the subway/grocery store conversation, or know of the person if it's a real person in your life, are the people you see in the demographic you want to be perceived as?(You may gain some information from the men, but women will probably be your prime target.)Now start to take note of the appearance of the people who appear to you to be married, in their late twenties, professional, etc. This is the image you want to project. Depending on where you live and what income group you want to be perceived as (artsy does not look like lawyer) you will see different things. Earring size. Hair style. Makeup colours. Nail length and decoration. Sure, maybe some easy stuff like bare midriff or torn jeans, but more seriously how tight are the clothes? Are they layered? Do things "go together" or is it a pair of neutral pants and a top, a skirt and a top? How high are the heels? Is everything black? Taupe? Beige? Are there bold colours? Big prints? Chunky necklaces? Bracelets? Are the purses large or small? And sure, what do their glasses look like?Finally, don't feel you need permission to wear certain things. I used to envy women who wore floppy straw hats in the summer, especially with loose flowing dresses. I wished I could do that. One day, I realized they don't check for a permit at the stores that sell floppy straw hats. I bought one, and wore it like I meant it. It worked - not one person laughed at me for my affectation. If you want to wear more serious or expensive clothes, you need no permission. Just go buy some, and see what happens when you wear them.
How to clean the inside of a hose
I clean my hydration backpack by removing the mouth piece and rinsing it with hot water, letting it cool, then throwing it in the freezer. Once everything is frozen solid, I'll rinse it again in cool water. I only use my pack for water, so one cycle usually does the trick, but if there was anything else in the hose, more hot water to free it up/penetrate followed by a freezer cycle should break up most contaminants.

Use a very soft cloth (cotton). Attach a ball bearing to the cloth and run it through the hose. It will clean it.
How to remove sticker from car windshield without tearing it
If it is a plastic sticker, try to heat up the window from the other side of the sticker so it becomes somewhat loose, then you can gently peel it off and it should come right off.However, if it is a paper based sticker you will not have much luck since those are really fragile. If you want to clean your window completely (ruining the stickers) I would suggest using a screen cleaner foam and a razor. Soak the sticker with the foam and without applying too much pressure on the windshield (don't scratch it) use a razor blade to peel it off.
How to remove sticker from car windshield without tearing it
This process has worked well for me:Heat the sticker with a hot air dryer to loosen the adhesive.Insert the tip of a razor blade under one corner of the sticker.Work the blade behind the sticker about 1/4 inch.Press the loosened portion of the sticker against the flat side of the blade, then lift the blade and sticker together (slowly). If the sticker starts to tear, reheat and start another corner.Use Goof Off, acetone, or another solvent to remove residue from glass.Use contact adhesive if needed to improve adhesion to the new surface.The warmer and softer the adhesive, the better the end result.
How to remove sticker from car windshield without tearing it
Pour a very small amount of gasoline on ragRub the rag lightly and carefully on the sticker (I would suggest with your car door open)Use another rag or something else to rub the sticker off.Most should come off, and if it doesn't, repeat.
Easiest way to remove blackheads
First, shower with warm water and exfoliate your skin to remove the surface layers of skin keeping dirt and oil in there.After showering and exfoliating, you can use a pimple extractor device - a little loop of metal you use to gently press down around the blackhead - to help squeeze the black stuff out.  (you can buy them online on Amazon etc easily).To prevent it in the future, exfoliate daily with loofa or something else a little rough to help keep your pores clear.
Easiest way to remove blackheads
You can use mask from products you have at home to exfoliate your skin. There are different variants:cinnamon and honeyegg-whiteoatmeal and yogurtclay mask (medical clay)And you have to hydrate your skin to reduce fat production of the pores.
Easiest way to remove blackheads
If you don't want to buy anything, I would add to Natalia's method.Instead of buying an extractor or sorts, you can use the loop in a hairpin. Just push it in after you wash your face with warm water.Other method to use both of you thumbs. Position your thumb nails around the blackhead and squeze and push.Easiest way is to ask a family member. My sister does it for me.
Easiest way to remove blackheads
The best way to get rid of blackhead on your nose is to give em a good ol' squeeze  Use one of two things;- Tweezers- Hair clipThe tweezers are the best option, you can tweeze the head off and remove the juicy under-layer quicker than you can say.."ahh, that's the spot".As soon as you've finished, wash your face with lukewarm water and moisturise.Top tip: Dab some toothpaste on spots or blackheads that are a little bigger than normal..this dries it out and ensures quicker healing.
How can I keep the top floor of my house cool?
I don't like the approach of opening downstairs windows and closing upstairs. I advise the opposite. This lets the hot air come upstairs (it is going there anyway), and, once it gets up there, it can escape.The best and quickest solution I found when I was living upstairs in a non-airconditioned house:1) open two (ONLY two) windows upstairs, ideally these are at each end of the 2nd floor.2) place a window fan blowing OUT of one of the windows. secure the fan, and close any gaps so air doesn't blow out through the fan and sneak back in around the side of the fan.3) close all other windows.4) pull down blinds or curtains on all the closed windows... this will produce a steady stream of air moving through the upstairs. You will notice a huge difference in a short amount of time.
Easiest way to remove blackheads
I think a cheap and most effective way is to use Biore pore strips. It's something you buy, but you only need to use it a few times a month, so it will last for a long time. Some drug store brands pore strips works too, but I found those to be more skin irritating, so I think going with the original Biore brand is the best choice. The homemade method is natural and wonderful, but it's not necessarily the cheapest method in terms of money and time for a very clean result. The ingredients you need for a homemade mask are not the cheapest thing out there. I think it really just comes down to personal preference. :)
How should I re-attach the top sheet of paper that has come loose from a stapled group?
It sounds like the problem is pressure (force divided by area). The top sheet can move when you're turning pages, or it can even move laterally slightly. When this happens, consider the lateral force exerted - all you have are the two little staple legs holding everything together. The top bar of the staple might also help if it's pressed into the stack, but even that is quite small.Try putting a binder clip over the staple when you get the package. This should spread the force over a larger surface area and help the package last a little longer.If you need to use the package over a long period, though, consider punching holes and binding the package with file folder fasteners.
How can I repair cracked LDPE without a plastic welder?
I have repaired similar plastic items (in my case, a compost-holder) by pre-drilling holes and driving woodscrews into a suitably shaped piece of wood somewhere behind it. Your picture is not too clear, but here's a sketch:Don't use a countersunk screw, that would probably split the plastic. This will give you a stable mechanical basis which you can then waterproof with whatever is convenient (silicone perhaps).Success!
How should I re-attach the top sheet of paper that has come loose from a stapled group?
Don't try to staple it all the way through the packet.First, reinforce the torn corner. I usually use post-it notes and tape, which do not last long-term if it gets a lot of use. If you need to use these packets for a while, you might want to use paper tape.Second, staple the front sheet to the next set of sheets, anywhere from 5 to fifteen pages. Either staple it as close to the original staple as you can, or along a natural fold point if that's not practical. Preferably use more than one staple in more than one position - moving the paper around while attached to as single staple is what caused the problem in the first place. So if the original staple was in the top corner, either place two parallel staples a little farther "in", or two to three staples across the top or along the side. It's not a great long-term solution, but it should last a few weeks if you're careful.Proactively, when you first get the packet reinforce the first page across the staple with something that flexes well (such as duct tape), and over the crease lines at the edge of the paper. If it's a top corner staple, for example, take a piece of duct tape a little over an inch square and put it over the paper and staple, then wrap the edges over the sides of the paper (you can cut a small bit off the corner of the tape to prevent overlap).
What can be used besides rice to keep moisture out of salt?
Growing up my Mom had a salt shaker that came with a glass "cap" kind of that had some kind of purple granules in it. Have no idea what they are but it works. I have them now but don't use them. The salt is still dry as a bone.
How to undo slippery laminate flooring due to leather lotion
You could try some mineral turps or some kerosene to remove the residue of the leather lotion. Don't use lots, and test it on an inconspicuous area of laminate first.
How to undo slippery laminate flooring due to leather lotion
I just called the manufacturer:The product contains various waxes which stick to the laminate and - as you learned - make it darn slippery.Your everyday wipes will not remove the wax, apart from traces than may be polished off with lots and lots of ellbow grease and patience.To strip the wax, you will need a "residue remover", the nice lady recommended something from their own line, of course, the emsal Grundreiniger (Layer remover). Use less than the originally recommended dosage to start, perhaps a quarter, just to be safe. Use more if required.Another alternative we discussed are those "grease removers" based on orange peel. They are often sold as "Kraftreiniger", my personal favourite is the Sonnet Orangen Kraftreiniger (scroll down, here's an amazon link) I would hesitate to use the really strong ones like Oranex or at least dillute them very, very much.For both, testing them in an inconspicuous spot is a good idea, but if you start with very dilluted cleaner they should be safe, the customer support assured me.Independent of your product choice I would recommend using microfiber rags and plan for some scrubbing, mechanical action will support the cleaner's chemical reaction. Also, plan to "rinse and repeat", depending on how much product you got on your floor you may have to remove the residue in layers, not in one go.The most interesting recommendation I got from customer support was to always wipe the entire floor, not to spot-clean. Laninate will always have very small dents and divots where a tiny bit of residue stays behind - a mixture of dust and dirt and cleaner from your wipes, probably. Spot cleaning might leave visible differences between the place of the spill and the rest, not because it affected the syrface, but because it is niw actually cleaner than the rest of your floor. 
achieving a stable video-call experience with an infant or toddler
You can use an application to temporarily disable the touchscreen. Quick Google search resulted with https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.argotronic.touchblocker&hl=en such app for Android. You can use a toddler type case (something like this: http://www.laptopmag.com/images/wp/laptop-slideshow/269537.jpg) so that you can keep your tablet safer when you give it to your kid.Other thing is, you can show him/her how to actually use it. Both my baby cousins Skype with me when I am abroad. Before I left, I showed them how to use it, so they sit down, put the tablet with the tilt case on a flat surface and talk to me. Even if they want to move around, I told them not to pick up the tablet.
How to clean the inside of a hose
For shorter lengths you could use a gun bore cleaning kit- probably suitable down to about 3/8" OD and about 1' if you come in from both sides. There  may be even smaller caliber ones for pellet guns, but 0.22 (5.5mm) is very common. I have a tube like this on my cappuccino maker, and I just pull it off and run water through it after every use. A bit of a hassle but there does not seem to be any residue when it's cleaned like that. You can also sterilize silicone tubing by running it through the dishwasher - it may not remove the residue but any bacteria should be neutralized. PVC tubing might be damaged by the drying heat, however. 
How to look / dress older?
The TV show What Not to Wear has covered this a number of times, often with smaller females who have this issue (some even were shopping in the kids department, but mostly dressing like they were still students). If you can find those episodes online I think it would be a great reference in that Stacy and Clinton give the person various rules to follow when shopping, and they can be adapted to the situation and tastes of the individual.  
How can I repair cracked LDPE without a plastic welder?
Polyurethane-based glues/cements such as Goop bond fairly well to polyethylene, and are flexible and elastic, though they may harden with years of exposure to light and air. However, from your picture, there are evidently a number of cracks in the container. Once polyethylene becomes so embrittled that it cracks in one spot, I find that it soon cracks (or even crumbles) elsewhere. For that reason, I would not spend much time or money on repair, where the whole container is likely to disintegrate.
What can be used besides rice to keep moisture out of salt?
I've used a couple of dried beans (pinto, black, white) with good results. They're hygroscopic, just like uncooked rice. I get no clumps.I doubt those will fall through your shaker! :)
How should I re-attach the top sheet of paper that has come loose from a stapled group?
Loosen the staple a bit by unbending the staple's 'feet' on the back of the packet. (Needle-nose pliers if needed)Work the staple slightly upward through the packet to give some headspace between the top of the stack and the strap of the staple.On the cover sheet, slide the 'tongue' of paper (where the staple tore out) into the new headspace between the posts of the staple. Line up the cover sheet with the rest of the stack.Bonus: If you can, cut a thin strip of tape and slide that between the posts as well. Either way, place a bit of tape over that paper tongue.Press each side of the staple firmly back down in the stack.Tighten the staple by re-bending the feet. Press them firmly in place.
How should I re-attach the top sheet of paper that has come loose from a stapled group?
If you can stand the inconsistency, there's nothing stopping you from using a different corner (one of the three remaining) of the first page and stapling it to the second page. When issued a new packet as described in the OP, reinforce the stapled corner with tape to prevent this from occurring all together. 
What can be used besides rice to keep moisture out of salt?
We use orzo. It's a kind of pasta which is shaped like a slightly flattened grain of rice. It is a little longer than long-grain rice, and more importantly it is notably wider than a grain of rice, so it should not come out of your salt shaker accidentally. It is cheap, lasts forever, and available in multi-color which can be decorative if you have a clear salt shaker.
How should I re-attach the top sheet of paper that has come loose from a stapled group?
How about creating two packets of 20 instead of one packet of 40 papers. That way you can use tape to strengthen the ripped paper and reattach it with your stapler. See it as part 1 and part 2 of your book. It also lighten you load carrying less weight.
How do I know if a bread is whole grain (without the label)?
You can always ask the person selling the bread. It is best to look at the label as the colors can be misleading. 
How can I repair cracked LDPE without a plastic welder?
I'm not exactly sure what a "plastic welding kit" is, but I've made almost identical repairs with a Benzomatic propane torch (the blue can). The trick (in my case) was getting the pieces lined up enough so that they would stick to each other when heated, and for that I would use duct tape on the opposite side of the side I was heating, then remove that tape and reverse it for the other side, just for extra strength. It will never be as strong as the original, but if all you're interested in for now is a water tight seal, then it's a start.For reference, the can I'm talking about is here:http://www.amazon.com/C-R-Laurence-LP1759-Standard-Cylinder/dp/B002DVN7OU/They are relatively inexpensive (US$10) in hardware stores, and may or may not come with a torch top, depending on which option you buy.If you want to get really fancy, find other sources of LDPE (Plastic #4 if things are labelled) and make strips of "plastic solder" to add plastic to your weld. This is much more work, but will make the weld much stronger in the long run.If that's your idea of a "plastic welding kit" then of course feel free to ignore this answer, but again, I've had success with this, and having a propane torch around the house can be pretty useful for other projects too.Side note, the yellow Benzomatic cans are Map-Pro gas, and burn much much hotter than required for plastic, (can heat steel enough to bend small pieces) so definitely don't get that or the red can. (Not sure what it is, but I know it's used in welding along with the Map-pro.)
How to remove sticker from car windshield without tearing it
I've had a lot of success with hairspray and a razorblade. Simply spray the hairspray on the sticker, let it sit for ~5 minutes to dry somewhat, then use the razorblade to scrape off the sticker, starting with the corners if possible. As I understand it, the hairspray creates a bond on the sticker so that it doesn't break up into pieces as much. If there is any residue left, I'd use Goo Gone (Amazon Link) on it and it cleans up the adhesive very nicely.
How can I make sure that I wake up in the morning?
First thing, no matter what it takes, go to bed earlier.  Allow yourself at least seven hours (preferably eight) of sleep time, plus and additional hour without exposure to TV, computer, or smart phone screens before that time.Second, put your alarm in a location where you have to get physically out of bed to turn it off, and make sure it's loud enough to "wake the dead."Third, make a regular appointment for breakfast with someone who'll always be there, will expect you to be there, and will call you if you don't show.Do those three things, and you should solve your problem, as well as starting to establish long term habits that will protect against power failures, sick days for your "breakfast buddy", etc.
How to clean dirty white earphones
In case anyone is wondering if I did cleaned my white earphones, here's how I did it.They are not 100% white, but definitely a lot whiter.First I tried to brush them with toothpaste as suggested by @zzzzz , but I didn't quite see any plausible results, then when I was tired of brushing them and as a last resort, I sprayed them with bleach (that liquid that makes your clothes whiter) and brushed them again for another 2/3 minutes.I wasn't seeing any results, but then I sprayed them again with bleach and left them outside in a sunny day so they could dry and you know... I just sprayed them with bleach, they are all soaked, so I want them clearly to dry :) . After a few hours being exposed to the sun, they started becoming whiter. At the end of the day, the results were pretty good.Now I don't know if it was soaking them with bleach and its interaction with the sun, or the combination of the toothpaste then the bleach plus the sun, but they definitely became whiter.
How should I re-attach the top sheet of paper that has come loose from a stapled group?
Add a sheet of index stock to the printer receiving tray, so when the first sheet is stapled, it isn't the first sheet of the packet you received, but the index sheet you placed down.  That should be much less likely to tear.   If you are repairing an already torn packet, then restaple through the index stock sheet, so it will be less likely to tear in the future.  
How can I destroy sensitive documents without a paper shredder?
If you have a fire pit, or something similar that can contain a small fire, burning the documents will make it very hard to recover the information. Just be sure that the part where the information is located is burned, and use a stick or something to break down the ashes.
How can I destroy sensitive documents without a paper shredder?
Throw them in acid, if you don't have access to acid, throw them in water, and let them stay in for a while, then throw away the remaining pieces. You can also wait them to try, then divide them to multiple parts with a knife and then burn the parts. That will be pretty safe.

There isn't much substitute for the standby methods, burning or shredding.  Most secure is to crosscut shred, then burn, and finally disrupt the ashes by grinding into fine powder or washing down a drain.
How can I sharpen a knife?
One way is using the bottom of a ceramic plate or cup.On the bottom of some of these, you'll find unglazed ceramic where it's been cut, using this you can rub the blade of the knife along this unglazed edge, and because it's harder than the material of most knives (not hardened steel maybe) it will cause the edge of the knife to align, the same way a toning rod does.
How can I sharpen a knife?
If you have high grit sandpaper you can use that to sharpen your knife. Wrap it around something hard (tile/brick) and you can make a makeshift blade sharpener. 
How can I sharpen a knife?
A toning rod works because it's harder than the material it's toning, causing the material's atoms to align and eventually getting rid of microscopic dents and edges which gives the knife the most perfect possible edge for cutting.Due to this, you can actually use another knife to sharpen one, if you carefully use the back of your knife, and run the knife to be sharpened up and down it, pulling towards you at an angle of about 45 degrees.
How can I destroy sensitive documents without a paper shredder?
In cases like this, I tear or cut them into strips and put the strips alternately with the old paper and with the compostables (fruit and veg remains). Anybody wanting to recreate them will have to sort through huge amounts of old paper and rummage through disgusting compost.

Assuming that you can split the dough in half accurately:Split the dough into quarters in three steps. Save three doughs.Repeat step 1 with the leftover piece. Add a new piece to each saved dough.Repeat step 2 until you feel comfortable with splitting the remaining piece in three. Add the pieces to your doughs. You will have three equally sized doughs within your margin of error.

How to wash your rubber shoes
First and for most, you can use soapy water and sponge. Rub the sponge until its clean and you can dry it with a rag. This method cleans most of the material.Second is, if you want to achieve bright white color, put some toothpaste on the rubber soles and sides, and rub it with an old toothbrush. This should help you achieve a new look with bright white color.If the body of the shoes are cotton and the soles are rubber, you can make some soapy luke warm water and soak your shoes for a while. After that, you can just wash your shoes under cold water. For the rubber parts, you can use the above methods.Beware that, if you have writings on the rubber parts, they might fade away (they even fade away from regular use).I and my mom have tried above methods with most of our casual (non-leather) shoes, and it works wonders.

How to remove laptop security cable without damaging the the laptop
Without a key, the lock is useless (unless you want to pay for a locksmith to make another key), so I will assume damage to the lock will not be an issue. This is what I did, and I did it back to back on 3 locks (my staff likes to lose keys) so this was not a fluke.Get a straight edge screwdriver with a small head (It needs to fit inside groove in lock). Work screwdriver around groove to try to bend/break middle piece. Middle piece will eventually fail and break out. On all three, when it broke it made a gap in the deeper cylinder. Take a smaller, flathead screwdriver, insert it into that gap, and twist/turn. The lock will release. This all took less than a minute, does not take any strength or precision, but of course the lock is destroyed.

How can I destroy sensitive documents without a paper shredder?
Folding the paper onto it itself several times, then cutting the result as small as you can with strong scissors (nibbling away mm by mm), a carpet knife, bolt/ wire cutters, sandpaper/whetstone ... will give you a lot of cutting for a little :) I mention wire cutters because good wire cutters WILL cut paper too, and will probably survive a stack of paper better than average scissors :)
Easiest way to remove blackheads

How can I destroy sensitive documents without a paper shredder?
Has anyone suggested simply burying them? It would take a bit of effort to dig the hole, but the paper would biodegrade in no time. Alternatively, mix them in with garden waste and potato peelings and the like and it will all eventually become compost. Use that on your garden and nourish your plants with those unwanted reports and correspondence.
How do I avoid the crumbs at the bottom of the cereal box?
Blow air into the cereal bag to inflate it slightly.Slightly twist the top of the bag, then wrap your index finger and thumb around the twist.

I have been cleaning the Electric Iron over 5 years with Paracetamol pills and a cotton clothSet the temperature to the max level Rub a pill of Paracetamol on the hot surface, the pill will melt on the iron surface as you rub. Please make sure you don't touch the iron plate and burn your self during the process.Before the melted content evaporate off, iron the cotton cloth that you have prepared for cleaning.If there are more stains over the surface, repeat the same method until it is 100% clean and clear 
How do I avoid the crumbs at the bottom of the cereal box?
Remove bag from box rotate it 180 degrees. Place back in box and open package. The crumbs work their way to the bottom during shipping. The crumbs now on top will start to disperse from top to bottom.

How do I remove USB's plastic fragments from the USB port?
This might be a little riskier than Blu Tack, but what about something like acrylic caulk, which will shrink and grip the fragment as it cures?  You can make a "handle" out of the caulk after filling the port.I would advise experimenting and testing the tensile strength of the cured caulk outside of the port first.
How to heat up burritos, without the frozen middle
I use defrost cycle first, then switch to 50% power then to 30% power. Timing depends on how many pieces you are doing at one time. It also helps tremendously to have an "Inverter Microwave" - with inverter technology the microwave can actually put continuous fractional power into the cooking chamber instead of turning the unit on full on then off. 
How to hard-boil an egg in the microwave safely?
Using an Inverter Microwave, I bring a bowl of water to a boil first thenput in the egg(s) and then use 20% power to keep the water at a simmer. Timing depends on how many eggs and whether you want soft or hard boiled eggs. If I'm hard boiling a dozen or more eggs I use a pressure cooker.
How to remove scale/incrustation in bathroom
Your question is probably about removing the calcium carbonate scale that is left behind when water evaporates. Although you can use abrasives to clean it, this mineral residue from "hard" water can be softened using a mild acid, such as lemon juice or vinegar. Once softened, it is much easier to remove.
How to extend the lifetime of a rechargeable battery?
Most rechargable batteries can have their life extended by following a few common rules. Most batteries tend to wear out when used when they are very cold or very hot. They also wear out after a certain number of discharges, so using less power over time helps the battery last longer.The life of a battery also depends partially on the type of battery. NiCad batteries tend to "remember" charge levels, so they need to be discharged completely now and then or they won't hold a full charge. Lithium batteries should never be discharged without immediately charging them up again, and will die after a certain number of time due to their internal chemistry.
How to hard-boil an egg in the microwave safely?
You can use a toothpick to place a small hole in the ends of the egg puncturing the membrane.  This allows pressure to escape.  It will also allow some egg to escape as it expands, but not too much.  Place it in water as mentioned above.  I haven't done this in a few years, but I think 1.5 to 2 minutes is the cook time.
How to remove bicycle oil/grease from waxed jacket
You could try leaving salt or some other absorbent grainy material in contact with it. This would ideally absorb the oil. As the jacket is waxed, the oil shouldn't be penetrating the material at all so it should just 'wipe off'. 
how to keep blankets from slipping off the bed at night
We buy oversize blankets (e.g. king-size for a queen-sized bed) and tuck them under in hospital corner style. If there are two blankets, e.g. a light-weight one covered by a heavy quilt, only the lower blanket needs to be larger, as it keeps the upper in place.
How to deal with eraser shavings effectively
You can collect the eraser shavings for awhile, then once you get a small pile of them, you can start to make them into a new eraser. To make the new eraser out the shavings, you will need to have your fingers slightly damp, and then start compressing the shavings together. Start with the largest shavings first and dampen your fingers again as they dry out. After a bit, they should start sticking together and you can keep adding shavings to the ball you make. It should take on a consistency similar to silly putty and be slightly sticky. You can then use the new eraser to pick up more shavings and add to it, or as an eraser. Every time you use it (on different days), you should knead it with slightly damp fingers to keep it malleable and to prevent it from hardening. It can easily pick up new shavings, and you can then reuse them. 
How to deal with eraser shavings effectively

How can I react to an acne, without getting any marks on my face?
Usually squeezing spots is the best option but in cases of severe acne it's not that simple as you can end up with long term scars. The best option is simply to see a dermatologist, they will be able to provide you with the best information and treatment to clear the acne up. The earlier, the better. Acne usually develops from a build up of oil and bacteria in the skin, so try to use oil-free face wash etc and wash you face 2 or 3 times each day
How to extend the lifetime of a rechargeable battery?
Most batteries today are lithium based. Common rule is not to overcharge or discharge the battery below certain level. Chargers and appliances usually are designed in a way which does not allow over charging or draining the battery completely.The battery charge can vary depending on the temperature. So if you charge a battery on clod and then move it on hot it will become overcharged. Also if you discharge completely the battery while it is hot and then move it to cold place, the charge may fall below critical minimum.What you should not do:When the battery is discharged, don't put the phone in cold placebecause the charge level will fall below critical And don't put the phone on hot place when it is fully charged,because the battery will become overcharged
How to transport a glass without breaking it
Use a wooden surface with the size of the glass (or a little bigger) and attach the glass to it. You can use a sticky tape. Then wrap all this in cardboard. For extra protection you can use two wooden surfaces and put the glass between them. If you want to protect it only from the edges then you can use only a frame to hold the glass not a whole surface. But if it is a whole wooden surface it will also protect from frontal impact. 
How can I react to an acne, without getting any marks on my face?
I think you should go to a doctor for some advice or for some prescription treatment. If you feel that the doctor's method is not very effective and you are left on your own, I suggest trying some skin care product. I used to be troubled by acne/pimples, and I've tried a lot of different brands of cleanser, blemish treatments like Neutrogena or Murad, etc. Finally the brand that worked for me is Juice Beauty. They are organic and natural, nontoxic. Different people have skin that react differently to those skin care products, so you can't be sure how effective it's going to be until you give it a try. Usually, it comes in three steps:1. Cleanse2. Treat3. MoisturizeIf you are totally clueless to how to get started, I would say start with cleanse and moisturize while you are figuring out which treatment product works best for you. 
How to remove urine scale from toilet elbow?
Hard water scale can be removed by acid. White vinegar is a weak acid and may work, given time. Weak phosphoric acid as in a 2l bottle of cola may work too. Strong acid such as ~30% muriatic (HCL) sold in home improvement stores may corrode fittings and could cause other problems

How to clean 'Iron removal filter'?
Try the dishwasher! If it is small enough, I would suggest the silverware section. Pros: Super easy and fast. Cons: can't iron for a while (shucks) and possibly faster deterioration of the plastic.Note: I have never tried this before. If the filter feels flimsy (ie: the plastic or mesh) enough that it may be wrecked by putting it in the dishwasher, DON'T try this.
How to store printer ink without drying?
If you use a printer very infrequently, then remove the cartridge(s) and place them in the smallest air-tight container (e.g. a tight-sealing jar or heavy-duty zipper-closure bag). Many printers, though, upon replacing a cartridge and restarting, go through a brief self-cleaning cycle, which uses up some ink.BTW, printer re-inking kits are a great way to save the cost of replacing the entire cartridge. If you go that route, be sure to get a compatible kit that includes a device to reset the cartridge, if required.
How to prevent acne?
If you really want to be simple, you could just wash your face often—I'd say once or twice a day, and be consistent. It works after a while, albeit taking longer than it really should if you use a cream for the same purpose.

How do I dry off without a towel
First, watch this TED video (3:41).Then start shaking off your hands and other limbs (note: jumping jacks might not be a great idea if the surface is slippery), and then brush off the water from your skin (e.g. arms, shoulders, everything smooth) as if you were brushing off a bug or a few crumbs, but it's brushing off the water droplets instead.  The size of your hands doesn't matter that much in being able to move them quickly over the rest of you to remove most of the water.
How do I dry off without a towel
Assuming that you didn't go to the bathroom naked, you will have your worn clothes with you.Unless they are really dirty from sweat, dust or other outdoor dirt, they will, in a pinch, be a suitable towel stand-in. If you wear layers, e.g. a sweater over a t-shirt, the inside of the sweater and the outside of the t-shirt will be basically clean because they neither touched your skin nor gathered dirt from your surroundings. For other clothing styles, the same principle applies. Extra hint: T-shirts are very good for soaking up moisture from your hair.
How do I untangle matted/knotted hair
Before you start, do not, I repeat do not try to brush your hair from root to tip if you have knots or tangles. Not now, not in the future.Get a comb or hairbrush that can be washed with soap. If push comes to shove, your fingers will do.Find some natural oil. Most types will do unless they have a real strong smell, because it will be hard to wash out. Coconut or jojoba are common favourites, but in this case, a plain "cooking oil" should do. Hands off from extra virgin olive oil here. You could use a synthetic hair oil containing silicone, but it is a bit controversial as it will remain on the hair for quite a long time. But it should work well to make the hair "slippery", which is our goal here.Apply a generous amout of oil to your hair. I said generous, it should be really greasy. Use more during the next steps if necessary.Start untangling from the bottom / the tips. Use your fingers to gently unravel knots, try separating strands even if some knots remain.Use a comb or brush to comb single strands, starting with short strokes at the tip, working upwards with longer strokes. Ideally you will be able to unravel smaller tangles this way. If you have tight knots that don't come out easily, leave them for the moment. Make sure they are well-oiled.When you have untangeled most of the hair except for the most stubborn knots, they should have had enough time to "soak". Go back to them and gently poke, pull and pinch at them with your fingers trying to loosen them gently. You do not want to pull hard, be patient. At the back of the head you will have to use your fingers to "see" what's happening. Brush your now untangeled hair from roots to tips once again to make sure you got all tangles out. If necessary, go back to step 4.Wash your hair. If possible, do so in the shower while standing up. Use a mild shampoo, do not "scrub" or "knead" your hair. Gently work the lather down from your scalp towards the tips, rinse well. Do not rub your hair when toweling off or you go straight back to step 1. Gently "blot" dry by wrapping your head and hair in a towel.Enlisting the help of a friend or watching a movie is a good ideal - if your hair is really knotted, it may take quite a while to untangle. Note that donating tangled hair to Locks of Love might be a nice thought, but they explicitly exclude dreadlocks. Depending on the state of your hair, your tangles could be too matted to be usable for them. So untangle first, then donate, if you still wish to do so.
How do I dry off without a towel
You said the bathroom is near the busiest part of your house, then you can call someone and tell him/her to give you a towel. Or if you insist on not using a towel then ask for something else - t-shirt or other clothes.Or if you have taken clothes with you in the bathroom (clean or old) use them to dry your skin and after that you can change them with clean clothes again.Or you can take big piece of paper (usually every bathroom has toilet paper) and with tapping movement. No rubbing because the toilet paper will become on pieces.
How to transport a glass without breaking it
You can buy foam boards from a hardware store. Or better, you can just ask them for scrap foam boards that they are not using, and they will most probably give it to you for free. Then you can cut indentations to fit the sides/corners into the foam board. I would suggest taping cardboard around the glass so it is less susceptible to impact. The other thing is you can wrap the glass with towels, and ducktape them.
How to cut glass without a glass cutter
A carbide scribe (for writing on steel) makes an admirable substitute glass cutter -- in fact, before wheel cutters were common, hardened steel scribes were used routinely.In fact, anything that will scratch the glass and can be guided accurately enough will do exactly what a glass cutter does -- create a stress concentration that will cause the glass to break at a predictable location when flexed.  A file is hard enough, and a gunsmith's riffler file ought to work (a plain triangular file is used in chemistry labs to cut glass rod and tubing -- just scratch and snap).
How can I destroy sensitive documents without a paper shredder?
I have thought of 2 solutions for this:  Burn the document. Use a match to ignite its edges (Be careful) and let it burn slowly (NOT in flames). The fire will slowly eat through the document. Burn it until the essential part of the document is gone, then put it out by blowing at it.  For safety reasons, it may be best to do this above a bathtub filled with water. Also, be careful not to burn your hand.   Throw the document into water. After several minutes, it will be extremly soft and easy to rip. Just remove it from the water and rip it by hand into tens or hundreds of small paper pieces, easily.
How to move liquid from one container to another
Easiest solution when you can't carry the larger vessel is to use a Baster Syringe(I think everyone knows them as the turkey syringe), it might be a bit tedious, but once you've emptied the large vessel enough you might be able to carry the vessel and finish the task at a faster pace, unless the vessel itself is already too heavy or in reality just too large to handle.
How to move liquid from one container to another
Another option(and probably a bit messier one) is to use an old cup(or whatever measure works best) and start taking out the liquid, then use a funnel to pour it into the smaller vessel, and if it's cooking oil what you're transferring you can put a coffee filter in the funnel that way you can avoid any residues to enter the smaller vessel. 
How to move liquid from one container to another
The easy way: a siphon.You need a hose long enough to reach from the bottom of the source vessel, over the edge, and to a lower point outside the source, and a way to place the receiving vessel below the source.  Fill the hose with your liquid (if it's not something you'd want to drink, there are pump-hose combinations available for this operation), and as long as the lower end is below the surface of the liquid in the upper vessel, and you don't allow air to enter the upper end, the liquid will flow.  Flow may be slow, but the siphon requires no effort to maintain, and can be left unattended as long as the receiving vessel is large enough not to overflow.
How do I know how much charge a battery has left?
My take is that the multiplier in the formula is incorrect. For 1.5 volt alkaline batteries it is (voltage-1)*200. For 9 volt alkaline batteries it is (voltage-6)*33.3.  A 1.5V battery is exhausted at 1V and a 9V battery is exhausted at 6V.  A 1.5V battery has .5V of life and a 9V battery has 3V of capacity. You need to find the percentage of remaining life of that capacity. 
Tricks for opening very tight jars
Did no one else's mother use the hinge of the back door to open the ketchup bottle when you were a child?I am surprised.My dad used to go mad with her. It's not good for the door.Wouldn't work for full sized jar lids though.
How to cut glass without a glass cutter
I think it would depend on whether or not you want a clean(ish) cut or need to simply remove excess glass (a clearance issue for example).  I belt sander with a fairly rough grade paper on it will slowly remove small amounts of glass, but even with a glass cutter I have found it difficult to make clean cuts.  A glass cutter can be purchased at many local hardware stores near me for a few dollars tops.  I would recommend that if any "clean" cut is desired.
How to clean clothes that remain "dusty"
Hanging them in front of a powerful fan should blow a lot of the dust away. Or you could do it the natural way, and hang them outside on a windy day.  Just make sure they are well secured! Hitting them while they are hanging up (in the wind or near the fan) will help too.
How to cut glass without a glass cutter
It is possible to cut glass using a string that has been lit on fire, and quenching the fire with a much cooler liquid (water works best).Soak the string (twine is my preference, but I have used yarn) in a liquid fuel that burns (lighter fluid is my choice, but others use acetone or alcohol). Thicker string works better in most cases as you want to string to work like a wick in a candle, to keep the flame in a specific place.Tie the string around the glass.Light the string on fire. Use caution not to burn yourself.The hot glass may change color when it reaches a point where quenching will assure a good break.If the glass is small enough to fully immerse in the quenching liquid, fully immerse the whole piece as quickly as possible. If not, cover as much of the burning area as quickly as possible.You should hear a snapping sound when the glass breaks.Thicker glass will require more time for the glass to heat before attempting a break.
How can I sharpen a knife?
You may be able to sharpen the blade by using a brick or stone as a whetstone.
How can I destroy sensitive documents without a paper shredder?
Take the papers to your local copy shop and let them shred it for you. This is probably the easiest way to take care of them.For example, Fedex/Kinkos will shred documents for 99 cents per pound (around 100 sheets per pound depending on paper size and thickness).
How to start fire with wet fire wood after it has been raining or snowing
Fire from wet logThis was actually one of the summer camp challenges in outdoor organisation I was at kid. It was called fire from a wet log. You were supposed to start a fire using only:knifeaxematchespiece of log that has been under water for 2 daysThis assumes that the center of the log isn't completely damp. The solution was:chop down half of the log into big splintersuse knife to make thin wood shavings of the rest of the log. Make lot of them to be really sure. The thinnest the fastest they burn, the more energy they release per second.You now have a small piece of wet log, splinters and shavings. It's best to first pile shavings together, ignite them and only then start adding the splinters - this way you add them where they should be.This small fire will already be able to ignite wet branches, provided they are dry inside.Brushwood on tress (spruce and fir)Spruce and fir trees ALWAYS have dry tiny dead brushwood on the bottom side of their branches. This burns really fast and hot - it's better than paper and leaves cinder that produces additional heat. Usually, the brushwood on the ground near these trees is also reasonably dry.Bitch barkThe white coverings of bitch trees burns insanely for some reason. Be careful to only harvest the tom layers not to damage the tree. Bark on dead branches works just as well.ResinUse small stick to harvest some resin to serve as a candle when starting the fire. This can save you precious matches. Resin burns hot and long. Do not use knife to harvest the resin - you would damage the tree and you will have problems cleaning the knife. Some sources claim resin dissolves in alcohol, but I really recommend not contaminating anything with it.Use fire to dry more woodThis is probably obvious, but do not forget to put logs and branches around the fire (far enough to not ignite though) so that they are dry by the time you want to put them in. We used to make second barrier after stone barrier of wood. Shoes can go on the wood and wood can be used to prevent them from falling in the fire.
How can I clean a vase that I can't reach inside?
To get rid of almost everything, especially organic, use hydrogen peroxide mixed with sulfuric acid. Both can be about 30% concentration and are good to keep in your garage for those purposes. Mix of these is called piranha solution and breaks down all organic dirtiness.Hydrogen peroxide is sold in gardening supplies and paint stores. Sulfuric acid is also sold at paint stores and also as replacement acid for batteries.Sodium lye is also efficient. With those methods, use protection glasses and gloves. Gloves used for general home cleaning purposes will do. Those methods are especially good when normal soap solutions fail.
How to clean clothes that remain "dusty"
After laundry, you should fold your clothes and put them in drawer of a dresser or something like that. It might just be because your room or the place you live is kind of dusty, and the best way to deal with that is to vacuum your room more frequently, and if dusty clothes is such an issue, you should keep them in drawers rather than hanging in a closet. 
How to move liquid from one container to another
Even if Zeiss Ikon has already mentioned a siphon, I have to mention that you can actually use some sort of cloth that soaks water (i.e your tshirt) as a siphon. Just make the whole thing wet, and make sure that the part sticking out of the container hangs lower then the top of the liquid in the big container that you want to drain. And preferably a good deal lower. 
How to move liquid from one container to another
Get some bendy straws, join them together to create a 'hose' by inserting the end of one straw inside the end of the next straw, until you have a suitable length. Seal the connections with tape to prevent liquid/air escaping. place one end into your source container, and the other end over your destination container, which must be lower than the source. repeatedly seal and unseal the destination end of the 'hose' with the pad of your finger to create suction and start siphoning the liquid.
Utilising old clothes
Donate the clothes to a local charity that can use them. If you cannot find a charity locally, try a a local religious group.Doing that will help the charity, clean out your closet, and help you to feel good about being good community member.
How can I protect myself from oil splatter on my hand/wrist/arm?
You can change the handle of your frying pan with longer one and use a longer fork to put and take the products you are frying. This way you will increased the distance from the pan and will experience less splashes on your hands. And the splashes which reach your hands will be with lower temperature when reaching your hand.Use a light material for the new handle and don't make it too long because it may keel over the pan.
Utilising old clothes
If you have a sewing machine, there are loads of things you could do. You could make a patchwork quilt, or repurpose them into other types of clothing. Denim especially has wonderful results when made into bags and other accessories. Examples I have personally tried-Denim wedding dress, denim duffle bag, skirts, coats, and shirts. The limits are endless!
How to removed permanent marker from skin?
There's many options that will work. I'll name some:Soap in combination with waterAnti-bug spray (use it on your hand or a towel and then rub your face)Suncream (or spray works also)Those small wet baby-cloths (clean your skin with hot water afterwards)Isopropyl AlcoholNail polish or Acetone (on a towel and rub, clean it with hot water afterwards)Toothpaste (white and not in gel form, these don't work as good as others)Butter, put some butter on a piece of cloth and rub it on your skin.Water & Salt (not going to explain because it's the least comfortable and you don't want this, also takes up to 10 minutes)Coconut oil (Hot water + soap, rub it on your skin and then apply the oil)Most efficient:The most effective way would probably be using the hot water + soap first, and then apply the coconut oil. Rub it in and wash it off. If it isn't gone within 2 - 3 minutes then apply some Isopropyl Alcohol.
Opening and tightening small screws
Depending on how small the screw groves are (and how thin the knife blade is), you may be able to use a knife tip to unscrew the screw. Just be careful not to break the knife.
Opening and tightening small screws
I know some people might not open phones and computers as often as others, in my case opening devices is pretty much normal to me, so based on my experience; my answer to your first question is:Don't try to substitute precision screwdrivers, there's no better tool for these type of screws than these precision screwdrivers, other objects for example a knife like it was suggested by another answer, will probably unscrew the screw, but there's a high possibility that it will damage the drive, damaging the drive will just make the task more tedious each time you try to disassemble your phone. Until you reach the point where you will simply not be able to screw or unscrew the screw. So my advice is to buy some precision screwdrivers, of course there are the expensive ones but you can also buy some for less than a dollar, and they will do the job just fine. It's better to do this the right way since I genuinely believe finding a substitute tool for a small screws it's going to be more damaging in the long run.Again this is just my opinion
How to cool water inside an evaporative cooler
First, measure the water temperature after it's been circulating through the cooler's filter, with the fan running, for a while.  You'll find the water cools to the dew point fairly quickly (a figure that depends on the humidity) -- and it won't stay any cooler than that without spending energy continuously to refrigerate it.  In dry conditions, an evaporative cooler can in fact cool to around 15 C even when its 35 C outside (I've used them in these conditions).If conditions are damper, you may find you can't cool much if any below ambient -- if the humidity is 100%, the cooler can't cool below the temperature of the air by evaporation; all the cooling you'll get is storing heat in the water, if it starts cooler than the air.If you're in the latter state, you'd be ahead to buy (or build, if you're handy with tools and understand thermodynamics a bit) a simpler refrigeration cooler.  It will cool some number of degrees below ambient regardless of humidity (though it will require more energy to operate than an evaporative cooler).One alternative, for short term, is a large ice block with a fan blowing past it.  This will cool very effectively, but the ice only last so long, and you're paying for refrigeration to make the ice (or buying it from someone who did).
Opening and tightening small screws
I have used a piece of adhesive tape in the past.  You press it firmly against the head of the screw, then rotate the appropriate direction. To apply pressure more accurately it may help to press with a pencil eraser, the tip of a house key, or some other item with a small surface that is similar in size to the head of the screw.The technique is NOT going to tighten a screw as well as a correctly-sized screwdriver, but it does work in a pinch.
How to open oysters safe without oyster knife & glove?
A screwdriver will do. You'll want a Phillips, the wider the better.Take a towel and put it on a cutting board. Lay the oyster flat side UP on the towel, then wrap the towel over it, leaving the hinge exposed. Rock the oyster back a bit so the hinge is pointed up, and hold it firmly in that position. Insert the screwdriver into the hinge; you should be at an angle where a slip will end up with the screwdriver hitting the towel and board rather than your fingers. While pushing in firmly, but NOT as hard as you can, push the point of the screwdriver down and twist it slightly against the hinge. You should hear or feel a bit of a pop as the hinge releases. It can take a few tries to get the feel for it if you haven't done this before.Cutting the muscle loose may be a bit tricky with a screwdriver, but it should be managable. This is actually where you're most likely to damage the oyster, so be careful.
How can I sharpen a knife?
You can use a steel rod. My family always keeps one aout of a box when we are moving(aka every 2 years). How you do that is you take out a steel rod( should have a meatel, thick stick and a heavy duty plastic handle) take the dull knife and at a slight angle drag it aross the meatal part. Doing that miltiple times at a kind of fast speed will sharpen your knife.
How to look / dress older?
Try doing different makeup tricks to make you look older. When I put on makeup the right way, I look 30 when I am 23. Also try to dress more professionally, for example instead of a t-shirt and jeans, wear a skirt. The longer the better for a skirt, but go for a loose skirt, not a tight one.
Fastest way to untangle headphones
In the 5th grade I had the same problem. So did half my class so our teacher showed us a way. All you have to do is wrap the headphones around your hand then when you take them off tie some sturdy plastic or those twist ties you find at the grocerie store. This keeps them together and untangled. When you need to use the headphones just take off the twost tie and GENTELY pull the two lise ends of your headphones. This little hack has saved me many times in the world of headphones and mught help you.
How can I sharpen a knife?
A piece of cardboard can be used to sharpen a knife, especially if the knife isn't extremely dull and just needs that final touch to give it a razor's edge. Just sharpen the blade on the edge of the piece of cardboard as you would if you were using any other material. Run the entire edge against the edge of the cardboard on both sides. It is difficult to verbalize exactly how to do this without showing an example, so I found a useful YouTube video HERE.
How to clean clothes that remain "dusty"

How can I prevent pee from flying off-target?
Specifically regarding the "splitstream" issue:Sometimes a part of the opening to your urethra will be stuck to another part (for me, it's often after sex). If you have the state of mind to think about it, you can gently pull apart the opening to your urethra, to make sure that it is unobstructed.This solution is sometimes related to the 45 degree off-shoot issue, but not always.
Is there a way to erase pencil without a standard eraser?
You can use a magic eraser... the type used for cleaning (e.g. Mr. Clean).  These work very well as an eraser for pencil marks.
Removing dust from mobile's screen
I think  the safest approach is to take it to some phone repair place and have them help you with that, although that might or might not cost you a lot of money. If you would like to try it yourself, depends on which model of phone you have, you can look up information online for how to take apart and put back together a phone. This is a website that has lots of detailed step-by-step instruction on taking apart and fixing phones. https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown If you can find your phone on there, then you can decide if you want to take it to a repair shop or just open up your phone by yourself. 
Any use for pencils with broken lead?
I've seen people smash up the graphite into a powder, then use it in artworks or even home chemistry experiments. I used to make a powder out of it and have my family put their fingers in it, then put them on a piece of paper, forming a finger print! Hope you enjoyed these ideas. Have fun.
How can I neatly eat messy food without "common" utensils?
When eating you should concentrate on food, this makes the saliva run and mix with the food to make it more digestible.So try to get 5 minutes off to eat, rather the work and eat at the same time.This way your work space will be neat/clean, and your digestive system will be in perfect order.A motherly advice!
How can I neatly eat messy food without "common" utensils?
This might sound weird but whenever my friends and I have a bbq, we keep a small bucket of ice at hand, since we are usually picking up the chicken/ribs/wings/whatever you're eating with our hands from the container our hands tend to get sticky, whenever we fill like giving ourselves a "cleaning" we grab an ice cube and rub it against our fingers then just throw it on the yard. This might not avoid getting your fingers sticky, but it can help reduce the sensation in your hands. Works for me and my group of friends, hopefully you find it helpful as well.
How can I stop my glasses from slipping down my nose?
Glasses will often slip when I'm jogging. Got this pair of ear/spectacles hook. . Tried a few different types of rubber ear hook and this is the most comfortable so far. Here's more information,http://betasimplicity.com/wedgeclassic.htmlI'm not sure whether adjusting the glass temple will work for all people.

lying-in-bed-ideas to be remembered the next day
However you do  it, you have to make a note or record what you're thinking - the trick is just to confine it to a few words, just to jog your memory next day. I'm prone to the 'light bulb' moment when just falling asleep too, and I regularly jot down a few words on a pad next to the bed, but I do it in the dark. If there's a lot to write, I get up and put a light on and do it, because I know, if I don't, I won't be able to sleep anyway. I've even been known to get up and turn on the desktop computer to type something really important/urgent that maybe I've forgotten to do, then return to bed and sleep - once the note/s are made, I go to sleep quite easily, because I'm not worrying about remembering to do something or being able to recall that thought...If you've got a mobile/cellphone/smartphone, its easy to just speak into it.
How to shred papers/letters without using a shredder machine
Simple. Put papers in a mesh type laundry bag (that's big enough to allow them to move around) and wash and dry them. Don't forget the bleach. Destruction!!
lying-in-bed-ideas to be remembered the next day
Personally, I have very often reached out to my bedside table and found some object like a book, box of tissues, drink coaster etc, then I throw it across the room into a location where it doesn't belong. In the morning, when I wake and get out of bed, I immediately see the object and it forces my brain to reconstruct the thought process that led to it being there. I then write/type the idea somewhere before the daily routine causes me to forget about it.

How can I protect myself from oil splatter on my hand/wrist/arm?
I have used welder's sleeves when working a deep fryer. No more pockmarks on my forearms! They will probably cost you less than $10 from your local hardware store.Here's an example:http://www.homedepot.com/p/Lincoln-Electric-Fire-Resistant-Black-Welding-Sleeves-KH813/205141550These are 21" long, and they're designed to block hot sparks and metal bits. They work well for tiny bits of oil splatter. (Of course, they would not protect from a hot oil SPILL.)Alternative: Here's an 18" glove that's specifically designed for hot oil fryers:http://www.centralrestaurant.com/Fryer-Glove-with-Removable-Liner-c103p24074.html

How to get most of my free drink?
This may look a little bit weird, but if you do not care about that, here is what you do:Order a cup of coffee, (or tea, both are fine).Place the glass in the cup with the hot beverage.If the cup is too small to fit the glass, you have an empty soupbowl from your first order. Pour the coffee into that, and place theglass there instead.That should provide enough heat to melt the ice in a reasonable amount of time.
How to get most of my free drink?
When ordering, ask the waiter to hold the ice, or for less ice.  That simple.If you forget to ask for the drink in a form that'll do the most good, and the goal is for most liquid volume consumed, delay drinking as long as you can; the more liquid is on the ice, the faster the ice will melt and the less ice will be left to interfere with your drinking.  If, conversely, the goal is for the drink to taste best (i.e. be least diluted), drink off all the liquid immediately; then, when the ice melts down, it'll be just ice water.
how to keep blankets from slipping off the bed at night
The trick that worked was to only tuck in the top sheet, one blanket, and make hospital corners.  With all the blankest tucked under, they still ended up on the floor by morning.  I was surprised that the blankets on top of the one tucked in did not slip. Letting  the top blankets hang over a few inches, may have also helped, because there was less blanket weight pulling down.  Thanks everyone, I would have never thought of tucking in only one blanket. 
How to stop shoes from squeaking on hard floors?
I have discovered that the floor cleaner I use on my hard floors make the rubber soles on my shoes squeak.  When I spray the soles of my shoes with WD40 and wipe away the excess, the squeak goes away.  Although this fix is temporary, it is the only thing I have found that helps.  In the meantime, I am looking for a floor cleaner that won't cause my rubber soled shoes to squeak.
How to clean a non-washable cushion cover?
The label is probably due either to the linen content of the fabric (linen products are frequently labeled as dry-clean only) or the use of dyes that are not water-fast.  The complete care instructions read as follows:Do not wash.  Do not bleach.  Do not tumble dry.  Iron, high temperature.  Dryclean, normal cycle.Some things to consider:Air them out on a clothesline to get the smell out.  I don't see "do not line dry" in the care instructions, only "do not tumble dry".Try an "air fluff" (zero heat) or low/delicate dryer cycle; optionally add a dryer sheet for fragrance.  Enclose the cushion cover in a protective mesh laundry bag to mitigate damage.  Stain release sprays, special dryer sheets and protective mesh bags are often sold together as "home dry cleaning" kits.If you are willing to potentially sacrifice one in an experiment, run it through the laundry on delicate cycle by itself, with no other articles in the cycle, so worst case you only ruin one - if the dyes are not water-fast, any other articles in the same cycle would be discolored by dyes leaching from the cushion cover.
How to clean a non-washable cushion cover?
Depending on your location and the time of year, you can put the cushion in the snow and shove it around a bit. After leaving it for 15 minutes or so, take it inside to dry. The snow should have absorbed any stains and fumes.This also works for carpets.Good luck.

How to remove scale/incrustation in bathroom
You can use a toilet cleaner to remove the incrustation in your bathroom with these easy steps. Why I use a toilet cleaner is that, it is far more effective than a bathroom cleaner. I do this on every Sunday so that it keeps the bathroom fresh and clean. Step 1: Just apply or pour the liquid over the encrusted platesStep 2: Sprinkle water on the portions where you have applied the liquid and wait for about 5-10 minutes for the liquid to soak.Step 3: Brush the portions and clean with water. Make sure to wear gloves before doing this.

How can I make a bandaid only cover my fingernail?
I often just cut the Band-Aid to be the size that I need. I'll assume you have a typical Band-Aid, which is a strip of adhesive tape with a square of gauze in the middle.Cut off one of the adhesive "legs" just next to the gauze. Set the leg aside to be used later.  Leave the other leg attached to the gauze.Cut the gauze to the size you need.Trim the attached leg to the size you need.Finally, reattach the adhesive leg you cut off initially, and cut that to the size you need.Apply it to your nail (or, for anyone else reading this, to your cut / wound / blister / whatever).
How can I protect myself from oil splatter on my hand/wrist/arm?
Splatter guards or splash screens are helpful. Though available online, they may be sold locally for US$1 or so. You could make your own from a layer or two of fine metal window screen, held together with a central bolt for a handle. This works well for me, and only a few stray splatters exit when flipping fried foods. BTW, don't buy one with a heavy handle, which increases the likelihood of the guard from falling off the pan.

Cutting glasses cloths out of old clothing
Very clean cotton (dust in the fabric can scratch, which is why you aren't supposed to use the t-shirt you are wearing to clean your glasses). Microfiber is what everyone recommends, but I doubt you have any clothes made of that.Be careful with synthetic fabric, as I have heard a number of times that some types can scratch glasses (although never any specification on which types are safe and which types are not).If you are cutting a t-shirt, it shouldn't fray, but the ends will roll. If you are cutting woven fabric, use pinking shears to slow fraying.

How to remove armpit stains?
I follow this technique:Add a cup of detergent powder in half bucket of water and stir it well.Turn the t-shirts inside-out and immerse them in that bucket and let them soak for about 10-15 minutes.

Don't put the t-shirt along with all other clothes in a washing machine.

I use shampoo to clean my glasses.  While showering, lather your hair with shampoo. Use the lather with rubbing motion over the entire surface of the lenses. Rinse with clear water. Dry the lenses with cloths that will not damage the lenses (I use a microfiber drying cloth).The reason this works well is that shampoo is designed to break up body and hair oils.

Deep snow - Walking technique? ...without any additional equipment
It really depends on the snow. As a nordic skier I spent a lot of time on all different kinds of snow. And all you need to do to keep yourself up, so anything that adds more surface area without adding more weight will help, try buying some light weight wide shoes, like Altras for instance.
Deep snow - Walking technique? ...without any additional equipment
In general, when you are faced with difficult physical activity and you'd like to do it more efficiently, one of the tried and true methods of increasing efficiency is to repeat the activity over the course of several weeks or months until it is no longer difficult. This is often referred to as "exercise" (source):physical activity that is done in order to become stronger and healthiera particular movement or series of movements done to become stronger and healthiersomething that is done or practiced to develop a particular skillIf the walking technique in general is causing any confusion, one rule of thumb I personally like to remember is "left, right, left, right", although some choose to start with the right foot instead. In snow, while more effort may be required, the general idea is the same (with practice and a little luck, this "alternating foot" technique can be applied to mud, sand, and many other terrains as well).Essentially, it is something along these lines:(image source)You may have to lift your knees slightly higher because the laws of physics dictate that your foot and the snow cannot occupy the same space at the same time and so it will be resisting the motion of your feet, but the most important thing to remember is to keep up the alternating pattern (you can get yourself into trouble quickly if you attempt "left, left, right, left" -- I've seen it happen, and it's not pretty).There are a couple other hacks you can try as well to combat physical exhaustion. In particular there are three techniques known colloquially as "drinking water", "eating food", and "taking breaks" - over the long run these can ultimately increase efficiency. Alternatively, if all else fails, there is one I personally refer to as "turn around and go back home".Of course, proper equipment can also help, and the consequences of intentionally hiking 20km in deep snow with hiking shoes should not be unexpected. This was discovered roughly 4,000 years ago, and that solution has survived the test of time for good reason.
What is the best way to clean your glasses?
Try this one if you have these ingredients:Empty travel sized spray bottleRubbing alcoholLiquid dish soapWaterFill the bottle the rest of the way up with tap water. If you have really hard water you might want to consider using distilled water instead. A gallon of distilled water costs less than $1.Place the lid on the container and shake gently. If you shake it too hard the dish soap will become too sudsy.Use the finished product the same way you would use any eyeglasses cleaner. After spraying the solution on the lenses of the glasses, wipe gently with a soft cloth.That's it! So easy to make and so inexpensive.

I suggest you the following steps:Use this type cotton waste:Dip it in non edible vegetable oil.Most preferably use coconut oil.Rub it on your shoes rubber surface and thus try removing dirt.After everything, try to dry shoe under sun.This works as oil absorbs dirt and cotton collects them with the help of oil.Thus you get your shoes old shining back.

What is the best way to clean your glasses?
I wouldn't recommend using abrasive soaps or cleaning materials on glasses since most now these days have some sort of coating such as anti reflective on them which will get taken off by these.

How to wash your rubber shoes
You will need: Baking sodaWaterA small dishAn old toothbrushDirty Converse shoesGet a small container, and add some baking soda. Now, add a tiny bit of water.

After you scrub it in and get all of the dirt off, wipe it off really well with a paper towel. (You can use a napkin, a regular towel, anything to wipe it off.
What is the best way to clean your glasses?
My recommendation (as someone who wears glasses for nearly 30 years):Rinse your glasses with clear water (this removes hard particals which could scratch the glasses in step 2.) The put a pea size amount of non-regreasing soap or detergent or shampoo on your fingers and clean the glasses with circling movements Rinse the glasses with clear waterDry the glasses with toilet paper or paper towels or a dry and clean tea towel/ microfiber cloth If you are in the middle of nowhere without clean water,  lick the glasses with your tongue before using a clean microfiber cloth to wipe it. Licking sounds disgusting (and people will stare at you) but it removes even sticky small particals. I have no experience with moist lens cloths, but when I bought my glasses I was told not to use it, because small dust particals on the glasses can cause   scratches if you wipe them on the glass. Also some ingredients of moist lens cloths may be too aggressive and destroy the anti reflective layer of the glasses. Also very important: Don't use hair spray when wearing glasses or if there are glasses lying around you. Hair spray is very sticky (it does not rinse off and dust particals stick on it, too) and thus,  causes scratches on the glasses.

Most coin collectors will use brown sauce to clean coins that are not of the highest value. Indeed, in my teens I had a Saturday morning job in an antique shop, where brown sauce was used to clean the brass items.This has mild acid and mild abrasive properties.  A quick rub with a soft cloth dipped in brown sauce will bring up a shine on copper and silver coins.The brand of sauce is irrelevant.

How do I remove spray paint from my hands?
Hand washing paste might do the trick here. It is both soapy as well as abrasive, and helps clean your hands deeper than conventional soap. Here is a video showing the paste in action on what seems to be a combination of grease and dirt. You might even find a branded version that is specific for paint. All in all this is a cheap product so you can purchase a tub and try. Moreover it is very long-lasting so you technically won't be wasting your money too much in case it doesn't work.

I would separate them by main materials just to be on the safe side.

Especially if one side of the calendar sheet is blank/white , you can wrap the book with the white side up.

How do I prevent shoelaces from slipping through the holes when getting out of the shoes
The laces aren't long enough- the reason the lace slips through the top holes is because you need more room to get your feet in and out, and the laces aren't long enough to give you sufficient room. Usually, high tops come with extra long laces fitted, which enables you to slacken them and take them off without their coming out of the holes, but maybe you need more room or they weren't supplied originally. Not a hack, but buy longer laces...

A porcelain toilet feels cold because porcelain is good at transfering heat. You can buy plastic or wood toilet seats: this is a ring that is placed on top of the toilet, and attached to the toilet via a hinge.Plastic and wood don't transfer heat as easily as porcelain, so they don't feel as cold.

I had this problem some time ago and tested several suggestions. The best process is a two-step one. First remove the gunge by placing the coins in warm water in an ultrasonic cleaner like this one.Then soak the coins in a vinegar & salt solution. Overnight at least. Look every few hours & remove if possible.This resulted in sparkling coins with no degradation of sharpness. 
How to make my keyboard not sticky?
First thing’s first, unplug your keyboard. Dump out any excess liquid and mop up as best you can with paper towels. While it’s best to clean while the keyboard is still wet to minimize the stickiness, the process is much the same whether you spilled your soda 30 seconds ago or 30 days ago.To get rid of sticky keys, we’ll need to pop off the keys and clean the keyboard more thoroughly. If you have a standard keyboard, you’ll be able to find references to where all the keys should go if you don’t already have the layout memorized. For custom keyboard, it might be helpful to draw a quick map or take a picture with your digital camera so you know where everything belongs when you go to put things back together.For desktop keyboards, take a butter knife or a screwdriver and try to pry up one corner of the keys. You don’t need to use a lot of force; you should feel a pop and the key will come right off.To clean the keys you can wash them in warm water and/or use some cotton swabs. To put the keys back on, just place them over their correct position and press them until you hear a snap. They shouldn't feel mushy or sticky anymore, and if they do it’s probably because they either didn't set properly in the base or it’s in the wrong place.

How do I remove spray paint from my hands?
Just use coconut oil and baking soda to clean spray paint from your skin. Simple and natural! I use a cup and put 1/2 of coconut oil with a spoon and the other half is baking soda (a bit less than that if you see the mix very liquid) then mix it and use it as soap :)

How to remove bicycle oil/grease from waxed jacket
I prefer, you better go for dry cleaning services. On passing through all these comments and clarifications, I get that it will be some sort of stain. So to remove that, you better approach dry cleaning centers near you. But the service may be costlier. So you first decide on whether that bag is of much importance to you, that you have to get it dry cleaned after paying much. I am also attaching a link for you to do the dry cleaning at your home itself. May be, it may be tedious for you. Any way, if you approach such a center, cleaners will beable to tell you whether that stain is removable or not. They may also tell, how much they can remove.So you decide upon that. Since, most of them are using powerful chemical agents for cleaning depending upon the material, you do not have to worry about material in that case.

How to deal with eraser shavings effectively
An option can be using erasers that are easier to use, so you don't need to put to much pressure and they generate less shavings. I found this example online. Also, I found a solution similar to the one you suggested but this one looks easier to use. 
How to remove fingerprint stains from a computer mouse?
If its not the surface being worn away, but simply dirt, some of it should have shifted when you used the household cleaner. If it wasn't touched at all by that, its likely its staining because the top surface is no longer intact from wear over time. If, though, some of the marking did shift, then take a dry cloth, spray a few times with an ammonia based cleaner (Mr. Muscle kitchen spray in UK), make sure the fluid is absorbed into the cloth by folding together the areas you've sprayed and pressing lightly together, open it up again and then rub the dirty areas with that. If it comes off straight away, wipe over with a damp cloth and dry it thoroughly, but you may have to repeat the procedure more than once - ammonia based cleaners are more efficient if you're able to actually spray the dirty area, which, in your case, you can't. 
Neatly open cereal box
When I'm opening a new box of cereal, I have a spoon in my hand/nearby already.Turn the spoon around so that the handle is sticking out. Place the handle between the top flaps of the box (you may have to start inthe middle, where there is less glue). Slide the handle "blade" downthe length of the flap, dislodging the glue on both sides. Open the box easily.Hopefully, this helps someone. :-)
How to remove fingerprint stains from a computer mouse?
First, unplug the mouse or remove the batteries. Use a disinfectant wipe (not too damp) for the up- and downside of the mouse. Then use a dry microfiber cloth for any remaining stains.
How to remove fingerprint stains from a computer mouse?
Isopropyl alcohol (also called isopropanol or dimethyl carbino) which should be available in any chemists/drug store, is an excellent cleaner. Simply invert the bottle on a (woman's) face cleaning pad and wipe the surface. It's also great for cleaning the underside of mice getting rid of the gunge which builds up there.
How to remove printed labels from the backing easily?
A hairdryer!! Just as someone else had posted; i used a hair dryer in one corner and heated it quite well. Then picked at t he corner and it came up fairly easy and peeled it down. some of the paper wanted to stick and not peel in the middle so I heated that up too. Presto, I had 8 small sheets of contac paper peeled off in less time than it took me to do the first--ugh!
How to put a slipped bike chain back on the freewheel without getting dirty?
I've found that If I accidentally shift to far one way, I generally am forced to stop pedaling. At this point while coasting, I backpedal a bit to give the chain some slack, move the shifter in the opposite direction that it slipped on, and slowly pedal forward. The chain generally catches on a cog pretty easily doing this, and on the plus side, it's hands free and I don't have to stop to fix it. Obviously, if the chain is caught somewhere tight this won't work, but if it's just fallen off a gear, this gets me going most of the time.
How can I organize Micro SD Cards?
The credit card microSD card holder suggested by mattdm inspired me to make this. It's part of a foam insert from a cheap cell phone case. A lot of different products come with this common packaging filler material. I cut it down with scissors, cut little slots in the sides with an exacto knife, and stuck a write-on label on it.  Mine's 3 x 1.4 inches and hold 10 cards, 5 on each long side. The cards feel secure in it, and I plan to carry it in a snack size ziplock baggie with card adapters and cables and other micellanea. It would also fit in an altoids can if that's more your style. The colors on the microSD edges are nail polish. Not the prettiest solution, but it'll get the job done. 
How can I organize Micro SD Cards?
I found this option which is very cheap and cute and you can use an indelible pen to write something small in the plastic to remember what the cards are. Another option for the labelling could be getting some stickers and stick them in the plastic so it's easier to see the name.

How to remove permanent marker from furniture, clothes, skin etc
Removing permanent marker from skin: HAND SANITIZER.Most of us do not walk around with rubbing alcohol or soap and water on our person.  However, many of us do carry little individual-sized bottles of hand sanitizer (gel). Squeeze some on the effected area and gently but vigorously rub with fingers then wipe with tissue, paper towel ... or whatever is handy. Stubborn marker may need to repeat the process or scrub with fingernails, then wipe with tissue, paper towel, etc.
What is the best way to clean your glasses?
If plain water and a lint-free tissue or paper towel does not work, soap and water will break up grease and remove particles.  However, if soap and water are not readily available, try rubbing alcohol (alcohol wipes, say, that might be in a first-aid kit in your car).  I keep some in a spray bottle and use it on all of my glass surfaces.  It breaks up dirt/grime/grease, does not damage glass surface, and dries super-quick with no streaks.  White vinegar also works.
How do I untangle matted/knotted hair
Try completely saturating your hair — while wet — with a deep conditioner, then cover (if you can) with a plastic cap (the kind used in hair salons; can be inexpensively purchased from amazon) and sit under hair dryer hood for about 20 minutes.  This deep conditioner will do what it does: softens and relaxes hair from its more tightly wound natural state, and makes it easier to begin to work through with a comb.  If you do not have a hairdryer with a hood, try putting a damp bath towel in the clothes dryer for 5 minutes, or so — long enough to warm but not completely dry the towel.  Wrap warmed towel around the plastic cap on your damp/conditioned hair, until the towel cools.  Can repeat by returning damp towel to dryer — again, just be sure towel is still a little damp and warmed, not completely dried as this will cool off more quickly.After deep conditioning with heat, begin detangling — preferably with a wide-toothed comb while conditioner is still in your hair.  Once detangled, gently shampoo as you normally would, then use a basic conditioner to comb out what few tangles may have returned from shampooing.To avoid the frizzies and re-tangling while drying, try — as suggested by another post — patting dry with towel, or wrap your hair in a cotton t-shirt.  This will absorb the water as would happen with a towel, but the smoother surface/texture of the t-shirt does not contribute to the friction on your hair caused by nubby towels that encourage frizz/tangles.
How do I know if a bread is whole grain (without the label)?
In this case that bread is not whole grain, in general whole grain bread is darker. Also whole grain bread is not as soft as white bread.
How to stop shoes from squeaking on hard floors?
The best way to stop rubber soles from squeaking due to the "gription" on a floor is to rub a bar of soap on the sole. The cheaper the bar, the better it works. Just a pass or two in the sole and you're done. One might think that it would make the shoe slippery but it does not. It actually improves traction. 
How to warm up milk for the baby during a trip?
This is the perfectly matching solution for you. You can use a Portable boiling cup.

I use this mug regularly. Regarding the mug, since you use this to feed the baby, make sure you clean the item well after use (If you put milk straightly into the mug)If you are not traveling by a personal vehicle, you may be able to use a power bank (may be two) to supply power for this (You can use a high capacity mobile phone power bank for this http://www.ebay.com/itm/Orange-20000mAh-Dual-USB-Portable-Solar-Battery-Charger-Power-Bank-For-Phone-/371587780496?hash=item56845b8f90:g:l5AAAOSwZ8ZW-6Er ). In that case you should find/build a adapter to get power from power bank to the mug/heater.Please comment on this, if you need any advice on this. Thanks! 
How can I shrink my clothes?
Washing in Hot water and/or drying on High Heat setting usually works. Although, I am sure this depends on the type of fabric you are attempting to shrink. I know it works on cotton shirts and denim jeans. Careful because it may ruin some fabrics.
What office equipment can I use to safely observe a solar eclipse?
This is probably the most important part of this website. If you ever want to view a solar eclipse—whether it’s total, annular, or partial—the first thing you must know is this:Never view the sun with the naked eye or by looking through optical devices such as binoculars or telescopes!This is critical! Why? You may have taken a magnifying glass out into the sun and burned leaves with it. If so, you’ll remember that when sunlight is focused onto a small spot with a lens, it gets hot enough to start a fire. So understand this: you have a lens just like that in your eye. If you look at the sun, your eye’s lens will concentrate the sun's light and focus it onto a very small spot on the back of your eye, on the retina. This literally burns your eye, causing permanent eye damage or blindness. In additional, there are no pain sensors inside your eye—so you won't even know it's happening!
What office equipment can I use to safely observe a solar eclipse?
The silvered mylar wrapper on some kinds of candy or laser/copier toner, computer parts, etc. has such a thin aluminum coating on it that it's slightly translucent.  Hold a piece that looks like a mirror up to the office lights; if you can easily see a fluorescent fixture through it, it's probably too thin, but if it completely (or almost completely) blocks the light from an office fluorescent, it's dense enough for safe viewing of the sun.  As a bonus, your view will be much clearer than with a pinhole projection; I've used this method to view sunspots, which requires higher resolution than an eclipse.Don't use this method with any kind of magnification; the extra light gathering of binoculars or a telescope might still let enough light in to damage your sight.
How to store printer ink without drying?
Easy tips to avoid ink drying outMost of you must be facing the problem of ink drying out. For this store an ink cartridge in an airtight or zip-lock plastic bag. Keep it in a cool and dry place. Do not let it expose it to the sunlight and heat.  Keep the cartridges in the head down position. It will keep it moist and will help prevent cross-contamination of colors. Do not let the cartridges touch any electronic parts. It will damage and disrupt printer and cartridge connection. Do not use plastic container for color ink cartridges when you will bring them to the refilling stations. To prevent cross contamination of colors, use the original box or cover the print head with a paper towel. Carefully remove and insert the ink cartridge in the printer and from the printer. Circuit board might get damaged if you force the cartridge in and out. last but not the least, even after doing all this, if you are left with changing the cartridges search for the best compatible toner cartridges suppliers. If you don’t get the equal or better quality of the cartridge it is likely to damage the printer. 
How to store printer ink without drying?
I cover the nozzle of the cartridge with a piece of painter's tape.  What kind of printer? I recall hqving HPs that had the jets integrated with the cartridge. But Epsons have a permanent print head with the cartridges just being tanks.In the latter case, you hqve mechanisms in the printer itself that suffer from disuse.A cheap laser printer is probably best for "occasional" use.  A style like the HP, with carts removed and hermetically sealed, would be OK for a cheap color printer. The kind with internal plumbing needs to be used or undergo a laborious cleaning process.
What is the best way to clean your glasses?
Over long experience, I have noticed that the product that "works" varies with each pqir of glasses I get! What is great before is no longer good on a new pair.  I always suspected that it depends onnthe coatings and exact material.What does work, but isn't as handy as spray cleaning products, is a bit of liquid-pump hand soap. Spread it out with fingers and continue to rub it in, then rince — lots of rinsing.That can be a fallback for when the usual is not working.I have found the single-use wipes vary in usefulness from great to pointless. Each brand/store is different, and I've been disappointed. Traditionally, a "bar cloth" is good for drying them. These days, a microfiber cloth is your friend. It's a total game changer! You can get a very find silk-like microfiber sold for the purpose, and it can wipe off both oily stuff and wipe after rinsing.  A more common napped microfiber cloth is also useful for wiping off oil without having to do a full cleaning.What I use now for my reading glasses is an ultrasonic cleaner. I keep it filled with filtered water that has a tiny amount of floor&tile cleaner added, and that lasts about a month.  
How can I organize Micro SD Cards?
To literally label them so you can tell them apart, you need only to make them distinguishable. Think resistor color codes: use a couple different "light" (writes on black background) Sharpies to give each one a distinct color code.  You can also completely color over one side with the white/silver Sharpie, and then be able to write a single digit or letter on it using an ultrafine Sharpie.This is in addition to keeping them stored nicely, with compartments matching the code and full labels for what each one is.
How do you safely charge your laptop in your car?
Common (nominally "12 Volt") automotive electrical systems vary in actual voltage from about 10 V (during starting draw in cold weather) to around 14 V (maximum charging voltage).  Any car charge is already up-converting the voltage to the 14 V to 19+ V needed to charge a laptop, so should have some level of internal regulation.  This regulation generally need not be especially precise, because the charging circuits in the computer also have regulators, including the "smart" circuitry needed to manage lithium-ion batteries.Therefore, it's very unlikely that a car charger can damaged your computer's motherboard; the only likely failure modes are "dead" (no voltage out) and "straight through" (battery voltage appears on the connector rather than correctly converted voltage) -- and the latter will be a lower voltage than designed, so will do no damage.Now, if you drive an electric or some hybrid cars (Leaf, Prius or others that don't have a separate 12 V battery for accessories) it's very slightly possible that a fault in the car's systems could connect much higher voltage to the outlets in the car -- so, in a Prius, you could get full motive battery voltage (96 V, as I recall) at the nominal 12 V outlet.  This is very unlikely (such a failure would also destroy all 12 V accessories in the car, so it protected against), and further would instantly destroy the charger's circuits, so it's doubly unlikely it would harm the laptop.
How do I untangle matted/knotted hair
This sounds crazy, but the Wet Brush changed my life. No extra products or processes required, and it can be used on wet or dry hair. FYI, I have no association with the company.
How can I stop my glasses from slipping down my nose?
Buy lighter frames.  You have a nice Persol frame.  I have John Varvatos. I love the look, but they are somewhat heavy and, much to my frustration, frequently slide down my nose, too.  I have a friend who just got a pair of glasses with featherweight Oakley frames.    I tried them on and those babies aren't going anywhere. I will be getting a similar pair when it's time for my insurance to spring for a portion of the frame cost.
How can I stop biting my nails while I think?
I think a good solution would be stop chewing stuff rather than picking an alternative object to chew while you are thinking. Try to keep your hands occupied and busy such as by playing with "thinking putty" (if you google that, you'll see what I'm talking about). Something similar you can play with are those stress balls you can squeeze. I think start with keeping your hands busy would prevent you from chewing your nails, and if you can keep that for a long period of time, maybe that will solve your problem and get you back into good habits. 
Clean mixed coins
Expensive, but you could use a firearms brass tumbler.  It is a vibrating machine filled with a media like rouge on corn cob bits.  Pour your stuff in, turn on, walk away.
How to transport liquids without spilling?
You could make a surface carried with hooks (above the surface of the liquid) and then carry it by means of a rope to your hand. This should keep the surface of the liquid and the carrying surface parallel at all times, any (non-violent) swings you induce will generate a centrifugal (intertial) force (not really a force but...) keeping the liquid in the container. Here is a commercial example but you could make it for yourself.
How do I prevent shoelaces from slipping through the holes when getting out of the shoes
Edit:I have recently adopted corset lacing, which is a continuous lacing method, for my two year old daughter's shoes to stop unlacing when putting shoes on a struggling toddler. I use a standard reef knot instead of the method described. There are two benefits to using a simple reef knot, (1) the result looks very much like a standard bow, (2) it can't get caught or pulled and untie, which is critical in my situation. The drawback (bonus for me) is it's not a slipping knot and requires slightly more doing to untie.Original:As has been suggested, your laces are essentially too short. There are a couple fundamental options, (1) longer laces, (2) a lacing technique that results in longer ends. In my opinion, Ian's Shoelace Site is the go to site for tips and tricks to help with shoelaces. Ian literally has "Tips for Everyone."Speaking directly to your issue Ian provides says this:While the obvious solution for excessively short shoelaces is to  replace them with ones of the correct length, here's some great  emergency measures, especially if one lace end has broken at short  notice and there's no ready replacement.In his comparison of lacing techniques there are currently nine methods he suggests to "Lengthen" lace ends significantly, assuming replacing your laces isn't a option.Replacing your laces with longer ones is probably a better solution and provides information about shoelace lengths saying this:The rhetorical question: "How long is a piece of string?" is a serious  question when it comes to shoelaces. Too long and the ends can drag or  get stepped on. Too short and it can be difficult to tie a knot.Your concern about longer laces being too long is absolutely legitimate and you'll find methods for shortening your laces by changing your lacing technique in Ian's veritable treasure trove of tips and techniques about shoelaces. Ian also provides links to other shoelace sites in case you don't find what you need at his site. His YouTube channel, Professor Shoelace, is also a great related source. It turns out that lacing your shoes can be complicated and personal and I think trying to provide a single definitive answer would be folly; I hope you'll be able to find a solution that really works for you now.
How can I watch a 3D movie if I already wear glasses
There are many options that you can do, but none of them are preferable.You can just wear the 3D glasses over your regular glasses, but may be uncomfortable.Wear contacts. This may not be a option for many, but it will be a lot more comfortable.Wear the 3D glasses by themselves. This is a good option but you might not be able to see.Avoid 3D movies. If you can't do any of the other things, a regular movie is also a good choice.
How can I watch a 3D movie if I already wear glasses
Assuming your movie theater doesn't change the type of 3d between movies, you can get a pair of the glasses from the theater (or a friend).  Take the arms off the frames. Drill a hole small enough to be inside the edges of the frame but large enough for some wire or string or fishing line to temporarily tie to your (vision correcting) glasses.The final product should like sort of like clip on sunglasses over your own.
How can I watch a 3D movie if I already wear glasses
There are a couple ways to go about a clip-on solution that might be appealing to people not comfortable wearing contacts or glasses over glasses. DIY VersionThere is a detailed post about creating 3D Clips For Prescription Glasses that addresses this precise issue.The simplified version is: use a set of clip-on sunglasses, harvest the lenses from a set of theater glasses, pop the lenses out of the clip-on, use them as a template to cut replacements from the 3D glasses, and pop in your new 3D lenses. Note: I'm comfortable wearing 3D glasses over my glasses so I have not used this DIY technique.Commercial optionsCompanies have figured out that people who wear glasses sometimes want to watch 3D movies and have started producing clip-on solutions. The notable boon to a commercial option is not having to deal with cutting, trimming, fitting, and aligning polarized lenses into a frame they weren't designed for.A couple examples include:Circular Polarized Clip on 3D Glasses for RealDPassive Linear Polarized Clip On 3D GlassesA quick search on Amazon yields a lot of options.Caveats Different 3D technologies use different methods of polarization andit's important to have versions for eachThis only works for passive 3D technologies. Active 3D is a whole different ball of wax.

I spilled yogurt on my car leather seats. What is the best way to remove it?
Saddle soap and warm water is a good way to clean leather. Dampen a cloth and wash/clean in a circular motion. Use a dry cloth to wipe up the soap and water and then another damp cloth to wash off the remains of the soap. A dry cloth to wipe up any remaining water and allow to dry naturally without direct sunlight on it. Once dry give the seat a rub over with a leather conditioner.
How can I safely trim my fingernails without a fingernail clipper?
Drug stores sell small fold-up key-fob sized scissors, two to a pack, hanging on the side of the end-cap where the sewing needles are sold, usually the back half of the store.  Also in the school supplies aisle there are little blunt scissors for kids.  You can keep your fold-up scissors on your key ring along with your p38 or Coleman lookalike (spoon/can-opener) and any keys to far-off places that you may end up visiting once more before you die.  Tie the keyring on the end of a lanyard braided of brown or gray shoestrings.  Thread the end through the small finger-hole on the kids school scissor, drop the whole mess in the front pocket on your backpack, and bring the lanyard out to secure the loop with a locking clip provided by the pack.  Now you have no need for a knife, and you can cut hair and nails, and other things.  When cutting nails with a scissor, use the right hand to cut the left nails as you would expect.  Then hold the scissors in the left hand backwards, pointed toward you, and trim the right nails in little chips.  You have to do it this way because of the order in which the blades are stacked. Pick up small dead sticks for your cooking, larger ones for your heat.  I've never used a knife out of doors in seven years.  Three of those were the last three years of eleven on the street, and the last four years relying on foot transportation and camping to get me where i need to go when i have to leave the roof I'm under.  Good Luck.
Showering while avoiding patch to get wet
You can purchase waterproof bandages to cover the affected area.  I have found that they usually work well, except in areas of the body that bend a lot (pointed ends of the knees and elbows).If you have paraffin wax, you could use it to cover the patch. You may have to put something between the wax and the patch to prevent the patch from being removed when you remove the wax. I have used post it notes when I got desperate.Three major advantages to using paraffin:It will fill in irregularly shaped areas without too many issues.It can be re-used a lot.It feels really good (most of the time) to have a little heat on the injured area.Downsides to using paraffin:It is very brittle. If you have to move the area covered, it will most likely break.It is easily overheated and can burn you.If the area affected is subject to swelling, you might want to check with your doctor before using paraffin. 
Showering while avoiding patch to get wet
Plastic food wrap works well for a temporary covering. Cover the area and include a margin of about 10 cm (4 inches) on the ends, to prevent seepage from reaching the patch. Tape the overlap a bit to prevent loosening.Though I've found this sufficient to keep a bandage dry during a brief shower, it's not suitable for long immersion.Paraffin wax would seem a poor choice, as it is not adherent to skin and it is brittle.

How do I get a new ball pen to flow?
I usually run my new, scratchy ball point pens on some newspaper until they 'click' into their smoothness.Personally though, I find heating up the ink mildly tends to help greatly, hence I usually leave it in the sun for a while (or better, an incandescent bulb for a few seconds).

Don't downvote, hear me out...Take a latext condom. Cut the tip/end off.Roll/slip the condom over the patch.

How do I get a new ball pen to flow?
The one thing that helps me a lot with this issue is to use the pen against the sole of my shoe, I really don't know why or how it works. I was given this tip as a kid by an older friend and I've done it ever since. Draw a couple of lines on your sole and they're gonna start coming out smoother and smoother with each "stroke" you do. I've done it on running shoes, dress shoes, and boots.

How do I get a new ball pen to flow?
I know, it sounds gross, but many times I've just licked the tip of the pen, and usually that helps the ink to start flowing smoothly.
How do I remove a bandage from thin skin?
Though it's similar to Gwenn's answer, I feel like it's worth mentioning Self-Adhesive Wrapping. There's no glue or pins. You just put down gauze (or whatever)Wrap it. Cut or tear like duct tape.Then peel it off when finished.
Tumble-drying a fitted sheet without getting other things tangled in it
Just get some chip clips and fold the fitted sheet in half, holding it with the clips.washes and dries just fine.
Safe storage of blender blades
One thing you could try is using some thick tape that isn't easily cuttable, such as electric tape. Wrap it backwards (sticky side out) around the blade, but not too tightly. Once you have it fully wrapped, you can then wrap it the other way to cover the sticky part. Once wrapped both ways, it should still be flexible, and should fit around the blade nicely. And it's probably about as sanitary as cardboard, but you should probably at least rinse it with hot water before using.
Safe storage of blender blades
If you have the plastic top from a spray can of paint, you could insert the sharp end of the blades into it. Use some tape or cling wrap to keep the top on the blades.You could also use a paper cup, but it may not last long in a drawer.
How can I keep an office chair cool enough to avoid causing perspiration?
Get up and move. Even if just standing at your desk, you'll get some airflow to cool you and the chair off. Go get some water or something else that can be done quickly. I've never tried the bamboo cover, though they look uncomfortable to me. 
How to signal a person driving behind you to stop texting?
Beep you horn, to get their attention. Your horn is there to make people aware of your presence and if someone is at risk of running into the back of you because they aren't paying enough attention, it's a perfectly legitimate use of the horn.
How to clean dirty white earphones
Just use a little bit of hand sanitizer and keep applying it over the length of the cable over and over again. It has left my earphone cables looking almost new. 
How to signal a person driving behind you to stop texting?
If it's safe to do so, pull over and let them pass.  Do not step on the brake; you'll just collect them on the rear bumper (and suing them afterward usually doesn't make things better).
How to signal a person driving behind you to stop texting?
You might consider installing a rear-facing "dash-cam" to document the condition of following drivers; that way, next time you get rear-ended (inevitable, if you drive in traffic with texters), you'll have the documentation you need to sue them for enough to make the papers -- which might make a difference to everyone affected by this.If you're concerned about privacy (you shouldn't be, when you're trying to protect yourself against the negligence of others), you could install an obvious dummy camera -- perhaps buy an old VHS-C camcorder at a thrift store, or similar.  One that doesn't actually work, but makes it appear that you're recording people (tailgating, texting behind you, etc.).
How can I untie this knot?
Perhaps instead of even just untying the knot in the first place, you could instead use a knife to cut off the knot from the bag itself.
How can I untie this knot?
On the other end of the closure from that in your photo, you can pluck the thread of the last stitch on one side (the "flat" looking side, as I recall) between two points of penetration through the bag and tape.  This will start the stitching unraveling, and all you need to do is keep pulling and the entire closure will come undone.
How to signal a person driving behind you to stop texting?
I've posted this as an answer to a similar question before but it got so many downvotes that I deleted it. Hopefully the OP will find this technique as useful as I have done for the last 30 years. I'm less inclined to delete it again either way.I have mastered the technique of left-foot braking. Most importantly, I am able to make my brake lights activate with virtually no braking action taking place.The offending driver behind you will look up from their phone and expect all to be the same as it was when they looked down, however, in the meantime, you have touched the brake pedal with your left foot. They panic and overreact, you drive on, releasing the brake pedal. After this happens a few times they will realise they aren't able to drive behind you whilst texting.Personally, I've never been concerned about someone rear-ending my car (which has never happened in 30 years I might add), they are implictly in the wrong having done so and it will cost them big money. For this reason, I am happy to use a secondary technique in these situations as well. Having seen my brake lights activated when I am not braking, I then go on to use my handbrake when I AM braking - which slows the car without activating the brakelights at all. The combination of both techniques is incredibly potent when used on people who are not concentrating, they automatically switch to a different driving style where the road becomes the focus of their attention. I have actually seen this happen by watching them in my rear-view mirror, the eyes spend 90% of the time looking out of the car rather than the 10% they were previously giving.
More effective way to clean a CD/DVD?
I have used Turtle Wax car wax on several CDs that were skipping, etc., and it has worked every time.  Of course, these were fairly minor scratches or gunk.  It might not work on really deep scratches. Use it the same way you would on a car.  Apply it with gentle circular motion using damp soft cloth.  Let it dry to a powder.  Wipe clean with dry soft cotton cloth (e.g. undershirt).
Keeping quiet in the kitchen at night while other people sleeping
Walking around the house is probably loudest when placing feet heel-first to the floor. Walking front-first is a lot better (now it depends on the house: on the concrete floor, you should be inaudible, wood might still be problematic).Opening doors: push/pull it shut before pushing down the handle / turning the knob. That way there's no stress on the catch and no sudden bumping when the door is released.Closing doors: the same, turn the knob / push the handle down before closing the door. push/pull it completely shut and keep it there while releasing the knob/handle.I assume you have the kitchen door closed already when pushing the microwave buttons.No good solutions from me for the rest :([EDIT:]okay, no kitchen door. One can buy some folding doors in home improvement stores. I think blocking the direct airway will help. putting furniture in the corridor or plants to dampen the echo would be an addon (ever compared the noise in an empty apartment to how it sounds after moving in?). Though it feels like beeping from the microwave will not be impressed by echo dampers.You can (desperately?) try to find out where the speaker is (like on phones one can drastically reduce the volume by putting the hand on the speaker). If it's accessible you can improvise. Cover the speaker with one hand while pushing the button with the other.
Keeping quiet in the kitchen at night while other people sleeping
I'd suggest ensuring people close their doors while sleeping (they should anyway, for fire safety and privacy), and you may want to install a noise machine in the hallway, or play a CD of surf sounds, rain sounds, or similar when you're up and others are sleeping.For washing hands, you can do that in the kitchen sink, and not have to walk back and forth along the hall.For walking, soft-soled slippers will do a lot to reduce noise.
Keeping quiet in the kitchen at night while other people sleeping
You could try sound proofing the kitchen and wash your hands in the kitchen sink.Sheetrock can be used to sound-proof your kitchen. As pseyfert stated with the folding doors this is indeed a good combo with my answer!
Showering while avoiding patch to get wet
When I had a broken arm I used a plastic bag and tape, afterwards i would use a damp sponge to clean the areas around the cast.I also had a surgery on my right arm and I had to keep the stitches dry. Plastic bag method worked again. After a shower I would remove the bag and  use a sponge to clean more precisely around the area.
How to get fitted sheets on bed?
After some thorough browsing ...Start with the hardest corner to reach and snuggly apply the fitted sheet there. Note: The elastic should rest under the mattress, not on the sideGrab the corner diagonally across from the one you just applied and secure it in placeTuck in the other two cornersTucking in diagonal corners first will help ensure the maximum stress between two points. This serves the purpose of more quickly "telling" you if you've insecurely fastened the first sheet, as well as providing a strong foundation for the process if you've done it correctly.Related tip: Consider making a small mark on the corners of your fitted sheet to help instruct you which corner goes where!Sources:Reddit 1Reddit 2Meta FilterA & M
Keeping quiet in the kitchen at night while other people sleeping
I am in a similar situation at home.  I get up to go to work at around six in the morning whilst my wife and two very young children (2 and newborn) continue to sleep.  If I make too much noise and wake on of the kids, that usually wakes everyone in the house.I find preparation is key, I make sure that I've done as many things the evening before as I can.  Things such as putting clothes out ready so I don't have to open drawers or cupboards.  I find that if I've not done this, the act of looking for something in particular generally creates lots of noise.I walk around the house barefoot or in socks although this does depend on what your flooring is like and how frequently it's cleaned.  I also know where most of the "creaky" bits of floor are and avoid them.With regards to doing things in the kitchen, if I can put as many closed doors as I can between me and those that are sleeping I generally find this works best.A couple of weeks ago I spend an hour or so going around the house with a can of light spray oil (WD-40 specifically, although 3 in 1 or numerous others would do) and lubricated every door hinge, handle and lock mechanism.  You'd be very surprised by the reduction in noise that has made.  Some of the doors which previously creaked are now literally silent in operation.With regards to the appliances.  It may be worth consulting the manufacturers or checking the manuals (usually available online) to see if they can be adjusted to run silently (i.e. without a "beep").  Some may not support this function but hopefully some do.My final piece of advice is to do things slowly.  If I rush, I make noise.  If I do things very slowly and methodically I find I can do them almost silently.
Keeping quiet in the kitchen at night while other people sleeping
if it is your appliance or if they are ok with it, you could removethe bell from the appliances or have a technician do it, is prettysimple.have a pair of slippers in your car or near the door handy when you have to be walking at those times, your own door can be handled by opening /closing it slowly turning the knob completely before open or closing it.

How do I get rid of a particularly disgusting mental image
You need to train your mind in order to control it. This is not easy, and it requires a lot of practice as any physical exercise.A good trick is, when that image/though comes to your mind, you realize and you think "let's move to a different thing" and think in whatever else you want. You can also say it (if you are on your own). Also, you can have a list of nice things to think about it like: what am I going to do this weekend? or what do I want for dinner? and so on.A similar one is set a time in the day to think about that. For example, set 10 minutes in the night to think about it, say at 9.30pm. Then, when this comes to your mind, you think "this is not the time to think about it" and keep postponing it till 9.30pm and you can think about it 10 minutes. Then, reduce the time that you are going to spend thinking about it: from 10 minutes to 8, then 6, 4... when you arrive to the 2 minutes, probably your mind will be trained enough to chose the option of stopping thinking about it.A good way to learn how to control your mind is meditation. Again, this is not easy and it requires practice. Meditation can sound like something empty that is just going to help you to fall sleep if you practice but, actually, the goal is to learn how to control your mind and meditation will help you to be focus in one single thing during a period of time. If you are able to achieve this, you will be controlling your mind and you will be able to apply that lesson to the rest of the aspects in your life. This is an article that explains a bit how to meditate but there are several resources available in Internet that you can try and see which one is better for you, bearing in mind that what you want to achieve is cleaning your mind and to do so, you are going to practice this exercise about focusing :)

How can I keep an office chair cool enough to avoid causing perspiration?
Putting a towel on the chair can be helpful. I use one made of microfiber as it works best for me. Microfiber is especially good at absorbing moisture from both sides, and is often used in sportswear to wick away perspiration.  I recommend it for your application because keeping your chair dry can help it feel cooler.  If you're worried about appearance, microfiber's very thin, and can go unnoticed by co-workers. Even if they see the towel, it tends to be fairly unobtrusive. Since it comes in many colors, you can choose something that closely matches your chair. The material is easy to cut, and doesn't easily fray, so you can size it as you see fit. I keep a number of these towels around the house, as they're good for many things. If you don't happen to have any, they're inexpensive (at least here in Northeast United States), and can be found at a variety of stores.  Best of all, they wash easily and last a very long time. 
If I break a water pipe, is there a way to stop the flow while I go turn off the water?
Install an electrical water valve on the water main coming into your home with a remote switch located some were in your living space, preferably centrally located. If you get a break in line just hit switch and it will shut water off.Now the benefit of doing this is that you can install water sensors in area of your home that might have a line break and cause serious water damage. These sensors will detect leak and will cause electrical water valve to shut off. This comes in handy when you are away. This is a simple installation and you can use low voltage to operate. Now the best water valve to use is a electrical latching water valve, that way if you lose your electrical the water valve will stay close. Better yet use a Hunter Sprinkler NODE100VALVE NODE Single Station Controller with DC Latching Solenoid and PGV-101G valve operate with a 9 volt battery. This is a water sprinkler valve, can easily be modified for as a water line break shut off if a breaks happens. Check it out.  good luck
Throwing away personal memoribilia
Throwing personal items away is not a thing we can do easily as there are  memories involved. With these memories there also is a piece of our own life we may want to keep attached.Exactly this approach is one thing we can use to help u. The question to ask for each item would then be:Do I have a memory with this item?The items were kept by you parents because they had good memories attached to them. It it their life they kept but only a part of it involved your lifes too. If the answer to above question was no then throwing away may have hurt your parents but it will not hurt you.Next approach would be to decide together with your brother. Have a look at each item. Then ask in turn:Do you want this?In case both want to keep it then it is easy. It is a valuable item. If any of you answers with "yes" then give it to whom it wants. If none of you feels like keeping it, just bin it.Last not least a third aspect may come in place which is not so easy to answer. Any item may be of historical genealogy interest. I the item of historical interest?It may not be for any of you at present but there may come a day where you, or one of your own children may get some interest on the roots of their family. This aspect especially includes the diaries and photos of people from your family. It then may not be so much the places that your parents visited but people they had met. Sorting this out needs a lot of time but by keeping all photos showing people and throwing away all photos of places you can't remember helps a lot. You can see there is considerable overlap with the first question for making the decision.
Throwing away personal memoribilia
Start by scanning as much as you can. Digital copies are much easier to store and access allowing you to declutter. Finding a batch scanner is the most efficient method. However, doing it by hand can help you sort through and appreciate each piece as you scan it in. I'm not entirely sure the best way to get access to a batch scanner though - any ideas anyone? DocuFree and Shoeboxed are services that you can mail hardcopies to and they'll scan everything in for you. Next, think about when you might come back to the things you can't scan in. Will you ever go back and look at them, talk about them? Would you come back to them with grand kids to tell stories, show them off? If not, take a picture then toss them. If you could see yourself coming back and looking at it, then consider keeping it. If you want inspiration, in this video Tom Scott burns his beloved hoodie and remembers it only via digital memory, photos. Best of luck!
How do I repair a popped button when not at home?

Reducing the high pitched sound of writing on chalkboard
Apparently, the way you grab the chalk influences in the noise: if you fully grab it, putting your forefinger over it, it will eliminate vibrations. Also, write without making a lot of pressure. Break the chalk in two chunks and write with one of it so the edge is softer.Avoid old chalks as they are harder. And don't put your hand over the chalkboard when writing.If you practice these, the noise will disappear.
How should I keep track of money lent?
For me, when I lend people money, I make a note in my favorite notes app (in this case, Notes since I use an iPhone). Something like name/amount/date.John      $3    08-04-2016.Ezra      $5    11-04-2016Matt      $7    11-04-2016Once it's been returned, I just place a delimiter (in this case a .) at the end of the string. In the example, I've collected $3 from John.I've used this method for about three years now and it's been very effective.names used in the example were randomly selected off the top of my head and did not have the intention of representing any real people.
What is the best way to stop the bleeding from a shaving cut?
The simplest way to stop bleeding from a minor cut like a shaving nick is to apply direct pressure (a clean fingertip does the job nicely) for at least two minutes.If you take blood thinners or have a low-grade clotting disorder, it might take ten to thirty minutes or more for clotting to occur, and the time must be restarted if you remove the pressure and bleeding restarts.  If you have full-blown hemophilia, you shouldn't be shaving at all, by any method (even an electric razor can skim off raised skin around a follicle and cause bleeding), though your doctor may suggest a trimmer with a suitable guard to control beard length.Obviously, if you have to hold pressure for ten minutes or more to stop bleeding, you'll need to reapply your choice of shaving foam or soap before you can finish shaving, but if that applies to you, you should consider shaving by a method less likely to cause bleeding, such as an electric foil shaver.
How can I turn an echoey alcove into a home office suitable for video & audio calls?
I'll assume the camera is directly in front of you.  Position a floor lamp with a transparent/translucent white lampshade a few feet to the left of it, and a foot or two above it.  If the light is too straight-on your face will look flat on camera. Since the light will make the lampshade "glow", the light will be softer (instead of a stark bare bulb that casts crisp shadows).  The white walls will also reflect light onto the rest of you, making it look softer but still directional.  If you want a little more punchy lighting, you could also place a lamp with a bare bulb directly to your right and even a little bit behind you. (I've been making and lighting videos for 10 years.)Get a phone headset.  That should eliminate most of the room noise, since the mic will be very close to your mouth.  DO NOT use speaker phone; that mic would always be too far from your mouth and will pick up way too much room noise and echo.Behind you, just place a book case that contrasts with the walls (so a darker color) and put a plant on it, off center.  For more interest you could place the dark book case with the plant on it off to one side of the video frame, and have a similarly-colored or complimentary-colored chair on the other side of the video frame. Asymmetry with balance is always pleasant to look at, but you don't want your background to be distracting.
How should I keep track of money lent?
(This is a modification of the great answer already provided by @perhapsmaybeharry.)Keep a reverse-chronological list in your favorite app on your phone.  When someone pays you back, add the date that they paid you back, and move them down to the section of "completed debts". "Active debts" stay at the top.  Something like thisMatt      $2    4/11/2016Karen     $5    4/4/2016John      $3    4/5/2016 4/6/2016Matt      $7    4/1/2016 4/10/2016Keeping a history, and noting when people pay you back, lets you see how long each person takes to pay you back, in case you're interested later on. For example, Matt took 9 days to pay you back, but John paid you back the next day. Also, Matt has borrowed money twice recently. (I'm not sure how I feel about Matt....)
How to signal a person driving behind you to stop texting?
I don't like to spend too much time looking in my rearview mirror instead of looking ahead, so here's what I do:- If I'm concerned about safety, I pull over at the first, safe opportunity to let the driver around me. I don't have the authority of law enforcement, so I cannot educate anyone. All I can do is create a safe space where/when possible.- If I can't pull over, I put on my flashing emergency lights. This works in all cases. I've never had it fail. Hand signals can be misunderstood. Same goes for horns. I tap my horn to alert someone if they can go ahead of me (simple communication), if they are getting too close to me and I can't move (informative alert), and (rarely) lay on my horn to communicate a serious danger. That doesn't mean I don't get angry, but drivers have rudimentary tools to communicate and the law dictates how we can respond, so I have to manage my emotions on the road. I will say, pulling over or choosing to back off and calm down, provides near-immediate relief from stress. I've never regretted making the safer choice. I drive, for the most part, happy and chilled out because of it. I've lived in 6 states, one territory, done two cross-country trips, and driven a 36-state loop. I've seen all manner of behavior and weather conditions and terrains, and it's best to just be happy, hang back, watch the traffic patterns, help when you can, don't get too riled, and kindly use those emergency flashers to communicate to those behind you to pay attention or watch out. We have to share the road - people have varying degrees of maturity and problem-solving skills. We don't just carry our cargo (kids, groceries, work stuff), we are also carrying the stresses of the day. So it's basically a crapshoot. You just do the best you can. Be safe. Make it home to the family who loves you. We have to look out for each other. 
How to signal a person driving behind you to stop texting?
Someone mentioned posting a sign. Reminded me of something I tried. I used to commute GA-400 into Atlanta, in the slow lane, going 10 mph over the speed limit, and I would still get tailed by a speeder. I've even had someone honk his horn and shake his fist because I wasn't going 20mph over the speed limit in the fast lane. I always used my commute to learn something about people-dynamics. And I'd brainstorm about the "perfect bumper sticker" that would resolve situations. So I came up with a 70-point (homemade, pre Cafe Press days) bumper sticker that said Why Hurray?I slapped that on with some clear packing tape. It worked beautifully. I couldn't count the number of cars that would come screaming up behind me, zoom in tight, then read the sticker, back way off, sometimes going around me. I don't think it ticked anyone off. I think it just gave them pause to think, and also to know that I was going as fast as I was going and it was futile to push, as I chose not to hurry.I learned a few other fun things, too:Driver's are trained to be defensive. And that's fine. But when we take it too far we miss out on little opportunities to help one another. Not a big deal, just something I noticed. For instance, most drivers wait to put on turn signals to change lanes because they believe that the car in that lane will close the gap. They believe this because it happens. So they wait to signal because they don't want to trigger defensive behavior that will cause them to lose the opportunity to move over. I tested that theory in moderate commuter traffic. Every time I signaled in advance, the car in the lane I wanted sped up and closed the gap. But, and this is what makes it all worthwhile, when I kept the signal on, and didn't hug the dotted line or do anything else aggressive, just cruised a long in my lane, my signal became more like a request. The driver perceived that I was asking with that signal, instead of demanding, and the driver (in all cases) backed off and kindly let me in. So even the people who come off as rude aren't really rude after all. At least that's my takeaway. 
How can I turn an echoey alcove into a home office suitable for video & audio calls?
When you're thinking about outfitting a home office, making that space suitable for audio and video calls is a multi-step process. You need to make sure that you hear the caller, that you are heard clearly, and that your environment is reasonably well-lit.How do you sound?You would prefer if people didn't hear everything in your environment, so investing in an expensive headset or microphone with noise-canceling features will help.Making yourself sound less echo-ey is surprisingly easy: muffle the ambient noise slightly. For most spaces this involves both carpeting the floor or putting an area rug in place, or using a sound baffle to speak into so that the noise doesn't bounce as much.You may also experiment with using different input than your laptop microphone, which tends to pick up things like typing and doesn't have much of a filter. Consider using a USB microphone or another plug-in source that is hidden from the screen when you're talking. You may not need a boom mic, but either a headset or a simple plug-in microphone will help. Test this set up by recording a standard script and then playing it back so that you can hear how scratchy (or blissfully quiet) things sound in your environment.Note: changing how you sound is different than noise-canceling headphones, which do a great job of smoothing out the noise you hear from other people and do not change the sound those people hear at all.How well do I hear them?This is the easiest part of the problem - making sure you are able to hear your caller well. A basic headset will help - if you use an Apple device, the stock headphones work surprisingly well, or a headsets from Logitech are a good bet. You don't need super fancy, just comfortable.If you use a headset intended for headphone and microphone jacks and you only have USB or a USB Hub, buy a USB sound adapter.Does the environment look ok?When you are on a video call, you'll need the background to be simple and avoid distraction. A complicated solution might be a video backdrop and a stand; while a simple solution might be a neutral colored bedsheet that you hang on your wall so that you avoid displaying the contents of your alcove on a remote call.Not every video call is made equal - for example, Zoom will have different results from GoToMeeting or Google Hangouts. You'll need to experiment to find the best combination.Tune your networkThis part might be obvious, and it's worth upgrading your network equipment so you get the most out of the internet connection you have. Apple and eero both have excellent routers that make sure you are not dropping packets.
How to repair synthetic nylon pouch
I think there is two ways you can fix this.1) Cut a piece of material slightly bigger than the hole in the mesh and stick it with a strong glue... i.e. open the pocket, put your hand in it with a piece of wood with the material being on the wood. With your other hand, take another piece of flat wood and push them together. Hopefully that does the job as the material should prevent future rips in the materials.2) Sewing... try to sow the rips together, pulling the thread through the opposite sides of the rip, going all the way around. The problem with this is that you will end up with a thick line (one you complete the fix), but it will do the job if done correctly.Either way, this is a hard fix as you will be able to see were the rip has happened in the past.
How can I shower without a towel?
Years ago I was in some touristy gift shop and saw an "Authentic American Indian Towel".  It was basically just a slat of wood that was (presumably) used by Native Americans to "flick" the standing water off of their skin since they (again, presumably) had no towels.Whether something like this was really used or the story was fabricated for gullible tourists I have no idea, but it does work.  If you're in a situation where you have no towel, just grab a ruler on your way to the shower.  Scrape and flick, and you'll be reasonably dry.
How to open oysters safe without oyster knife & glove?
What I have seen is people somehow put the oyster on a surface with the side opposite the hinge hanging off the edge. Something like an oyster block would also work. You then hold it tightly and use a small hammer or some sort of hard object to break the edge of the shell. Once there is a hole at the end, you can then use a flat instrument to cut the adducter muscle from the top and bottom of the shell. However, this method can create many little pieces of shell that may be unappetizing or even dangerous to your teeth. I prefer using an oyster knife and a towel. I have some nice scars from the slips.
What is the best way to stop the bleeding from a shaving cut?
These are 5 alternatives to toilet paper:1. DeodorantMost antiperspirants contain aluminum chloride that can, in addition to shrinking sweat glands, constrict blood vessels and clot a nick.2. Lip BalmSmearing on a little ChapStick or Vaseline works like a seal—plus it’ll keep bigger cuts from forming unsightly scabs.3. Ice CubesLike swimming pools and your package, the cold shrinks blood vessels, enabling a clot to form fast.4. MouthwashThe alcohol in solutions like Listerine acts as an astringent, which halts blood flow by causing tissues to contract.5. Eye DropsRed eye relievers like Visine work similarly on cuts: they slow down bleeding by constricting blood vessels

If you can put signs up and inform people that you are doing this it may make kids think twice or go elsewhere.
How to clean transparent silicone/jelly cases?
Some phone cases leave marks or small scratches on the phone. If this happens, take the cover off and use a microfiber cloth to rub the phone well. If scratches are still visible, apply some denatured alcohol to the microfiber cloth and rub the phone again.If your phone is significantly damaged by the case and you have an iPhone and have only ever used the original Apple phone case, consider taking the phone and case into the Apple store. Show them the marks and scratches on your phone and see what they will do for you.If you have only mild stains or your case is dirty with dust and grime, then all it needs is a good wash. Grab a small bowl and fill it with warm water and dish soap. Use a toothbrush or similar gentle brush to scrub the dirty or mildly stained areas. This solution is great for giving your case a quick clean. It will look good as new.Another alternative:Fill a large bowl with warm water. Add about a tablespoon dish soap, or citrus-based cleaner. Place something heavy on your case to keep it submerged and let it sit for a few minutes. Use a soft brush to gently scrub to remove stains or dirt. Repeat as needed and rinse with cold water. Make sure to dry your case well before installing back onto your iPhone.

Inhaling less chalk dust while erasing blackboard during teaching
Tie a handkerchief on your nose and mouth while erasing it, to reduce the amount inhaled. (Perhaps the worst option, I mean, seriously ...!!!)This could actually be the best idea! Get something cool / funny / trendy with the class demographic, and make a brief 'show' of donning the handkerchief and wiping the blackboard. The students might actually become more engaged!You could go with a gator, maybe a ninja, a monkey, a superhero or any number of other things.*edit: I'm not affiliated with that last link in any way - it as just the first result i found on google!

How to find a mosquito at night?
Why to allow mosquitoes in the room at first place?Prevent them from coming inside the room.Using mosquito net allows air to flow as well as blocks mosquitoes.If u are sticking to searching mosquito in dark then best solution would be to use 9V 6f22 battery connected to 2 x 4.5 volt LEDs. (Unlike 3 V led, These LEDs spread light instead of concentrating it.) Place it such that light will fall on mosquitoes and reflect back to you. Reason to use led than simply turning light on is that, led do not light walls to much extent as they are far than mosquitoes and thus mosquitoes are easily seen.By this you can easily spot and kill mosquitoes.

How to find a mosquito at night?
I usually turn on the lights in a different but small room (for example the bathroom) while keeping the lights of every other room switched off. It won't need more than 3 minutes for the mosquito to be inside. Once it's inside, close the door to trap it in this room and either leave it there or exterminate it. 
How to find a mosquito at night?
When you've switched on the lights, be patient. The mosquito will fly to a place where it's visible eventually. When you're hunting the mosquito, make sure not to cast a shadow on the mosquito. The sudden shadow will make the mosquito fly away. 
Stepped in a puddle before a meeting. How to dry a sock quickly?
I ended up microwaving the sock in the office break room because I only had a few minutes before a meeting to get it dry. Here's what worked:Take off the cotton sock and ring it out well. Put the sock in the shape of a ring on a microwavable plate for max surface area.Put paper towels over it and under it like a sandwich.Microwave on high (900W) for about 1 minute.Flip the paper-towel-sock sandwich over and replace the wet paper towels (now the top ones) with fresh paper towels, and let the steam out of the microwave. The sock will be hot(!) but it cools in about 10 seconds.Repeat step #5 4 or 5 times until the sock is dry or just lightly damp.  It was a cotton sock (not synthetic) so I think it shrunk a little, but it cooled quickly and I could wear it. Again, with only a few minutes to get the sock dry before a meeting, this worked well in a pinch.
How do I avoid ants from eating up all my sweets?
What I do is hang/hook the sweets I bring home on a rope, in a polyethene wrap. In that way ants don't get to it as it doesn't touch the ground, and you can enjoy your sweets.P.S.- You're unlucky if the ants found the rope.
How do I avoid ants from eating up all my sweets?
Here is a list of things you could do:1. Deterrence The best way to get rid of ants is to prevent them from ever considering your home an easy target. Ants are tiny, and can find thousands of doorways that you didn’t even know about. But as much as you can, block those entryways.2. Caulk Continuing on this theme, try sealing with caulk any windows, doors and any cracks the ants crawl through. This will also give you better temperature control and lower energy bills, and is one of the least risky methods if you have kids or pets.3. Vinegar Clean surfaces in your home with a half-and-half solution of white distilled vinegar and water. As an added bonus, this is a great mixture to use for cleaning in general, replacing detergents with polluting phosphorus. Vinegar works because ants hate its smell, and the vinegar removes the scent trails they use to get around.4. Lemon Juice Just like vinegar, lemon juice also seems to destroy those scent trails that ants follow. Try spraying lemon juice around the places you think ants are using for entryways.5. Peppermint Oil Here’s another super-easy one to try. Clean off your surfaces really well, and then wipe them down with a clean damp cloth that has a few drops of essential peppermint oil on it. Ants seem to really dislike the smell of it and it is also environmentally friendly, and safe for humans and children. Not to mention, your kitchen will smell minty fresh.6. Spices and Herbs Another deterrent to make your home smell awesome! Sprinkle black pepper, cayenne pepper, chili pepper, cinnamon, mint, chili pepper, cloves or garlic (whichever you have at hand) wherever you’ve seen ants and along your home’s foundation. You can also try placing bay leaves in cabinets, drawers and containers.7. Coffee Grounds Sprinkle your used coffee grounds in the garden and around the outside of your house. If you can locate exactly where the ants are getting in, be sure to put some there. You should see them move away from your home because they dislike the smell of coffee grounds.8. Chalk and Baby Powder Try drawing a line of chalk or sprinkle baby powder across the spot where the ants are entering your home. It works because talcum powder, an ingredient in both chalk and baby powder, is a natural ant repellent.9. Cucumber or Citrus Peels You can repel those ants by leaving these peelings in areas of known ant activity. That’s because cucumber and citrus peels are toxic to the types of fungi that ants feed on, so they don’t want to go anywhere near them.10. Dish Soap Put a very thin line of dish soap around baseboards, windows, doors and wherever else the ants tend to gather. You can also try pouring dish soap directly onto ant hills or mix the soap with some water in a spray bottle.Information: Reference

Glass photo Adhesive suggestion
Most adhesives will yellow with age and sun exposure, but the glass provides better protection for the actual image compared to putting it on the viewer side.  One method that has a good history is a decoupage liquid, available in craft stores.  Look for a kind marked "dries clear, stays clear" or similar; some cloud a bit, others can yellow or cloud with time.  Generally, the best are the urethane based versions.You might also check at home improvement or hardware stores for urethane varnish products; these are essentially the same material, only packaged for application to bare wood.  General application method is to apply a thin, even layer to the glass, wait a bit for the brush marks to self-level, then apply the picture like a decal (curve it a bit, set the center down, then work gradually outward with a plastic paddle or spatula to seat the entire item into the coating and push bubbles out).  Once the entire item is adhered, follow package direction for recoating to apply at least one additional coat over the item.You may also need to apply an opaque sheet behind the photo to prevent backlight from showing text from the back of the photo through the image -- this will be worse after application, because the coating will usually make the paper more transparent than it was.Anything applied to glass has a tendency to peel; there's no real way around this if the glass is polished (as window glass and similar are).  If the glass is frosted, the coating will adhere better, but it'll be nearly impossible to fill in the frosting texture completely enough to restore transparency, due to the viscosity of the coating.
Glass photo Adhesive suggestion
Spray mount adhesive may do the job. I would recommend trying it with something other than the photo you want to mount first. If it doesn't work satisfactorily, the glass should be easy enough to clean afterwards.

How do I manage my cat food in the absence of maid?
You need to contact and trust one of your neighbours to feed the cat unless you can't take a break and come from work to do it.
Glass photo Adhesive suggestion
A very similar technique can be used for displaying your photos on glass. You need a toner-based print of your photo (e.g. using a copier or laser printer) and some clear contact paper.Sticking the contact paper to your print will transfer the toner from your ordinary paper to the sticky transparent film. The next step is to soak the two connected sheets in water, which softens up the white paper and allows it to be rubbed off. What you’re left with is a piece of wet transparent contact paper that features your photo. Let it dry to restore its stickiness, and then attach the resulting “sticker” to whatever you’d like to show off your photo on (e.g. glass jars, candle holders, windows etc.)

How to make custom colored paper
You can create colored paper pulp by running colored craft paper through a blender. An alternative is to add food color or paint (or tea, or any other stain or coloring agent) to white paper pulp. Once you have several jars with different colored pulps, you can then blend those colors together to make the color you desire to use in your paper. The final color of the pulp will shift slightly as it dries when you make the paper, sort of like the shift in color between wet and dry paint. Some practice is needed to get the precise final color you desire.The following video shows how to mix colored paperpulp when making paper:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCjLGX6W48Q

How to make custom colored paper
I have dyed fabric before, using store-bought fabric dyes.  I imagine you could immerse a sheet of paper in a bath of fabric dye for a minute, then let it "drip dry" by hanging it (with an old towel underneath to catch the drips!!), and finally iron it with a cool iron to keep the paper flat. You As with Mark Ripley's earlier answer, you would need to experiment with mixing fabric dyes together to get the colors you want -- but you would have a LOT of control over the colors you end up with! And obviously you can experiment with postage-stamp sized swatches of the paper that you'll ultimately use.
How do I avoid ants from eating up all my sweets?
Ants are some of the most amazing creatures on Earth! Ant I find them maddening! I'm afraid, as good as the idea of hanging your sweets from a rope is, that it is simply not going to be sufficient. Ants can crawl up walls and across ceilings. They'll get to the rope... I've even had them come in through my back door and make trails under my living room carpet, the go under the baseboards to get to the kitchen! Ants send out "scout ants" when they are hunting for food. One of three things will happen. If the ant returns home with food s/he lays down that well known chemical trail to tell the rest of the ants in the "hill" where the food was found so others can follow the path of the chemical. However, if the ant does not find food, it somehow (possibly a different chemical, not sure exactly) lets other ants know not to go that way, as there is no food to be found. But thirdly, the last outcome is that if the ant fails to return "home" (mostly likely because s/he's died), the ants will also not go "there", so to speak. So...your NUMBER one line of defense should be to be SURE that ALL SURFACES in ALL food areas (ANYWHERE food is prepared, kept, OR EATEN (dining table, desk tops, furniture)) are kept not just wiped down with a paper towel for crumb collections, but TRULY cleaned to erase ALL food particles AND traces! Many people think that if they use the kitchen sponge to wipe down the kitchen counter top that that will be sufficient. But most people don't properly/sufficiently rinse/wash their sponges or clothes that they use after wiping down counter tops and stove tops. ANY trace of food scent or particle left on whatever is being used to wipe up surfaces that was previously used to do the same is simply spreading a trail of yummies, so to speak, that will attract ants. It does NOT have to be something YOU can see! During the spring/summer months I will about once a week soak my kitchen sponge in a solution of water and apple cider vinegar. Just a small bowl of water big enough to hold the sponge or dish cloth with about 2-3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar will do a fantastic job of removing bacteria and viruses as well as removing the scent of food, and will leave the sponge smelling clean and fresh. I usually let mine soak over night and then rinse well the next morning. The other alternative is to put the sponge in the dishwasher when you run it and pour in about 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar into the bottom of the dishwasher. It'll clean the sponge as above and help keep the dishwasher clean to. That to could be done weekly. Keeping ants out is again, ALL about keeping things REALLY clean. Keep floors vacuumed and swept, daily if necessary. Second line of defense is going to be to keep ALL foods (including pet foods (pet food bowls cleaned too daily)) properly contained. My dog tends to eat half his food at a time (no matter how much I give him). If he fails to eat his food fast enough, it draws the ants. If there's anything but dry food in the bowl, I have to wash the bowl when he's done, or I get ants. Spilled kibble on the floor draws them. I leave my butter out on the counter, I like it soft. One year, the ants ate right through the wax paper wrapper! There were LITERALLY HOLES in the paper! So bottom line, keep EVERYTHING spotless, crazy CLEAN and keep your sweets in an air tight container, maybe even refrigerated, and you MIGHT not have an influx of ants! I deal with them every year to some degree or another. I found three today. So, the fight is on. I wish you (and your sweets) much luck against the ants!

How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
Use 12 alarm clocks, each one ringing 5 seconds after the previous one, and each one being further away than the last. This way, you would have to get up, walk over, shut off, go to bed, immediately get up, walk over, shut off, go to bed, immediately get up, walk over, shut off, etc. until you get to the point where the next one rings before you even get to bed and before you know it you're up.
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
I'd suggest seeing a doctor to be evaluated for depression.  Depression can change your sleep patterns and make it very difficult, even if fully awake, to get out of bed.  It can also masquerade as sleep deprivation, or vice versa, and have other physical symptoms.No, not really a lifehack, but there's no lifehack that will solve your problem if you're so depressed you just go back to bed no matter how hard you have to work to shut off the alarm.Alternatively, if you're medically certain that depression isn't the cause, you might explore hypnosis.  It's very commonly used to overcome bad habits.
Way to carry a wedding band on your person when it's not on your finger
The only viable option is to use (water resistant) tape. Wrap it around your arm and put the wedding band under it. It's even safer if you wrap it twice and put the band in between the two layers. This will probably work well but it's a bit uncomfortable.

Presuming you have a safe place already to store things like ID, credit cards, and cell phone, it seems like the sensible thing to do is to leave your ring there, perhaps in an inner pocket of your wallet.
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
Obviously you do wake up and you are already in such a good shape that you manage to hit the snooze button (and not the finally-off button). So you might also realize that there is not yet an absolute need to get up immediately but you can post-pone this to some minutes later without much of a risk.So that exactly is where your issue is. You need to pull yourself together to  get up. Being sleepy is extremely counter-productive here.What worked for me is to introduce an urgent need to get up right now, not a minute or two later. This can be achieved with two easy hacks:Set the alarm to the latest possible time when you really really need to get up to just about make it to get to work in time. You know you will be late if you had pressed on snooze only once.Do not use an alarm with a snooze button. You will then know that you will oversleep if you turn it off. This alone will help you a lot to actually get up, and not to go back to bed again.Of course, if we are lucky, we can try to slowly re-adjust our sleep/wake cycle by getting to bed earlier. This can not be done with one or two tries but it needs several days if not weeks. It then may help to better wake up in the morning but it is at the cost of losing all our evenings (which was the main reason it did not work out for me).
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
Is there any good way to get rid of this habit?Disable the snooze function. On some high-end alarms (and several smartphone apps) this is possible.On most alarms, there is a dedicated button with a snooze function. A judicious application of Superglue will prevent the snooze button from ever working again. I'd recommend several very small applications leaving time for the glue to cure, to prevent Superglue from leaking into the clock's innards.If it is a touch button or the button is flush and waterproof, you can find some rigid, flat object (e.g. a coin) that can be glued over it to prevent it from being activated. This has the advantage that the function can be restored afterwards.Update: I have a Fitbit Flex thingy that can be set to vibrate on your wrist at a set time. It hasn't a snooze function and turning it off is next to impossible if it's inside a cloth bracelet. Any reprogramming requires flipping out a Bluetooth smartphone. If you're sensitive to a buzzer next to your skin, that might be an option. Of course you need to sleep with the thing on, which might not be everyone's cup of tea.
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
If you use a real alarm clock, open it up and remove the snooze button, covering up the hole so you don't stick your fingers inside or press the remaining button.  The temptation to silence it instead must be resisted - probably by having the clock well away from the bed.If you use an alarm app on your phone, replace the stock one with an app that doesn't have a snooze, or one that makes you do something significant to silence it.  Here's an old list of such apps; some make you walk around before they'll shut up, others just allow you to disable the snooze.Some people swear by "dawn alarm clocks" that increase the brightness of a lamp before sounding the alarm.  The only one I have any experience of was overpriced junk -- not even reliable.Whatever approach you take, you should regard it as training.  So when your no-snooze alarm goes off, you get out of bed and get moving.  Leave the room if possible perhaps a second alarm in another room (battery powered in the bathroom) would get you moving.  Do not even sit on the bed (e.g. to dress) until the evening.

How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
Check emails and / or Facebook as soon as the alarm rings. We all have an urge to read the unread messages or look for notifications. This makes you read. Once you read, your mind wakes up... And it seems boring to go back to sleep as the mind is already awake and you can't sleep again, but just lying with eyes closed. Eventually, you just want to leave the bed and there is no point hitting snooze.I always keep the laptop on and earphones plugged in. It distracts me from thinking about unnecessary things and go to sleep. When I want to wake up after the alarm rings, I check Facebook and emails.
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
Put the alarm clock on the other side of the room so you have to physically get up out of bed and turn it off.If the device you use for an alarm clock supports multiple alarms also set another alarm to go off at one minute after the main target time so if you do just turn it off and go back to bed you will have to get up again more or less straightaway.
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?

Move the alarm clock across the room.  When I physically have to get out of bed I am better about not falling back asleep.Alternatively, feed a cat/dog/fish/velociraptor first thing in the morning.  They like schedules as well, so it makes sense.
Cut a paving slab easily?
A heavy hammer (3-4 lb head) and a broad cold chisel are the only really sensible way to cut a stone that heavy, short of industrial tools, and I don't know that I'd call them specialized -- but you can buy them cheaply at an import tool store or home improvement "big box".  The only practical alternative is a saw or angle grinder with a carbide or diamond wheel mounted, and this is much noisier and more expensive, not to mention a dry saw produces huge volumes of dust you shouldn't inhale.To cut, just use the hammer and chisel to score a line a few millimeters deep where you want the cut, then put a rod (shovel handle works) under the cut line, and stand with your feet on either side of the cut line, as far from the line as the stone will allow.  If necessary, have a helper tap near your feet with the hammer, or stike the chisel in the precut groove.  The stone will break pretty cleanly at the scored line, and you can clean up any remaining irregularities easily with the chisel.

How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
The goal here is to make yourself wake up before you can turn off the alarm. There are a lot of ways to do that, one of which has already been suggested.Move the alarm clock across the room. This is simple but may not be effective enough for you.Buy a new alarm clock with an annoyance feature built in. There are alarm clocks that require you shoot a target, find a tiny drone it just fired, or find the entire clock which has rolled off somewhere. This option will cost you money but it will also ensure there's a delay between the alarm going off and you being able to hit snooze.Build / buy a small box with plenty of holes to let out the noise. Put the alarm clock in the box and lock it shut, adding a clasp and padlock if the box doesn't have a lock. Put the key somewhere else like another room.If you shower in the morning, put the alarm clock in your bathroom. You might decide that it's easier to get into the shower than back to bed as the shower is so close and hot water would be so nice right now.
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
in a comment you mentioned that your girlfriend might want to sleep in longer than you, this could be part of the problem, if she sleeps in longer she may want to stay up later and counteract you trying to get to bed on time and waking up on time, thus the snooze button.if you get up together than it is going to be easier for both of you to get on schedule, and probably help other aspects of your life together as well.there are a lot of things in life that are easier to accomplish when you do them with other people, this is one of those things.another thing is that you need to be excited to get up, excited for the day.  look forward to getting up in the morning. look forward to a new day.  these things will help you get out of the habit of using the snooze button, and may help you get to the point where your body wakes you after it has enough sleep without the need for the alarm clock.
Way to carry a wedding band on your person when it's not on your finger
Get a very small S-biner. Attach it somewhere on your person, and attach your wedding band to the other side as needed. Shown below is a picture of this on a belt loop, holding keys instead of a wedding band. This should be quite secure, especially with the "locking" S-biner shown. If all you have is a bathing suit drawstring, you can tie it on to half of the biner, and clip on the ring when needed.
How can I safely destroy a hard disk?
Hard disks/drives have platters inside of them on which data is stored. Destroying these platters is all you need to do to make the data unrecoverable. These platters are generally made from aluminum, ceramic or glass. Shattering them by smashing them with a hammer, or throwing them against the wall will do the trick most of the time, but the FBI has been known to recover data by painstakingly rebuilding the disks and piecing together data they can extract from it, so if you really want to be sure of it being gone, make a nice hot fire and toss the hard drive into it to melt the platters into something completely unsalvageable. Note: when burning stuff, especially stuff not generally meant to be burned, you should be extremely careful that nothing explodes, and that the fire does not spread to places you do not want the fire going.
How can I safely destroy a hard disk?
If you don't want to burn it, or don't have a fireplace that can contain a fire. Another way of rendering it useless is using acid. Hydrofluoric acid can burn through glass, some ceramics, and reacts with metals, so it should do the trick to destroy it, however it is extremely dangerous to handle, as it is a "contact-poison that causes deep, initially painless burns which result in permanent tissue death. It also interferes with calcium metabolism, which means that exposure to it can and does cause cardiac arrest (heart attack) and death.  Contact with as little as 160 square centimeters (25 square inches) of skin can kill – that’s about the area of the palm of your hand" (source).

If you don't like extreme measures, and just want to protect it against the average Joe, simply open the hard disk with a screw driver and mash the disks with a hammer or some other similar object. Once broken/damaged, not many people will have the time, nor the means to extract any data from it.
How can I safely destroy a hard disk?
Chances are that you do not want to "destroy the hard disk" but simply "be sure it cannot be read".Now you've probably heard that deleting files or formatting the disk is not enough to prevent data recovery. You may even have heard that there are techniques capable of reading the content of a completely overwritten disk.The first is true: deletion and formatting is almost always just a marking of the space as available, but the contents is not lost and can be "undeleted", or recovered almost in its entirety.Recovering overwritten data on the other hand requires significant means, a long time, and costs lots of money. It's also highly likely that it would not work (or cost even more) on modern hard disks where data is more tightly packed, redundancy is lower, and microscopic examination proportionally more difficult. Also, a modern hard disk is orders of magnitude larger than the first models where tunnel  microscopy recovery was demonstrated feasible, which makes data recovery a seek for a much stealthier needle inside a much larger haystack. It would only be conceivable for government-level operations (think San Bernardino iPhone unlocking). Is this really a plausible threat scenario for you?If it is not, then simple overwriting should be enough. Just grab a DiskEraser boot CD, or SafeDelete, or any of several such utilities. You plug the CD in the drive, boot from it, answer a couple of questions and let the utility chug along, overwriting some hundred gigabytes per hour or more depending on disk and CPU.Pros: while the disk is not "as new", it is possibly still useable - saleable, even. Any replaced obsoleted PC is still in working condition. Both the PC and the hard disk can be used for something else (if the disk has still a reasonable life expectancy, it can e.g. be placed in an external USB enclosure and used for backups).Cons: much slower than e.g. driving a large iron spike through the magnetic data platters. But if you have several PCs to get rid of, you can let them go in parallel. Two minutes to boot each, two hours erasure, and in three hours you have zapped twelve machines, which works up to a quarter hour per machine; more or less the same time it takes to physically extract each hard disk and subject it to the Van Helsing decommissioning.
How can I boost my wifi range?
If you don't have foil or if that doesn't work (for the asker or anyone looking here for an answer), I recommend a jug of water. I know from experience that the water amplifies the signal well, and should work in your case. Try a two liter (or 1 gallon) jug filled with plain tap water, and place it next to the router. It may not seem like much, but the water molecules amplify the signal of the Wi-Fi. I currently have this setup to increase the range to an upstairs room in my house, and devices receive Wi-Fi where they didn't before. 
How can I safely destroy a hard disk?
There are powerful rare-earth magnets in most disk drives, so simply unscrew the case and salvage the magnets. Merely removing or even touching the platter will probably make it unreadable, due to contamination from dust and hands, but if you want to ensure a thorough job, pass one of those magnets along the surface. The platter also makes a decent first-surface mirror.
Cut a paving slab easily?
If the material is too thick for Zeiss' method (which works really well), you can move up to the next level of cutting/breaking rock. You will need an impact hammer, a sledge hammer (or other very heavy headed hammer), and some metal wedges (steel works best).Using the impact hammer, drill holes along the axis of where you want the rock to break. The depth of the holes will depend on the material you are separating, and other factors, like how much of the rock is covered or buried. After drilling the holes, insert two wedges against the side of the holes. Insert a third wedge between them. Striking the third wedge into the rock will start a crack formation. Repeat in the other hole.This method should work well for most large garden sized rocks. This method is not good for very small rocks (maybe less than a 1 inch (~2 centimeters) diameter).Here's a video demonstrating this method. Wikipedia also has a much more detailed description of the process with pictures.Plug and feather, also known as plugs and wedges, feather and wedges, wedges and shims, pins and feathers and feather and tare, refers to a technique and a three-piece tool set used to split stone.
How can I safely destroy a hard disk?
In a company i worked, we used a Drilling Machine. Works pretty well.
Cut a paving slab easily?
An angle grinder with a cutting wheel works, and is less likely to break the slab than the hammer and chisel method. 
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
The method that I used to break my addition to the snooze function was to set two alarms. The first would be appropriate for the entire household to hear, such as the default phone alarm. The second alarm was set to be something very embarrassing that I did not want others to hear. This way, I would be forced to get up and disable the alarms, lest the second alarm go off and my children hear the terrible soundtrack (NSFW) that I put on the second alarm.The OP mentions that other people live in the house, namely his grilfriend. So the linked soundtrack may or may not be appropriate, but a creative person could always find other things which should not be heard (NSFW).
How can I safely destroy a hard disk?
There are a few reasonable ways to do this.Destroying the plattersHard drives work by using magnetized platters. The easiest way to destroy these would be to simply open the hard drive casing (often doable with nearby screwdrivers) and pour something like sand into the case. Often, just opening the case and getting dust on the platters will ruin them, but I assume you want to be extra sure. You could also use sandpaper to fully destroy the platter.Destroying the dataAlternatively, you can destroy the data by using something like Darik's Boot 'n Nuke, this will repeatedly write over each byte to the point where data cannot be recovered, but the drive is still usable. This is my preferred method, but be very careful with DBAN - If you accidentally nuke the wrong drive, that data is gone. I would advise dedicating a machine to nuking disks so every disk attached can be safely destroyed.
How to not forget the washed clothes in the washing machine
Similar to Roberts answer, most people walk around with their phone these days - Simply set a timer on your phone. Even if it isn't on you, it can usually be heard around the house assuming the volume is set to high.
How can I safely destroy a hard disk?
I drive a 4" nail through the casing, near the motor. With a hammer and a bit of wood under the drive, it's easy. No need to open the case.If you have a nail gun, it is perfectly capable of driving nails into a hard drive platter (source).
How can I safely destroy a hard disk?
Simpler than some of the other methods, but more secure and reliable than the simpler methods, is to disassemble the drive (as explained in other answers), then use abrasives, i.e. sandpaper or similar, to remove the magnetic coating from the platters.  The material of the platters themselves, whether glass, ceramic, or aluminum, is non-magnetic (it has to be, or it would interfere with data storage in the coating).  So, no coating, no data.  Done!
What is the best way to stop the bleeding from a shaving cut?
You can buy an Alum shaving block. These are very cheap, and when you make them wet, and then rub them (softly) over the cut, the alum will make it close.I use one when shaving with a cut-throat razor. Not necessarily because of cuts, but it also helps with irritation I find.
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
My personal method is not to use a traditional alarm clock. They are typically not very configurable at all. Instead I use my android smartphone's alarm.It gives me the option to enable or disable the snooze feature for each alarm: my morning alarm has it disabled. You can also set a limit to the number of snoozes, and set the length of the snoozes, etc. So if you wanted to set your alarm for 15 minutes earlier, to allow yourself a single snooze of 15 minutes (9 minutes has never felt like the right length for me, but all alarm clocks use it!), you could.It also has the feature to require me to solve a simple puzzle before turning off: press four randomly-numbered buttons in increasing order.It also has the feature that I can set the alarm to something that slowly gets louder, rousing me gently, rather than jolting me and my wife awake.With these features, I don't have a problem getting up. And I will never go back to a LED alarm clock with infinite 9-minute snoozes and a ghastly beeping alarm.
How can I safely destroy a hard disk?
You are not supposed to throw away those computer parts, you should recycle them just like how you would recycle your batteries. Find recycling places in your city that takes computers and electronics. Wipe/Format your hard drive so it doesn't have your information on there and send it away to be recycled. 
How do I manage my cat food in the absence of maid?
If the cat's over six months old, it doesn't need lunch - in fact, once a day is quite adequate, but put food down in the morning and more when you get home. For if you're away for longer than a day, you'll need a timed cat feeder as mentioned elsewhere.
Prevent scruffy towels
Historically, laundry (including towels) was hung on clothes lines in the outdoors where the wind and other elements would jostle the clothes sufficiently to soften them up. In the absence of a yard to place a dedicated clothes line, apartments usually included a pulley system from window to window strung across the streets and alleys to give folks the space they needed. Apartment living in NYC circa 1900, courtesy WikipediaIn modern times, such sites are less common (or you may simply not have that space), but the premise behind these techniques might spur further ideas.
Prevent scruffy towels
You need to make sure to rinse off all the detergent and there's none left on the towel before you dry it. Sometimes the washer doesn't give it a completely thorough rinse enough to get ALL the detergent off. If you are not using a tumbler dryer, just make sure to give extra rinse to the towel before hanging it up. 
Replacement for a sheet pan
If you have some aluminum foil, you can double up a few sheets of it to make a substitute "pan" out of the foil. If you wish for it to be a bit sturdier, you can take some sturdy cardboard and wrap it in the foil. Note: be aware that if you are cooking near 400 degrees Fahrenheit or above, the cardboard could catch on fire.
How can I safely destroy a hard disk?
You mentioned you don't have any heavy tools around. However, if you have a sidewalk or other un-damagaible solid surface in your area, you could put the drive in a bag of some kind (to contain pieces) and drop it as hard as possible on the surface several times.Also, in the area where I live, there are services that will destroy it for you (but obviously, if you want it done free, it's best to do it yourself).Once you have done that, you should take it some place that can recycle the contents of the drive. 
How to not forget the washed clothes in the washing machine
If you like home automation (as I do), you could add a magnetic door contact sensor to your washing mashine door, let opening the tray set an alarm and opening the lid disable the alarm.That alarm should be delayed and repeat of course. You can also use IFTTT's Maker channel to easily send you push notifications.You actually gave me an idea on what to do next. :)
Inhaling less chalk dust while erasing blackboard during teaching
Assuming you are not forced to use a duster, I'd suggest cleaning the boards with water in the following way: There are special tools designed to clean windows one is called t-bar and  squeegee.You first make the mop reasonably wet, swipe over the board horizontally, beginning at the top and then going down (with slight overlap). Then you take the squeegee and dry it in the same pattern (also with slight overlap).This method is much faster (around 30s for 5m^2) than it sounds, I'd argue even faster than using a duster. My teachers regularly do this even during the lectures and it is not disruptive at all. The downside is that some water will run down the board, but most boards have a small sill to catch it; there it can be soaked up with a towel. I'd suggest buying a rather large (~50cm) t-bar and mop and a smaller squeegee so you only have to apply reasonable force to get the necessary pressure. 
Replacement for a sheet pan
I have used oven safe glass plates (Corningware brand in the US) when I needed a low top pan. You will need to be extremely careful as they can be heavy. When dropped and hot, they can shatter.
What are ways to modify a key for tactile differentiation?
The visual approach that also works in the dark:For one single key, a plastic cap or ring (costs a few cents at a hardware store) is probably the easiest solution.My choice though would be nailpolish - there are some that have a sandy or grainy or rubbery texture and I have some already at hand. So the one that doesn't slip when grabbed is the key in question. Ask a girlfriend if she can spare a few drops, if necessary.
What are ways to modify a key for tactile differentiation?
The geometrical approach:For someone who does not want to modify the key itself, use a deliberate disorder:If all keys are on one ring, have all keys oriented in the same direction, the one to be found in the dark in the opposing direction.For multiple rings like in your question, put the special key on it's own ring. If more keys are alone on a ring, use a short "chain" of two rings so that the one is singeled out or slip a tiny object like a bead onto the key ring. This should not add much bulk to the key ring like a special pendant might.
Prevent scruffy towels
The tumbler softens your towel by "massaging" the fibers while drying so that the towels don't get stiff.On vacations I have mimicked that by scrunching, kneading or twisting the stiff towel a few times in different directions before using it, which will at least make them somewhat softer. Hoping for the extra-fluffy tumbler-dried feel is probably too much to expect here.It works especially well if you have to line-dry without lots of wind (which would do a similar job) and you manage to get that point where the towel is still very slightly damp, redistributing the remaining humidity helps softening the fibers. Repeat with the dry towels, if necessary.
How do I securely tie my shoes?
I saw something on TV about this (nothing to do with the type of laces).The space scientist Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock said that most people tie their shoe laces the wrong way. The right way will make the laces tighter and more secure while also looking better.Basically, she said that instead of going clockwise with the non-looped lace, you go anti-clockwise [?]. You know you've done it correctly when the 'ears' sit right.You could probably find the episode of the show, it's called "Duck Quacks Don't Echo". It was the episode with the welsh comedian, Rhod Gilbert.As for me, my mother taught me to do laces differently to everyone else. I didn't even notice until years later. My mother taught me to just make two hoops and tie them together, so that is what I have always done.
What are ways to modify a key for tactile differentiation?
Use woolen threads of different colors to differentiate the keys. That will not only help you differentiate your keys but also looks colorful and elegent.
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
Pushing the snooze button so many times is not an addiction(what you call). It signifies how lazy and irresponsible you are. You don't need a life hack for the reason. All you need is motivation(no offence).Drink lots of water before sleep so that you will wake up to pee. Once you get into washroom make sure you don't come back and sleep. Rather brush your teeth and finish your morning ablutions and get back to your work.This is what i do my self everyday. It helps! Time is precious make the best use of it. 
What are ways to modify a key for tactile differentiation?
You could dip the head of the key in a rubber coating product (google "dip rubber coating" for example products).  This would give you a visual and a tactile way to distinguish the key.  These products are also commonly used to put a nice non-slip grip on tool handles.A cheaper alternative would be to dip it in rubber cement, but I'm not sure how well it would hold up over time.
How to rid steelware of metallic taste
Lacking data I cannot be sure, but the metallic taste most probably comes from residue soap components (bases, the soap itself, proteinases ...) all of which can be washed away with water and a little scrubbing with your hand. I highly assume a dishwater save metal is also reasonably inert and therefore has no distinct taste. 
How to not forget the washed clothes in the washing machine
Just put an alarm in your phone when you put in the laundry for approximately 1 hour. Snooze it or next time set it later if the machine isn't finished yet.Good luck.
How to not forget the washed clothes in the washing machine
The phone alarm has been suggested before. But often I start the machine and then go out. So when the alarm beeps, I'm not at home to open it and I forget it later. So I put the alarm to the time at which I know I'll return.In my experience clothes can be wet inside the machine for up to 12 hours before they start to smell. Also, insted of a normal softener, use a hygienic softener, which destroys 99,9% of bacteria. Bacteria are the source of the smell.
removing corrosion on the contacts of an Apple USB-to-Lightning cable
Soak it in distilled white vinegar for a few minutes.Vinegar can be used to remove corrosion. Dip the end of the corroded cable in a small amount of distilled white vinegar for a few minutes. If the corrosion is really bad, the end of the cable may have to be soaked for an hour or more. After removing the end of the cable from the vinegar, baking soda can be used to neutralize any remaining acid. Any remaining corrosion can be removed using steel wool.I hope that expanded answer is elaborate enough for Just Do It.
Camelbak bottle VS sticker remover
This is very common thing to happen. If the material is rubber/ plastic based, immersing it into hot water could help. You can try scrubbing it of while the area is submerged in hot water. Please note that the bottle is resistant to hot water. Also, do not over heat the water as it may damage the bottle, as well as burn your hand. The paper residue might not vanish instantly. You might have to do this a couple of times. The residue should vanish after a few days of usage. Also, I would advice you not to scratch it off using anything points, as you may end up damaging the bottle, or leaving on it scratch marks.Another way into to moisten the area and Gently use sandpaper. But, then again be careful you don't damage the bottle. 
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
I solved this problem by eating three meals a day. Eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner shifted my circadian rhythm. I started waking up early without an alarm clock. I wake up early now because I am hungry. I have become a morning person.It took months for my body to adjust, so do not expect instant results from this method. There is a lot of initial effort required in that you will have to force yourself to get up early to eat breakfast for a few weeks. Also, your stomach may not like having food thrown into it when it is not expecting it.If you are in a hurry and miss breakfast one morning, make sure you eat lunch and dinner. You can also have a late breakfast as long as you still eat lunch and dinner. Try to eat dinner as early as possible without leaving yourself hungry at bedtime. If you are hungry at bedtime, eat just enough to get to sleep.One of the side benefits of this approach is that you will sleep better. Eating three meals a day seems to cause calories to be released more evenly into the bloodstream. In turn, the even release of calories seems to improve sleep.Taking a 30 minute walk during the day will improve your digestion and help you sleep. Try to exercise before your evening meal. Exercising too late in the day can make it hard to get to sleep.At the time of this writing, none of the answers above attacked the real problem: You do not want to get up early. In my experience, alarm clock tricks only work for people who actually want to get up early. As long as you do not want to get up early, your body will adapt to each of these tricks until you are back where you started. Until you fix the underlying problem, you will always have trouble getting up early.
Camelbak bottle VS sticker remover
Try using rubbing alcohol to remove stickers in the future. The white spirit appears to have altered the plastic of the bottle. Rubbing alcohol can remove sticker glue without affecting most plastics.
Problem with broken mouthpiece of tube
Press the tip of the tube into a marble-sized piece of modeling clay. The seal should be sufficient to preserve the product and the clay durable/malleable enough to continue use until the tube has been emptied. 
Reducing the high pitched sound of writing on chalkboard
Very simple, in my experience -- change your writing style if needed (in my day, teachers learned to do this, if they were any good), so you only pull the chalk, never push it.  That is, slant the chalk so it's not at right angles to the board, and move it so the tip in contact is following the one in your hand, not leading.  I've never witnessed a bad squeak when done this way.
How to stop shoes from squeaking on hard floors?
I have two pairs of shoes that make so much noise on the tile floor at work that my co-workers make jokes about them. I tried the soap - took a small bar (hotel size, actually hotel-supplied), unwrapped it,  and just rubbed the bar all over the bottom of the sole, with some extra emphasis on worn spots.  Ninja quiet now.  I keep the bar in my desk drawer. smells good, and works great. 
Problem with broken mouthpiece of tube
What type of facial product it is? If it is fluid, probably you can transfer into any other air tight container.
How should I store clothes to prevent animal damage and smell?
Definitely not in a cardboard box. Keeping your clothes in a cardboard box makes it easy for pest maybe not to feed on but to rest and play around. Rather keep them in a safe place like cupboard. You can use naphthalene balls or maybe any soap bars to help odor.

How can I improve air quality in my car?
Yes. An inexpensive ionizer that plugs in to the lighter socket will:  remove fumes and dust from the airprovide ions which increase alertnessShould only cost as much as dinner out and could save your life. After a year or so the metal surfaces that emit ions might get corroded and so can be scraped with the edge of a sharp knife to make them sharp and shiny again. These devices are widely available. Similar devices can be used at home to remove cooking smells, pet odors, and make the air feel fresher. (These must be cleaned occasionally.)
How can I improve air conditioning effectiveness in my old car?
If you have an old car and it is not already a light color (silver, white, tan) you can paint most of the roof white. This reflects away a large amount of sun-heat: about 100 Watts equivalent per square foot. If you have a wagon or other large roof, this could be 15 square feet / 1.5 Sq Meters and so would be as much as a small electric room heater. Imagine running one of those inside your car on a blazing day? Now, throw it out the window. This is the level of improvement I am talking about.I did this. Touch test: I put my hand on the white part when it had been sitting in the sun for hours: warm but I could leave my hand there indefinitely. Moved my hand one foot over to the "bronze" colored part of the roof: could not leave it there more than two seconds! Big difference. It can be yours, for the cost of a can of spray paint. Doesn't really matter if it is auto paint or some other durable exterior type (it will look rough anyway). You can do a neat enough job with masking tape and newspaper. Remove the easily removable parts of a luggage rack. Avoid other nearby objects (expensive cars especially) whilst painting. Mostly people cannot see the roof of the car, so it is not a big appearance issue. And if they notice, just say that you drive kids to school (school bus roofs are often painted white, hmm).
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
The problem isn't that big when I get up at around noon.Then the problem is your circadian rhythm, not the snooze bar.The best advice I've ever heard, is that you can go to sleep whenever you want but you have to wake up at the same time every day regardless if you've the day off. Get yourself on a schedule and you will find it unavoidable to wake up to it, and you will feel better when you do.Eventually, you'll start finding yourself awake before it even goes off the first time. The key to not wanting to hit the snooze bar is motivation. Mine is having enough time to brew my own coffee. Also, continued employment is nice... I get the feeling you're a student, where being late is only a waste of your own money. You'll learn real quick, one way or another, how not to hit that bar later on in the real world.
How can I improve air conditioning effectiveness in my old car?
Use windshield shades. Starting with a cooler car reduces the amount of cooling required to get to a comfortable range. You can purchase them from a local automotive retail store or make your own.If you make your own, be sure to paint or cover with a light colored cloth to reflect the amount of sunlight being absorbed into the shade.You will also want to fit the shade so that the entire windshield is covered.Making the shade fit closer to the glass will also prevent "heat leakage" from around the sides of the shade.
How can I improve air conditioning effectiveness in my old car?
If you are driving in an area with relatively low humidity (less than 80%), you could use a misting sprayer as an evaporative cooler. It works by having water moisture being reabsorbed into the atmosphere. Evaporative coolers lower the temperature of air using the principle of evaporative cooling, unlike typical air conditioning systems which use vapor-compression refrigeration or absorption refrigerator. Evaporative cooling is the addition of water vapor into air, which causes a lowering of the temperature of the air. The energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat, which affects the temperature of the air, and converted into latent heat, the energy present in the water vapor component of the air, whilst the air remains at a constant enthalpy value. This conversion of sensible heat to latent heat is known as an adiabatic process because it occurs at a constant enthalpy value. Evaporative cooling therefore causes a drop in the temperature of air proportional to the sensible heat drop and an increase in humidity proportional to the latent heat gain. Evaporative cooling can be visualized using a psychrometric chart by finding the initial air condition and moving along a line of constant enthalpy toward a state of higher humidity.
How can I improve air conditioning effectiveness in my old car?
Use the max a/c function with the interior air recirculating function which cools the interior cabin air. When it begins to feel cooler then change back to normal A/c function. If you have an ECO button disable it for max cooling effect. The ECO button adjusts A/c , automatic transmissions and throttle sensitivity (on vehicles with drive by wire systems) for maximum fuel efficiency. When disengaged A/c operated much better. The more humid the better.Open the rear windows down a inch while driving and the suction created by the slipstream of your moving vehicle would suck out the hot air and increase the effect of the A/c. Opening the rear windows fully would waste too fuel because your window acts like a parachute. Once you approach your comfort zone roll up the rear windows and chill on.The 12,000 Btu compressor uses only 4.7162 Hp and since available horsepower is dependent on RPM . When driving in city air conditioning uses a higher percentage of available power. On the highway the reverse is true.
How can I improve air quality in my car?
A few good tricks that use to deal with odors in a vehicle. For cloth seats and carpeting: Spray bottle with vinegar and spray until seats and carpeting are  moist. Then allow vehicle to sit in full sunlight. When dry everything will smell nice. Floor mats: Use a power washer with water and one cup of vinegar. The reason this works is because vinegar is a powerful anti-bacterial and disinfectant which most odor causing don't develop resistance to because of its acidity. Most life lives in a relatively narrow pH range. Of course there are exception to this rule (some deep deep underwater life ...OMG)
How can I overcome using the snooze function of my alarm clock?
Short circuit your sleep need by going to bed and to sleep earlier.  If you're going down later and continuously shortchanging your body of sleep, then go to bed 4 hours earlier than normal.TV won't care, the internet won't care, whatever you're doing in the evening can be done some other time if at all.  My best fix was staying off the Imgur website - because it was endless, there was no defined finish, and the clock kept slipping around.   3AM bedtime with an alarm at 7 AM simply won't work for long.
My nose is always dry from inside and therefore very irritating. How to keep it moistened?
You need:-A large bowl-A towel-Hot waterDirectionsBring several cups of water to boil and then pour into your bowl. Place your face over the bowl (not too close though, as the steam can be quite hot) and drape a towel over your head and the bowl to trap the steam. Breathe deeply for 5-10 minutes, and then follow up 15 minutes later with an application of coconut oil. If you don’t feel like making up a bowl of hot water just for your nose, even inhaling the steam from a cup of tea or taking a hot shower can really help.
How can I improve air conditioning effectiveness in my old car?
Check to see if all the R-134a leaks out (meaning there's nothing in the loop to carry away heat). Make sure the compressor is turning.The other sorts of problems that the AC might be experiencing include: bad switches, bad fuses, broken wires, broken fan belt (preventing the pump from turning), or seal failure inside the compressor. If the system cools, but not much, it could just be low pressure and you can top up the refrigerant.
My nose is always dry from inside and therefore very irritating. How to keep it moistened?
Not much of a lifehack, but you could just opt for a nasal spray like: http://www.amazon.com/Ayr-Saline-Nasal-Soothing-Ounce/dp/B0010NSC1U?ie=UTF8&keywords=nose%20moisture&qid=1461915929&ref_=sr_1_1_a_it&sr=8-1
My nose is always dry from inside and therefore very irritating. How to keep it moistened?
Any nasal spray containing soothing oil will do wonders. Some products use aloe, others use sesame oil. People where I live (VERY arid Namibia) put a small dab of petroleum jelly on the tip of one of their fingers and stick it in their nose and try and spread it evenly. This also works very well. Having to wash you hands all the time, is a nuisance though.
How can I improve air conditioning effectiveness in my old car?
Wear fewer clothes while driving so you get the benefit of what cooled air there is.  Push socks down, roll sleeves/trouser cuffs up to maximise skin area.Change your carseat covers for something cooler, and lighter shaded.Drive with lighter-weight shoes on, or no shoes at all (aside, this is a great way to drive more "gently" too)Park in the shade, means less work for the AC to do.  Consider removing window tints, and putting something lighter coloured on dark dashboards to reduce the sun effect (but don't block vents)A pale coloured car cover can help too.When you start to drive, open the windows and let the hotter air blow out for 2-3 minutes, before you start the AC.  This helps fuel economy too.Finally, fet your AC professionally serviced.    The receiver-dryer is possibly EOL if the car is 20 years old.  It could also have the older refrigerant which should be removed before it leaks, and the newer safer R134 inserted instead.  Remembering to do regular maintenance is a life hack.
How can I improve air conditioning effectiveness in my old car?
Once the interior is comfortably cool, there's a limit to how many degrees temperature differential a refrigeration system (like your air conditioning) can maintain between the hot exterior and the cooled interior.  My experience with older cars puts this at around 30 degrees F for a well functioning system.  When the car is traveling at highway speed, you should have adequate cooling airflow, so as not to overheat the engine, so the only accessible factor is how fast your car accepts heat from outside.  This depends mainly on two factors: how much solar heating gets in, and how much heat conducts through the body work from the outside air.Applying a reflective window film can help reduce solar heat uptake, but may be restricted by law (North Carolina, for instance, requires that after market window tints must transmit some minimum amount of light, and tests this for an extra fee at annual safety inspections).  A low-absorption roof finish of some kind (white paint absorbs less heat than silver, and causes less glare for nearby high vehicles) can greatly reduce solar heating through the roof.Another improvement would be to insulate the roof by applying foam between the headliner and roof.  Similar insulation could be applied inside the door panels.  Combine this with a mirror-finished roof and windows as reflective as your local law allows, and you might increase your maximum differential cooling by ten degrees or more -- which could be very significant on a long drive in high ambient temperatures (like summer in the South or Southwest of the United States).If you don't need the extra cooling for comfort, you can save fuel by running the A/C at "Max" or "Recirculate" setting, and turning the compressor off and one to regulate cabin temperature -- the power draw of the compressor is the same at "Max" as at any other temperature setting, so turning it off for a while now and then will save fuel compared to running it constantly and adding engine heat back into the chilled air for comfort.
How can I improve air conditioning effectiveness in my old car?
I know this might sound odd but the shape of the vehicle plays a big role in cooling. If the vehicle were designed as say a moving cylinder, it would solve the cooling problems.
How to open a frozen car door?
One trick I use is to get a thin belt, buckle the belt into a loop, and close the driver-side door with the belt looped over the top right corner. When you need to open the door, you can pull on that belt really hard without hurting anything. The belt just needs to be sturdy enough to handle the pulling force, and thin or soft enough to not interfere with the weather stripping on the door. It could also be a rope, strap, etc. It looks a little shabby, depending on what you use, but not as shabby as a broken door handle.I broke off the handle of a frozen-shut door before I came up with this method.
How to open a frozen car door?
For a frozen lock i suggest to press a hot water bag on the lock area for some time. The metal of the door transports the heat quite well towards the lock inside and it contains more energy then just a bit of hot water that runs down the door. For the door itself i suggest loosening it mechanically, i.e. pushing it, however your options are more limited here when the freeze already happened.Prevent it to happen again by covering the car door rubber seals with protective liquid, which can be bought in various shops.

How can I straighten a slightly bent 3.5mm headphone plug?
If you want to replace it. Simply cut the original plug off. You can buy replacement pieces any electronics store. You need a 1/8 inch or a 1/4 inch stereo headphone plug depending on your application. On the plug there are 3 connections that are separated by plastic insulators. The tip or center connection is for the left, the longer (ring) is for the right, the elongated metal piece with 2 little wings is the ground. Those little wings you gently bend around cable with just enough pressure to hold it in place firmly. With a knife remove about a 1/2 inch of the plastic insulation from the headphone cable . You will then see 3 colored wires -black, red, and white.On the small wires remove about 1/8 inch of the insulation. Use a small soldering iron to join the wires to the connectors.Black= ground , Red = left,  White =right (if memory serves me right) . If it sounds odd afterwards reverse the left and right connections. I forget to mention there are 2 types of plugs. Male and Female plugs- the reason for this should be obvious. The one on the headphones are the male plug type.

How can you get your car as cool as possible on a hot summer day without air conditioning?
Car shadeRain guardsI've been combining these two techniques for years.  The car shade stops your car from turning into a greenhouse and it keeps UV light from damaging your dashboard.  I use it even in winter.The rain guards mean you can habitually crack the windows without worrying about the forecast.  They let any heat that does build up vent naturally and it makes the fact that your windows are cracked less visible.  Makes me feel a little more secure.Even on the hottest days I've never been uncomfortable getting in the car so long as I remembered to use these.  They certainly beat my old hack of rolling down the windows and driving like a maniac until the AC kicked in.
What to do if your shaver broke halfway through shaving?
Want your beard gone without touching a blade?  ConsiderthreadingIn threading, a thin (cotton or polyester) thread is doubled, then twisted. It is then rolled over areas of unwanted hair, plucking the hair at the follicle level. Unlike tweezing, where single hairs are pulled out one at a time, threading can remove short lines of hair....It is also used as a method of removing unwanted hair on the entire face and upper lip area. wikipedia.org: Threading_(epilation)

removing corrosion on the contacts of an Apple USB-to-Lightning cable
Use a pencil eraser.  People have been cleaning electrical contacts with pencil erasers for as long as there have been contacts that needed cleaning.  Some examples...One thing to note - those metal strips are actually very easy to damage, so don't scrub at them like a dirty stove-top, treat them gently.Gentle repetition is better than aggressive over-eagerness.As for prevention...assuming it's because of moisture getting to it, any oil-based product will help - WD-40, even olive oil, used very sparingly will not adversely affect the conductivity. When inserted into the iDevice socket, the mechanical pressure of the contacts is sufficient to push through the oil layer.
Comfortable Ways of Riding a Bike Barefoot
Just go barefoot on the pedals. I've been walking around barefoot for a year and after about a month your feet get tougher and you get used to feeling different sensations. Sensations which others might find unpleasant at first but once you realize they won't cause you harm you can enjoy the experience. When biking I've found that if I place my foot correctly I can let the spikes rest between by toes and push down on the pedals with the ball of my foot. This also lets me better grip the pedals and help pull the pedal back up on the upstroke. It takes a little while to get used to but is actually quite enjoyable.
Child safe water hose
Remove the faucet handleMany outdoor faucet handles do not need the center screw to operate. To remove the handle, hold the handle with one hand to keep it from turning and remove the center screw holding it on. Save the original screw or nut to be reattached later and store the handle in a safe place that is easy to reach before you go outside. When you need to use the faucet, simply fit the handle back over the stem so you can turn it on and off. When you are done, take the handle with you. *Not all faucets work this way so your results may vary.
How to rid steelware of metallic taste
That's a strange thing.Your own steel ware has probably the mention "INOX" or "stainless steel". That's why it should have no taste.If the one at work is cheaper quality, it could give metallic taste. Which means, you actually eat a few metallic ions every time.Some metals are health damaging! For example nickel or lead is bad.Worst is aluminum! NEVER use aluminum!Don't eat in blank aluminum dishes, don't use aluminum fork or spoon, never cook in blank aluminum. You could eventually use aluminum foil to wrap food if you don't heat it up.I don't know in which country you are but in Europe we have been told, aluminum raises the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

Tumble-drying a fitted sheet without getting other things tangled in it
One solution, which I found off reddit or a forum years ago, is to tie the fitted sheet into a big loose knot.  I do this twice which makes the pockets for other items to slip in much smaller.The tied up part may not be completely dry after one cycle.  So afterward, I pull everything else out when it's dry, and if needed give the fitted sheet an extra 10 minutes.UpdateI found two related reddit threads:LPT Request: How do I keep my fitted sheet from eating the rest of my cloths in the dryerLPTR: How do I prevent my fitted sheet from "eating" everything else in the dryer with itSome suggestions from the first:I used to fold my sheet before putting it in the dryer. Just a couple of loose folds with the corners in, not fully folded. It got dry just fine and usually didn't open to envelop the rest of the clothes...I have this problem as well, even if I only throw it in with my regular sheet and pillow cases...
How can i prevent a drinking glass from getting knocked over?

Randomizing papers
Sit down with your stack of documents and a D100 (gaming equipment, usually seen as a pair of D10, one designated as tens and the other as units).  Roll the die, and count down the stack the number esimated, and transfer that document to a new stack.  Reroll if there aren't enough documents for a given roll (optionally, switch to smaller dice as convenient, i.e. D20 when there are only 20 documents left).  When there is only one document remaining, transfer it to the new stack.This method should approximate a uniformly random condition after a single pass.A potentially more time-effective variation on this method would be to set up a document rack, row of folders, etc., and sort the documents into the rack based on the die rolls, taking the top document from the original stack but putting it in the slot indicated by the roll.  Re-rolling duplications would given the same measure of randomness in the final result, and progress would be significantly faster.

Messy but simple...Throw them up in the air. Collect them up again.Making sure they're all the right way round isn't really necessary, as you're going to go through them one at a time anyway.Caveats:Don't do it outdoors.Don't do it near water.Maybe check the stapling quality before a multi-sheet paper-shower.The question was not to get even redistribution, merely randomisation.The actual randomisation of this will work well, assuming sufficient ceiling height. The gym would be a good location - high ceiling, very little chance of losing any.This may also provide some amusement for the students.

It's not a life hack, but a power line option is a fantastic alternative to give you a wired connection anywhere in your building.
Randomizing papers
OK, as my first, rather frivolous method seems to not be convincing people, method 2 - still requiring no math, mental or otherwise & would be far more gentle on larger paper-sets......again, I am not going for perfectly random redistribution, just sufficiently disordered.Start with an empty desk.In any order you like, lay down sufficient sheets to fill the desk, in some semblance of a regular pattern.Using your own judgement, repeat the process for layer 2.Note that if you like, you can put a 3rd paper on one pile, or leave one off another pile.Continue until you are out of papers.Pick up the piles, again using your own judgement of something approximating a random order.Further randomisation can be achieved by picking up each pile with obverse or reverse face up.Repeat the entire process, if necessary.
How can I improve air conditioning effectiveness in my old car?
As was stated earlier, window tinting is a highly effective way to reduce heat entering the cabin. What most people are unaware of is that you can also apply a film that only blocks IR/UV transmission. This is almost optically invisible for those who find normal window tinting to be too dark at night. Additionally, if your car is fitted with privacy glass, it doesn't filter UV or IR which means a large part of heat transmission will be entering via these windows.Also, do a google search to find what type of coolant is installed in your vehicle. This can be found from manufacturer documentation, or via the type of fittings used to connect to the recharge port. There may be a higher performing coolant that is compatible with your system. This has the added benefit of ensuring that there is no flammable refrigerant in the system, which can be quite a hazard in the event of a frontal collision.If your vehicle was intended for a different climate to where you live, the condenser may be undersized and not dissipating enough heat. Change it over to something that has more effective surface area to ensure correct operation.
How do I put protective screens on, without getting air bubbles?
The cheapest/easiest/fastest way to do this is with Windex.  I own a tech company - we install thousands of them..wipe the ipad down clean (and by clean, I mean, clean it, then turn it off, hold it to a light at an angle so you can see the reflection, and slowly inspect every square millimeter)... step back 24-36" away from it, spray it 1x with windex.  I recommend "wasting" a few shots to make sure your windex is spraying very evenly and not 'squirting'...apply the cover, curling it and applying from the middle out, or curling it up and working across from one side to the other.generally you can slide it around for a few seconds to get it right.'roll' out the excess moisture.  windex is alcohol-based, and will simply evaporate after a few minutes...
My nose is always dry from inside and therefore very irritating. How to keep it moistened?
Some people have recommended Nasal sprays. However, that could potentially have a longterm impact, such as chemical dependency, on your nose if you useful often (e.g many times per day).I would recommend buying a humidifier if you can place one in your room. Or, if not, another trick is place bowl of water or a wet towel nearby as you work or sleep. It will add moisture to the air as the water evaporates from your bowl or towel. Therefore, keeping the air moist and preventing your nose from getting too dry. 
"Window Decals" - Make them "moveable"
A covering over the sticker's adhesive surface (trimmed to fit) with clear double sided tape would probably work well.I expect that the adhesive from the sticker would likely bond with the adhesive on the tape to form a stronger bond than the bond formed between the glass and only the tape's adhesive.Thus, enabling you to easily remove the sticker while retain the adhesiveness of the sticker without obscuring it, and without drawing additional attention to it.Note: There are multiple levels of adhesiveness available for double sided tape, so you may need to experiment in order to find the ideal option.For example, the image above displays a product billed as Removable Double Sided Tape.

Padding metal hooks on car trunk bike rack
If you have an old bike tube laying around (or even a new one, if you're willing to spend a few bucks), you can cut it up and stick it between the hook and the trunk/hatch. If you don't plan on taking the rack off all the time you can just place them in there and they should stay. If you plan to remove the rack on a regular basis, you might consider two-sided taping them in, and/or keeping a little baggie full of spares in case you lose one.
Bringing the cold water to room temperature
Mix the two together sequentially.  That is, fill it up partially with cold water and finish the rest with hot.  After a while you will learn the best point in the cup to stop with one and switch to the other.Alternatively, get water from a regular tap instead of a water heater/cooler, or bring your own in a reusable bottle. 
How can i prevent a drinking glass from getting knocked over?
+1 to the Mighty Mug as it's designed to solve this specific problem.Also consider getting a sippy cup lid or a SipSnap (see NPR's "Turn Any Cup Into A Spillproof Sippy Cup") which are designed to not spill when knocked over (in most design cases, by kids, but these can also solve the problem for cats and stray elbows).   Finally, keep in mind that mugs that are shorter and wider (especially at the base) will have a lower center of gravity and be harder to knock over than something taller and skinnier.  In an extreme case, you could glue/fasten the bottom of your drinking cup on to a flat platform (piece of lead or something wide/heavy), to provide a stable base and give your arm a bit more of a workout each time you go to lift it up for a drink. 
Bringing the cold water to room temperature
Bring to work sufficient bottles to cover an entire day's supply.Fill them in the evening with cold water.The next day they will be the correct temperature, all day.Repeat by refilling in the evening.There is no risk in leaving them filled for 2 extra days over the weekend.If this would result in too many bottles, the alternative would be shorten the number required to 'the length of time taken to achieve correct temperature plus time taken to drink divided into day length.'If a bottle takes 2 hours to reach temperature & 2 hours to drink, then 2 bottles would be sufficient.You could still start with them all full each evening.
How to remove static from clothes and self?
You can always remove static from yourself by simply touching the ground with your hand as this will discharge any charge that is present on your body.Also, if you're working with computers and electronics, you should have a grounding strap connected to your wrist in order to prevent this build up of charge and protect sensitive components!
How to remove static from clothes and self?
Any static charge gained in the dryer will be lost on the first grounded object you touch.Your issue is due to subsequent build-up of charge, either from lack of fabric conditioner, which contains anti-static compounds, or you are regenerating more static from your interaction between shoes & carpet.For the first, use either commercially available anti-static dryer sheets; or even just a tightly screwed-up ball of aluminium foil in with the tumble-drying.For the second, change your shoes. Leather soles create less static than artificial soles, though some artificial soles produce more than others. You'd have to test your existing shoes empirically to see which are best.Also bear in mind that the entire effect is hugely influenced by atmospheric humidity, so don't think you've found the perfect solution on a rainy day.
How to restore fizz drink (eg. cola) after accidentally freezing it?
If you do not open the bottle (i.e. don't allow any CO2 to escape), thaw out the bottle so it is liquid again, and then wait long enough, the high CO2/gas pressure will eventually drop as the CO2 goes back into the liquid/cola. If you open the bottle too soon after thawing it, it will act just as if you had shaken the cola bottle and you will get a large CO2 gas escape and not as much fizz/CO2 in the cola. This all assumes that the freezing didn't raise the CO2 pressure so high that some of the CO2 escaped while the bottle was frozen.
Quickly clean and dry highball glasses
If you are hand washing the glass, I agree with Stephie that you should use a bottle brush or something similar when cleaning the glass.The lifehack comes when you want to dry the glass. If you take a dish drying cloth and continuously twist it while feeding it through the mouth of the glass, you will be able to feed it through even small openings and the cloth will expand inside the glass and dry all of the interior as you continue to twist it.
Bringing the cold water to room temperature
Microwave the cold water to temp.The temperature of a water coolers is pretty consistent. If you have your favorite glass or plastic tumbler (a known quantity of water), then you'll get to know exactly how long it takes to heat up the cold water to the perfect temperature. The advantage of this over "store water elsewhere" is that heating it on demand takes no advanced planning; you don't have to set aside water in sufficient quantities for later consumption. And if you like your water just a bit warmer or cooler than room temperature, you can control that too!

You don't have to use the tissue so hard.
How to get a stronger radio signal?
Signals on the FM(VHF) band are largely line of sight. They are also in a frequency band where nearby metal objects can interfere with the reception of signal due to partial or complete reflection of another signal on the same frequency. FM receivers are also affected by something referred to as capture effect. If your receivers has two signals of similar signal strengths by a certain number of Db(decibels) it will accept the stronger one and reject the weaker one. VHF and UHF signal reception can also be affected by the weather. FM broadcast signal are reliable generally for about 80KMs or so. The weird thing about FM reception is when you are in a dead spot, simply moving a little bit to the right or left can make quite a difference. 
How do I stop my earphones from getting tangled
Clean, tangle-free, and handy earbud storageWhen storing your earbuds, put them into a plastic snap-shut pill bottle with a notch cut to allow the cord to clear the lip of the bottle without crimping it. It doesn't need to be air tight.Wind the cord around the pill bottle.Either tuck the plug into the last turn of the cord, or push its tip into a small hole in the bottom. A sharp point will get the hole started. Keep the hole small enough to snugly hold the plug contact sleeve.Done.For use, pull out the earbud connector, plug it into your device, drop the bottle to unwind it. Grab the bottle, flip open the top, and place the (clean) buds into your ears.

How can I destroy sensitive documents without a paper shredder?
How to completely destroy sensitive paper documents—without shredding or burning.You'll need an old pair of panty-hose with no holes in them.

Stop fitted sheet from sliding on plastic-topped mattress?
Try clips, or pins, on either end of a short piece of cord or elastic. Try a cord length of about 1-1/2 feet. Make four. Attach one of these across each of the four corners of the bottom sheet selvage about 1 foot from the corner to reach diagonally. This will increase the amount of "tuck" under each of the corners to hold the bottom sheet from slipping in any direction.This will create a "fitted sheet" on steroids. It'll be a lot more secure with these between the mattress and the box-spring or bed stretcher.They're easy to remove and replace when you want to change the sheets

Kill Tiny Spider Without Contact
Shoot it with a rubber band.Finding a rubber bandRubber bands can be found near a postal drop box.  These boxes are for the postal service to store mail so the delivery person does not need an automobile.  Mail is typically bound with rubber bands, and delivery people tend to discard the bands on the ground.Shooting a rubber bandHold one hand as though you were pointing at something with your index finger.  Hold a rubber band in the other.  Prop the rubber band on the index finger of the hand that is pointing.  Pull back on the rubber band.  Letting go of the rubber band should send it flying in the general direction that you are pointing.Approaching the beastIt is probable that a spider that is not moving will not move unless it is bothered.  Your approach should be soft enough to not cause any sudden vibrations, slow enough to not cause much wind, and from a direction that will not cast a shadow on the spider.Actually killing the thingArm the rubber band and approach your target.  Each step closer increases your killing chance, but also that you disturb your prey.  Steady now.If you shoot a rubber band at a spider from the distance of a foot, you will probably be successful.

I am of the opinion that you can not tap CO2,once the can is opened. One simple method, you can try is to put the can immersed in a bowl of water having normal room temperature with some weight put on it. This will make the cold can to come to normal. In between this process, you need to touch the can and identify if that coldness is sufficient for you. If so, remove it from bowl and use it.

If you're too lazy to drag the vacuum cleaner to the bedroom, spend a few euros on a tin sucker, aka desoldering pump. A small and simple device. Useful for targets up to a few millimeters. It is more-or-less animal friendly: there is a good chance that the poor bug gets caught alive.

How can I keep the top floor of my house cool?
In case the cause of heating of top floor is a sun:If you have access to the roof, try to cover the roof with sunny-reflective material - foil, white tarpaulin. If your roof kind is a horizontal area with margins, you may strew a thin layer of white sand. Also you may stick some kind of heat insulation direct to ceiling.

How to wake up without waking up other people in the same room
Some people are lighter sleepers than others. Just getting out of bed may actually wake her - regardless of how you're woken up. Everytime there's movement in my bed, it wakes me, so you're probably not going to find something that will not wake her.Help her start her own business that she can do whilst she has an extra hour out of bed.
How can i prevent a drinking glass from getting knocked over?
I used to use a traditional pint glass (the curved ones that English pubs have plenty of) and would fill it with water. It was a good method of monitoring how much water I drink, but it also had a weighted glass base for this very reason - those darn drunk people knocking over glasses.I found one in my room the morning after a night at a pub whilst at university, but Ebay have plenty of them. They look great, and are designed to handle light knocks without falling over.
Stop fitted sheet from sliding on plastic-topped mattress?
If you're handy with a sewing machine, make a fully enclosed mattress cover - needs to be stretchy material, with a zip, so it fits tightly over the mattress, like this one available herehttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Velfont-Towelling-Enclosed-Mattress-Encasement/dp/B00E3S6AA4Otherwise just buy one, but that wouldn't count as a hack!
Stop fitted sheet from sliding on plastic-topped mattress?
Since it is staying on, but I'm guessing you mean the top is sliding around, you need some sort of frictional surface between the sheet and mattress. I have this foam grippy stuff that I usually see marketed as cupboard liners. You can find all sorts of sizes. I would put a layer of that down. It will grip the plastic and give the sheet something to grab onto. It is also soft so you shouldn't even know it's there. Here is a link to what I'm talking about, you might have some of this or something similar around your home. found on AmazonYou could also use some rubber strips if you have them, it just needs to have a lot of friction to keep the sheet still.

Removing mold from walls without use of harmful chemicals
A great way to help prevent the spreading of further mold is by purchasing a dehumidifier. I had a very similar issue in my home and found that a dehumidifier helped mould, damp & condensation build-up by controlling the the moisture in the air, which prevents the mold from growing. 
How to craft a non-return valve for air?
Using the same straw & a rubber-band, cut the end off a long 'sausage-shape' regular kid's party balloon [cheap rubber one, not the expensive 'tin cushion' mylar variety] & fasten the mouth-piece inflator section to the straw using the rubber band. The other end, where you cut the end off just flaps in the breeze.You may need to experiment with the right length to stop it sounding like a whoopee cushion when you blow, but any air pressure inside your bag will immediately seal it up as soon as the pressure inside is greater than outside.As mentioned in comments, if the pipe is too large, the balloon is likely to turn inside-out & fail, requiring a mesh to prevent that; but I think you ought to be OK using a straw.A round balloon might work just as well.Actually... mylar would probably work too, but they're expensive, by comparison.
How to craft a non-return valve for air?
Ball checks are the classic tool for this job.  You need a ball (in this case, ideally a light, fairly soft one), a cage to hold the ball near the tube outlet, and probably a very soft spring to push the ball into the tube outlet.  The softer the spring, the less pressure you'll need to push the ball off the seat and blow air into the bag; the softer the ball the less pressure will need to be in the bag to keep the ball sealed (the spring helps here).
Avoid feeling sick reading in a moving vehicle
You won't be able to avoid it, I'm afraid - in sensitive people, it's caused by a mismatch in the information the brain receives - the movement causes messages to be sent from your ears and certain receptors in the neck to your brain that you're moving, but the eyes are sending an opposing message, that is, you're not moving. And in some people, that causes nausea. The only way to avoid it is not to read, and actually, the way to never feel sick on buses, cars and coaches is to always look through the front window, at where you're going, or out the back window, where you've been. Looking out the side windows can cause nausea too. Sadly, I speak from experience....
What kinds of clothes are suitable to be packed in ziploc bags?
In general, you can put anything you like in a ziploc vacuum bag, but in my experience, if the air is completely vacuumed out, almost everything will be creased when taken out if the items are left in that condition for any length of time. So for actually moving house, use the bags, then remove and hang up or fold away as soon as you can. Many people use the bags to store winter clothing in summer and vice versa, but with the caveat that they may need either to rewash the clothing after 6 months, or press it, although some thicker items like fur coats lose the creasing after hanging up for a few days. That's if the vacuum bags retain integrity over time, of course, because it's also been my experience that many of them don't, so when you go the cupboard where you've stored the vacuum packed spare duvets, they've pushed the door open and are making a bid for freedom. Or worse, escaped over the hatch entrance up into the loft, meaning it's next to impossible to push it open from the outside.
Avoid feeling sick reading in a moving vehicle
You could take motion sickness pills if you want to get rid of the feeling completely, however I'm not sure if that would be your best choice if you are experiencing this problem every single day. I have motion sickness as well. Usually standing up on the bus helps, make sure you don't ride bus on empty stomach. Another trick to reduce the sickness is to not look down and try to look at farther objects like buildings and hills rather than sidewalks. Don't try to focus your attention on anything inside the bus, you need to look out of the window. Avoid sitting in the back of the bus also helps. Definitely don't read anything or keep looking down to check your phone. 
What kinds of clothes are suitable to be packed in ziploc bags?
From my experience, most clothes work fine in vacuum ziplock bags. The only ones you should avoid are clothes with heavy embellishments (especially sequins) as the sealing can damage/bend/break them. Anything else should survive the trip just fine. They will, however, come out creased. An easy way to fix this (especially if you're moving all your clothes!) is to hang them up in the bathroom right after you unpack them, and then blast the shower/bath on hot for a few minutes. the steam will relax the fabric and reduce the creasing. Dress shirts and other stiffer fabrics may need a little more work, but this will make cotton and most synthetics presentable again very quickly.
How to moisturize lips on the go?
The best approach is two-fold -- first of all, recognize the cause of dry lips: dehydration! Make an effort to drink more water. Another thing that helps me is to place a humidifier in my room while I sleep. I tend to breathe through my mouth when I sleep, and the extra water in the air helps keep me from losing too much water. I know it's tempting, but don't lick your lips when they feel dry. It'll only dry them out more.While you've said you've tried stuff like chapstick, certain people are very sensitive to certain ingredients common in most moisturizers (me included). Instead, try going with petroleum jelly/Vaseline. It'll help moisturize to prevent cracks, and help protect them while they heal. It's also safe to have close to your mouth, and doesn't have a weird taste. You can pick up little travel-sized containers of it from the travel toiletries section of most stores that are easy to throw in a book bag. I keep a little tub in my bag and a big one at home, so I don't have to risk misplacing either by moving them between bags. It's also great for dry/cracked hands, feet, knees, etc.

Try closed-cell high-density urethane. Such stuff is used as kneeling pads and knee-cushioning material for rug-installers who spend their day as rug-rats. Avoid standing in one place for long periods which can't be good for you, either. Something like a thin breathable natural fibre material (grass mats, futon, hooked wool rugs, etc.) must be even better than some kind of plastic. If you don't want to sit, consider leaning your butt on or against a stool to take the load off your tootsies for a bit.I located these to illustrate the product.They're from the Lee Valley Tool Co.

If you're more concerned with killing it than getting rid of it then use some compressed air or a gaseous deodorant can and turn it upside down before spraying. This makes the can spray an extremely cold residue that can easily kill a spider. I've done it before and the only issue is that you need to get rid of it afterwards. Something like compressed air would be perfect since there's no noticeable gas given off except for regular air.

What is the best way to paint a windshield wiper arm?
Remove wiper arm.  Wash it with soap and water. Hit it with some 220 grit sandpaper lightly. Rinse and dry. This will make your paint job better and stick better.  Spray with black spray paint.

Keeping Sleep Apnea mask on
Mittens might work - you're probably removing it with your hands in your sleep rather than it just coming off. But you need mittens without a thumb piece, like the ones babies have when they keep scratching their faces, so I'm thinking maybe try wearing a pair of socks on your hands, just to see if that stops you. They need to be not too loose though, and preferably of thick material, to make it difficult to use your fingers individually.
A soft floor cover to use with a standing desk
The cheapest and easiest solution is to use a cushion filler, with or without a fancy cushion cover, those ones that are soft fibrous inners with a soft outer white covering which you use to put in your own cushion covers. Link below shows examplehttp://www.wilko.com/cushions/wilko-cushion-inner-standard/invt/0068435and these cheap ones flatten down real quick, which is good if you want to stand on it. They come in larger sizes... I use these in bed under my heels because they get tender in the night.
Keeping Sleep Apnea mask on
Wrap a towel around your head. Make it tight enough to make removing the mask difficult, but not so much that it interferes with the mask..If you are still having issues, try using a large elastic band to secure the towel.It will take about 3 weeks for you to get "acclimatized" to wearing the mask every night.  You shouldn't need either the towel or banding after that.

Repainting measurement increments on tools
You are right on track with painting the surface, but you should act before the paint dries. Either cover the entire scale with paint or add a dollop or line of paint at one end, use a bench scraper to spread the paint over the scale, ideally back and forth. Scrape or wipe the excess paint off again with a rag, so that only the grooves remain coloured. Aim to work mainly perpendicular to the direction of the grooves so as not to remove the paint in them.This technique is well-known in all intaglio types of printing, e.g. etching.
Book holder for paperbacks
Here's a variation of the binder clip idea:First, even a large binder clip won't bite a large portion of a "perfect bound" book. There's a sort of fan-out that happens, and I find that a binder clip won't hold more than about 50 pages. So I clip the binder on the lower (or upper) edge of the book.Second, the binder clip alone doesn't hold most books open. Instead, with a bit of an angle, you can manage to slip the end of a pencil through one hoop-handle of the binder clip....then rest the spine of the book on your pencil. Voila! The book now pulls on the binder and holds itself open.
How to remove garlic smell from my mouth
One used to get capsules in my locale named "no-pong". Worked a treat, but I haven't felt the need to use them, or have seen them, in years.They consisted basically of vegetable oil and parsley extract. So I am guessing eating a few sprigs of fresh parsley and chasing it down with a tablespoon of olive oil, after consuming the garlic, may help (sort of forming a layer to prevent the sulfur compounds from escaping).Would not know if it worked though. I just accept the fact that others also smoke and eat other unpleasant foods, about which they don't worry, so I just brush my teeth as normal and for the rest people must just man up quid pro quo.
What's the usage of the compartment underneath the cover of a suitcase?
The "X" strap has a small clasp in the centre. Unclip that and spread the two halves open. Place folded sweaters, dress shirts, skirts, and other folded outerwear in the lid compartment. Close the X and zip the cover closed to hold everything in place.Here's how to prepare a suit & shirtEdit: I use the supplied flat hanger that comes with the case. Place the hanger inside the suit coat as you would any hanger. Close the suit coat overlapping the sides more than you normally would to button it until the body of the suit coat fits inside the lid. Push the shoulders toward the middle and lay the sleeves on top of the suit coat so it will fit. At this point, the suit is narrow enough to fit. Now close the X and clasp it over the front of the coat. Fold the length of the suit coat in half and zip the cover closed to hold everything in place.Now, when you close the cover, the apparel in the cover is held in place by the X strap. More can be placed flat on the folded clothing and held there by the zippered cover.Without the strap and/or the zipped cover, the things in the lid would slide down toward the hinge as you closed the lid unless you had a couple of more hands to hold things in place.You can use some imagination and find other things they are good for, too.

How can I keep my knits and sweaters from pilling?
Water-efficient vertical drum washers, I find, are much gentler on fabrics than the horizontal washers. This is probably because the impeller in the older washers caused friction between layers of fabric, while the tumbling action of vertical machines causes less rubbing.In any event, use the least detergent, least water and shortest cycle. Hand-washing with mild detergent such as Woolite was once required, but the HE washers seem just as mild.After much wear, even without washing, though, some yarns pill.
How to clean 'Iron removal filter'?
I shall try to respond to the only familiar words in the question: tiresome, effort, time, and my favourite word easier. I think that the word efficient may not apply.Disclaimer: I cannot say much about the backflow of water. If you have to reverse the filter between two pipe fittings, and put it back into the water line, I don't understand. …If you are talking about pouring some water into the back end with a funnel, say, that's different.It's an iron filter. Perhaps a strong rare-earth magnet dropped into the open end of the water filter, withdrawn using a string, remove iron particles from the thing, and repeat.It's a pain to sit there under the sink with a heavy spoon whacking the filter. Perhaps a strong electric vibrator can be fastened to the side of the filter to do the whacking for you.An old-fashion heavy-duty fire alarm bell has an electro-magnetic clapper that can out-tap you 1000 times better. Get one at a salvage store, remove the noisy bell and let the little ball bang away.If you have a hammer-drill, you can make a collar from a steel adjustable ring, make and attach a collet to go into the drill chuck and let the drill hammer away at the filter.
How can I keep my knits and sweaters from pilling?
Pilling of fabric occurs during wear more than by care.Washing loostens the fibres in some fabrics by removing the "sizing" (a kind of starch) used to give "body" to most flat fabric finishes during their manufacture. While you cannot replace the sizing in the fabric, you can avoid strong detergents and fabric softeners that hasten the softening of the fabric finish. Avoid tumble drying.Since pilling occurs when two surfaces rub against each other, avoiding that will reduce pilling.Going further; the removal of the pills as soon as you can will help reduce their numbers but I have NO practical evidence of this
How to clean transparent silicone/jelly cases?
Yellowing of materials that touch your skin can be the result of the oils on your skin being transferred to your phone case. Most likely, if this is the cause the most pronounced discolouration will be where your skin touched the case.Remedy: Remove the case periodically and wash it with a mild soap, dry, and replace on the phone.Overall yellowing of the case evenly is probably something in your environment reacting to the composition of the case material. It is probably not something "cleanable." Being able to change this might be unfeasible and/or impractical.Remedy: Don't you just love yellow silicone phone cases?Avoid harsh cleaning materials, cleansers, and miracle liquids.

How can I dim the 20+ LEDs that are in my room to help with sleep?
If you can, move the gadgets to another room. Not only will this mean the little blue and green lights to indicate they are charging or whatnot won't bother you, but it also means whatever buzzes and vibrations they may emit (as notifications or just a background noise) won't disrupt your sleep. There is no need for your phone to charge right next to your bed - it could charge in the kitchen or bathroom. If you can't, consider getting a sleep mask - a fabric eyeshade held on with mild elastic. Some people claim these make their faces hot but I have several that are extremely comfortable. They block the light, so you don't need to make the room light-free. As a pleasant side effect, once you come to associate the mask with sleeping, you will fall asleep more quickly even in situations where it's hard to sleep, such as while traveling.If you can't move the devices or shade your eyes, perhaps something as simple as a small cardboard box that you put (upside down) over the gadgets to cover their lights, and remove in the morning. I wouldn't like this because the box would be around all day, but it could work.
Tricks for opening very tight jars
I consume a lot of food in such jars and almost always they just won't open. Two methods that I find most effective:Punch a hole in the lid. To make the process easy and safe I use a small hammer and a masonry nail (short and thick nail for concrete walls) or a similar sharp object, like a center punch tool, which you can easily hold in hand while tapping it with a hammer. So you practically don't need to apply any power to open the jar and don't need to ruin your knifes.If you want to reuse the lid, use a leather work glove, not rubber. You can get a pair for ca.10 bucks, and it can be much better investment than a jar opener. Unlike other methods and thin rubber gloves, these not only give good grip but also reduce the pain in the hand especially if the cap is really tight and you must apply a lot of power. Till now I could open so all the jars without hassle. But this still needs some power :)
What is a permanent solution for black mold?

Once we got the water leak fixed we were left with the job of getting rid of the black mould spores on our wall. We found a fantastic mould spray that completely got rid of all the black mould spores and they haven't come back since.
How to moisturize lips on the go?
Just to add some points regarding long term prevention, rather than an immediate solution.You mention skin oils (sebum) as "gross". I would therefore guess that you are carefully washing your hair and face with shampoo, soap or other cleansers to keep them "oil-free and fresh". If you are female, you probably use make-up and other cosmetics on your face and also cleansers to take them off again (but at the minimum you seem to use lip balm).All of these things may alter the sebum production in your skin. I want you to realize that sebum in itself is your body's own totally natural way to keep your skin and hair healthy and clean and shiny. It is no more gross than the tears that keep your eyes moisturized and dust-free or the saliva that keeps your mucous membranes in your mouth moisturized and healthy and initiates your food digestion process :-) I don't think outside substances can effectively replace your body's own function (provided your body is in good health, of course).So I suggest to consider if any of your routines may be detrimental to your skin, and perhaps try to adjust them.Many people wash their hair (and face) with a weak bicarbonate of soda (a.k.a. baking soda, bicarb) solution followed by a rinse of diluted apple cider vinegar (ACV) or lemon juice, which strips away less sebum than soap does, and so normalizes sebum production after a while. You can google the exact procedure, but be aware that bicarb solution is still harsh, so dilute as much as possible and rinse out as quickly as possible. Others go even further and wash with only water. Keep in mind that your skin will need time to adjust and may overproduce for the first while (oily skin and hair with unpleasant body odor). There are ways to alleviate it (in the same articles). It does improve. Be warned however that you should not jump back and forth between methods, if you decide to do this, go all the way.Taking long baths or showers in hot/steamy water may also dry out your skin.Cosmetics may also dry out your skin especially moisturising products. Consider phasing them out. This may include some lib balm sticks, which may also actually dry out lips.As mentioned by others, stay hydrated. Drink water, but small quantities at regular intervals (e.g. half a glass every 15 mins) rather than big quantities at once.Be aware of what you eat. Some foods (e.g. sugars, refined (white) starches, processed foods, and heated or chemically-treated oils (like in fast food or cheap cooking oils) may cause your tissues (including skin) to become less than optimally healthy (unfortunately often typical student foods). Your diet should include lots of fresh (preferably raw) vegetables and fruits (mostly veggies, though). It should also include enough healthy fats (extra virgin olive oil, butter, avocados, etc.) with every meal. A moderate amount of red meat is probably good. Most modern diets or "eating lifestyles" like clean eating, paleo, banting, modernized Atkins, etc. are not too far off regarding general guidelines. (Eating healthy will also help in the body odor department, if you are worried about that).Iron deficiency may also cause dry skin. So again you should include at least small amounts of red meat, eggs etc. in your diet. And don't worry about the cholesterol in the foods, that recommendation is now deprecated.Regular vigorous exercise (working up a sweat) is also helpful in a number of ways. It improves blood circulation, gets the lymph system going which helps to detox, flushes out pores, and distributes sebum.Sorry for the long post, seems to have lost track into to a general health sermon, and you are worried about your lips only :-)

If you have to open those glasses more frequently, such a device could help you:It's a rubber band with a plastic lever arm, that fits on most common glasses:For occasional use, built one made of things you have at home, like a leather belt and a lever arm made of a hammer, a cane or a boomerang - you name it:Apply the force gently in order not to damage the belt. And maybe protect the hand that holds the glass with a glove or similar.
How to transport liquids without spilling?
I've recently tried this new approach, I have to walk 2 floors upstairs and I always spilled some of my coffee on my way up, I first tried making round movements with my holding hand and it seemed to work tough it wasn't good enough, so I tried a new approach by swinging the opposite arm, that way whenever I mark a step the hand is vertically aligned to my feet and the swinging and hand position absorb the shock of the step, I've found this myself useful as I can even walk upstairs a bit faster without spilling.

Keeping Sleep Apnea mask on
It's normal at the beginning to play with the c-pap mask. When you wake up, replace the mask.Soon, your body will "recognize" the better sleep you're getting, and it will become second-nature.NOTE: It's VERY important to make sure your gear as spotlessly clean as you can. Although it's expensive, if it isn't working it's worthless.Keep it up. You'll breath easier for it.
How can you cut fingernails and toenails without nail trimmings flying everywhere?
Don't need a lifehack actually, first one needs a good tool, this kind of tool is the best (it looks just like cutters for electrical wires, but small and with slightly bent blades):  Try better to cut the nail precisely so that after each cut it is still there, in the end you just pull the whole thing with fingers. With such cutters it is fairly easy. Before cutting, put the fingers in hot water for 5 min, it will make them soft.  Or cut the nails after bathing.   Put the hand/foot against wall/box/whatever which will prevent it from flying too far. To find them it easier, do it on a dark surface.Easy one, but works only for handnails - put black pants on, or a tissue over the knees while sitting and keep fingers against the tissue while cutting.
Keeping Sleep Apnea mask on
The core question is: what can I do about my somnambulism.(note: sleep walking is called somnambulism, but somnambulism is any motor activity during sleep, such as shutting down the CPAP)Taking of the mask (which with some models is tricky) and then turning off the CPAP, on more than one occasion would be diagnosed as somnambulism.Do you have a history of sleepwalking or doing odd things at night? Do you live alone and have no way of knowing your sleep activity? On one of my daughters visits she said I got out of bed, walked into the dining room, pushed a chair over, and then went back to bed.My Doc fixed my minor somnambulism with a diphenhydramine (aka Benadryl) before bed. Diphenhydramine is the active ingredient on Tylenol PM and the like products.BTW: always always use only distilled water in the humidifer
How can you cut fingernails and toenails without nail trimmings flying everywhere?
Clip your nails outside in nature. Your small organic compound deposit is appreciated by micro-organisms, and you don't have to care where it lands.Be courteous: don't do this where the scattered trimmings might bother others, such as in urban or built-up areas, or on grass likely to be used for picnics within the next year, or on public beaches, or near food-crops or sources of fresh water.
how to eat loud food (chips, celery) quietly
To me, this is more of a manners question, as crunchy foods are meant to be crunched.So, offer some chips (etc.) to your workmates before snacking. Explain they are welcome to any and apologize for any 'ravenous munchings' they might overhear from your cube. Then devour like a Cookie Monster. They'll find you charming & amusing. In my cube environ, I used to slowly pour my water from bottle to mug, gradually increasing the distance for volume, then topping it all off with little splooshing sounds. It's a great (rare occasion) groggy-Friday-afternoon activity that always got some giggles. Then I'd watch to see who was the first inspired to hit the bathroom.

Use an object or a surface which has same height as width of your hand. So whenever by mistake your elbow or hand hits it will push the surface towards the edge of the desk and the glass will fall towards the inside or away from the edge.Simple physics and conservation of momentum.

Your given dimensions sound almost like a representation of a Space Odyssey Monolith (1×4×9, or 1²×2²×3²). Is your secret society perhaps the Arthur C. Clarke Fan Club?  :-)Joking aside, an object of the size you described would perhaps be of the size of a key fob. I think it would be easy to simply add it to a key ring, perhaps with some cover like a leather or plastic sheath (perhaps with a car maker's logo), if camouflage is deemed necessary. Which leaves the problem of pickpocketing. What if you attach the key ring, or simply the token itself, to your clothing with a sufficiently strong chain? Either the normal devices that people use for their keys/wallets (unsightly), or more clandestinely: pinned to the inside of you pocket with something like a safety pin?A related idea is how gentlemen used to secure their pocket watches to their vests, which has gone out of fashion (except apparently in steampunk subculture). Around a decade ago I visited Switzerland and in a watch shop saw various models of wristwatch-sized pocket watches (both in a pocket watch housing, and mounted onto a leather backing instead of a wristband) that were apparently in fashion with some motorcyclists (carried in little denim "5th pocket"). So you could get away with disguising your token in such a housing (and affecting some eccentricity).In a stretch it could also be disguised as a (non-functional) smart watch. Flip up the face to reveal the token.I for one however am appalled that a society would use such an antiquated and still easy-to-steal security device (or they could at least have made it out of tungsten, titanium, cobalt, platinum, or some such). As 007 showed us in Spectre, even a small innocuous ring with an engraved octopus can still be pulled off its newly-deceased owner and used to gain entrance to the highest level meeting. Not a good idea. Perhaps your society should consider something more modern like a subdermal microchip implant which can implement the whole public/private key spiel, even without the need to keep a members' list on a central computer, and potentially making the bouncer's job easier or even redundant.
How can you cut fingernails and toenails without nail trimmings flying everywhere?
I know that nail clipper manufacturers in Japan have tried to mitigate this problem with an addition to the nail clipper.As you can see, they have included a plastic guard and sleeve on the sides of the clipper where the nails would usually fly out. The clippings are collected in the sleeve which can be removed. You can then dump the clippings out after your are done.Here is a better image that shows the design.If you combine this nail clipper with the plastic bag method, you'll be in business.

Avoiding view of vest in T-shirt
A sando vest is a vest, in UK terminology, that is, a garment worn next to the skin, underneath other clothing, either short sleeved or with a straplike cut of varying widths over the shoulders, worn usually for warmth. Choose a different style of vest - there are differences in the cut which make the strap parts over your shoulders rest in different areas over the shoulders, so choosing one with narrower straps, set further apart, is about the only thing you can do. Or stop wearing a vest under your teeshirt - if its warm enough to wear a teeshirt, surely its warm enough to not need a vest beneath. If you're female, a camisole top is better, they have really narrow straps, but again, where the straps sit on the shoulders differs with the cut of the garment.
How can you cut fingernails and toenails without nail trimmings flying everywhere?

Given the size and (presumed) rigidity of your membership tag, and your criterion that there can't be a trail such as a neck chain (dog tags don't really stand out, and a lot of folks who exercise regularly carry a car key and/or house key that way), many easy hiding places are ruled out.  Protection against pickpockets makes the task harder still, nixing a wallet or just carrying loose in a pocket.Needing to be able to show the item on short notice, and restow it quickly and easily, further narrows things down.  If you're willing to go to considerable effort and expense, you might be able to have a body modification shop create a skin pouch (say, on one of your pectorals) where the outline of the item would be covered by your body, but the pouch would be accessible through an open shirt collar (not so good for black tie, but fine for shirt and trousers).Otherwise, if your mouth is big enough (might be marginal, depending on the harshness of the item's corners and edges) you could conceal it in one cheek (preferably inside a protective covering to prevent corrosion and irritation of cheek and gums).  More accessible, no more available to pickpockets, and probably cheaper than a skin pouch.  This one would be greatly simplified if your item were just a little smaller.Failing in-body methods, modification of your pants to give an access hole inside one pocket would allow a man to store an item this size inside jockey shorts or bikini briefs, in the perineal area.  The doorman probably won't want to touch it if you store it here...
How can i prevent a drinking glass from getting knocked over?
The first think I would think of if I want a glass that does not spill when knocked over is one of the Thermoses used for drinks like Coffee. They have lids that require pressing a button or using some other mechanism to open, so most can not let liquid out without human intervention or not being closed after drinking. Even for some of them the hole is small which limits the amount that can spill when knocked over. They are designed like this to keep the heat in, keeping Coffee hot longer. You can use that to your advantage as well by putting ice in there and it is sure to stay cold for a long time.

How can I neutralize the odor of Tide washing detergent?
I've tried everything and I find soaking clothes in warm water and Calgon Water Softener (found it at Walmart near the oxyclean) for about a day works  well to get detergent smell out of used clothing.  Sometimes I'll add a little dish soap too if they are really strong. Then I rinse them well and wash with my regular laundry soap.  Seems to release the smells without adding another one, the light Calgon smell rinses away.  It's a little gross to see how much stinky detergent/fabric softener "film" rises to the top of the soaking water.  I think the Calgon removes the binding agents or hard water minerals that hold onto the fragrance and the dish soap de-greases the fabric softener.

Use nail clippers and trim your nails 98% of the way across. Once all the clipping is done use your opposite fingers to break little bits of attached nail and drop them in a bin somewhere. 
How can you cut fingernails and toenails without nail trimmings flying everywhere?
Assuming you are using clippers like these, all you have to do is run them under water for a second and clip like usual. The water causes the nails to stick to the metal in a nice small bundle. After you are done, just run it under water again to clean the nails out.
How can you cut fingernails and toenails without nail trimmings flying everywhere?
File the nails down rather than clipping them.  Motorized foot files (like Amope's products, intended for removing calluses) do a good job, as does a rotary tool (e.g. Dremel) with an appropriate abrasive.  This method allows for easy shaping of the nail and is also much easier than clipping if you have thick nails.

Tetsujin's answer about it being on your epiglottis and trachea, on the way to your lungs, is probably right.

How can i prevent a drinking glass from getting knocked over?
There is a product called 'Spink' by Dreamfarm. Silly name notwithstanding, it seems do exactly what you need: provide a little guard for a cup or mug and suctions onto a table to prevent being knocked over.I own one and it works as advertised. My only complaint with it is how the suction needs to be reapplied to the table every other day, but that takes about two seconds to do.Disclaimer: I have no stake in the company, nor do I know anybody who works there. I was given this as a gift from a friend who knows I like to have my drink around delicate electronics.
How can I dim the 20+ LEDs that are in my room to help with sleep?
I have a lot of annoying blue leds in my room too. I've covered most of mine with black electrical tape -- its very opaque and doesn't let any light through. For the LEDs that I still like to see sometimes during the day, I'll poke a small hole in the electrical tape, sort of to the side of the focus of the LED (where the led is less bright) so I can still check the status of the device without having the oppressive brightness at night. If you want to just dim the led, you can actually stretch the electrical tape very thin. It'll start letting light through at a certain point. Just pull it apart like taffy, cut it to the desired size, and stick it on. You could probably use white electrical tape as well, which would let a little more light through.For mobile devices that I don't want to have decked out with tape, I charge them under my bed at night. It's simple, but it works to keep the LEDs out of view (especially if your bed has a bed skirt) 
Body temperature, without a thermometer?
MaterialsStopwatchIce cubes of the same volumeMeasurement toolSilicone ice tray (or maybe a greased up plastic one)AccuracyThis test will be highly inaccurate because of all of the environmental factors that interfere, so try to limit them as best you can. You will need to have a freezer that freezes ice cubes at the same temperature reliably, a way to make sure ice cubes are going to have the same mass like a graduated syringe or tablespoon, a silicone ice tray to avoid chipping the cubes, and an AC unit would also help. Depending on your city, tapwater can be inconsistent with what's in it, so you might want to consider using purified water of the same brand. Don't try to measure this way after eating. Don't do this test repeatedly. If anyone can think of any other factors that may interfere, please either edit this post to add them or comment with them.ProcedureWhen you have a normal body temperature, take an ice cube and place it in your mouth. Without moving the ice cube around, measure how long it takes for it to disappear. This time will be your normal body temperature, so make sure to record it for later use. When you believe you have a fever, make a new set of ice cubes with the same mass. Don't try to store the same ice cubes for several days and think they're going to have the same mass. Measure how long it takes for you to melt the new ice cubes. If it takes less time, your body temperature is higher.SafetyKeep in mind that you're putting ice in your mouth and keeping it in the same spot. Don't fill up your ice tray all the way, make the ice cube a small nugget to avoid freezer burn. Additionally, do not use this method as the way to get your temperature, use it as a fun experiment. You will have to make sure you don't have a dangerous fever with a real thermometer. You won't be able to get other peoples temperatures by comparing the time it takes for them to melt the ice cube with the time it takes for you to melt an ice cube.
How to make yourself stop grinding your teeth during the day (without a guard)?
Have you looked into the reason why you do it?For me I have it during the night when I am over worked or stressed.Other than that I would:Not lean on your jaw (elbow on something, jaw in hand)Avoid or cut back on foods and drinks that contain caffeine, such as colas, chocolate, and coffee.Avoid alcohol. Grinding tends to intensify after alcohol consumption.Do not chew on pencils or pens or anything that is not food. Avoid chewing gum as it allows your jaw muscles to get more used to clenching and makes you more likely to grind your teeth.-Train yourself not to clench or grind your teeth. If you notice that you clench or grind during the day, position the tip of your tongue between your teeth. This practice trains your jaw muscles to relax.Relax your jaw muscles at night by holding a warm washcloth against your cheek in front of your earlobe.NOTEThese are mostly treatments for night time teeth grinding and so on. This might help for the daytime part.Teeth grinding/clenching is unusually common in high stress professions.Clenching seems to be a natural human response to stress, but in those who are unusually susceptible to stress or who have highly stressful careers, this natural response can go very bad. Like grinding, clenching can lead to enamel degradation, tension headaches, jaw pain, and even tooth breaking or cracking.There are however, other options to protect your teeth from daytime clenching. Some dental clinics and online retailers offer extra thin acrylic mouth guards that not only allow speech but are so thin and discrete as to be nearly unnoticeable when worn. Without any speech impediment or visual evidence, these ultra fine mouth guards can help protect your enamel and cushion your jaw from the intense force.

How can I work out my girlfriend's ring size, without asking her or using a ring?
Get some plaster and a shallow rectangular box. Get her to make a hand print. It has to be a deep one - you want her to insert her hand into the plaster far enough that the plaster envelops the widest part of her ring finger (i.e. the joint).  This gives you the width of her ring finger. A totally nonscientific test on my own finger shows that width and height of the finger are similar, so this should get you pretty close.

How to avoid bad smells from using dishwasher
It's often described as smelling of "washed dog"As far as I'm aware it's a bacteria build up & is really difficult to get rid of. Simply putting the things back through another wash, as you've discovered, doesn't do it.Commercial dishwasher cleaners work up to a point, as do low-odour anti-bacterials, & even vinegar - but what you will probably find is that you actually need to get in there & clean the machine properly beforehand.Any regular kitchen surface cleaner will do for the removable components. I use Dettox, which is a low odour anti-bacterial cleaner, available from any supermarket in the UK. Your market will likely have something similar.There should be removable filter elements in the bottom of the appliance. Take these out & clean thoroughly. Don't get any cleaning product or other contaminant in the salt container - you can damage the water softener permanently - in fact, leave it closed, once you've established that the lid & screw thread are clean by rinsing in hand-hot water.  Next, you will find the rubber strip that seals the door when closed is likely to also be removable - that's the culprit that everybody misses.Once you've got it clean, reassemble & run a dishwasher cleaner in an otherwise unloaded machine, on as hot/long a cycle as it will go.Only after that is it worth trying to get the smell from all the dishes.Once it has built up over a few days/weeks & been stacked away in the cupboard, you may find the only real solution is to wash the whole darn lot, several times.Especially in warm weather, use the commercial cleaner once a month - before you notice the smell again - & keep the removable components clean too. It's the particulate matter stuck in the filters & seals that seems to be the key to the whole thing.Further note:Avoid running the rinse-only setting, especially in summer. Essentially what that does is leaves you with a warm box full of stagnant water. It's less environmentally-friendly, but rinsing things individually to remove the main detritus from the crockery before putting it in the machine is going to keep it cleaner longer.

Part marked as 'citation needed' however I just discovered this on Wikipedia doing a totally unrelated search. Three potential workarounds, as prevention rather than cure...The reaction with moisture can cause a container of glue which has been opened and resealed to become unusable more quickly than if never opened.  To minimise this reduction in shelf life cyanoacrylate, once opened, can be stored in an airtight container with a package of silica gel desiccant.  Another technique is to insert a hypodermic needle into the opening of a tube. After using the glue, residual glue soon clogs the needle, keeping moisture out. The clog is removed by heating the needle (e.g. with a lighter) before use.[citation needed].  The polymerisation is also temperature-dependant: storage at zero degrees or below stops it, so keeping it in the freezer is also effective.Source: Wikipedia : Cyanoacrylate

Never falls over up there, but I'm guessing it might if you have sliding doors on your cabinet.
What's the best way to prevent water from collecting underneath a soap bar?
"The best" is unanswerable, but any object that raises the soap out of any pooled water and lets air circulate on all sides will do the job. I currently use a plastic disk originally intended for holding toys to the sides of a tub; it has many small suction cups on each side, with space between them that allow airflow. I've seen "palm combs" used for the purpose; the many points spread across the surface should do the same thing. A small brush could work. Something with a corrugated surface could work. A grill of some sort. And so on. .Another solution I've seen is a funnel-like holder which lets water drain away. That works better mounted to the wall of a shower than on a sink, I think.The same basic principle applies in all cases: lift the soap off the wet surface, support it with minimum contact.
What's the best way to prevent water from collecting underneath a soap bar?
You can try putting a sponge in the soap dish and placing the soap on the sponge.  The sponge performs 2 functions: it raises the soap above any collected water and it absorbs water from the soap.

Keep deodorant container/bottle from always falling in cabinet?
Top-heavy narrow containers are not limited to deodorant, many face creams and make-up foundations work the same way. A solution we used in the in the past was to store them in narrow basket-like shelves on the inside of the cabinet doors (similar to those in refrigerator doors); we had even one shelf that we'd added a narrow bungee-cord type of string above the original edge for especially tall containers. As the shelf was so narrow, the containers could only tip left or right and typically the shelves were so full that that didn't matter. If your cabinets have a different interior layout, look into spice racks (random example), mounted inside or outside the cabinet. You might want to add a solid bottom instead of a wire one and then it can also house smaller containers from pill bottles to nail polish or those blood stopper sticks (depending on your cosmetic requirements). Great for coralling all those knick-knacks that tends to play domino on bathroom shelves.

How do I get rid of burning toothpaste in my throat?
Toothpaste is not made for ingesting . Some of the substances in toothpaste are potentially toxic.Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a related detergent used in cosmetics, is a skin, eye and respiratory tract irritant and toxic to aquatic organisms.  The extensive use of triclosan in consumer products may contribute to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Triclosan can pass through skin i and is suspected of interfering with hormone function (endocrine disruption).Triclosan is used mainly in antiperspirants/deodorants, cleansers, and hand sanitizers as a preservative and an anti-bacterial agent. In addition to cosmetics, triclosan is also used as an antibacterial agent in laundry detergent, facial tissues, and antiseptics for wounds, as well as a preservative to resist bacteria, fungus, mildew and odors in other household products that are sometimes advertized as "anti-bacterial." These products include garbage bags, toys, linens, mattresses, toilet fixtures, clothing, furniture fabric, and paints. Triclosan also has medical applications.

Studies on jojoba oil show that it has the ability to prevent skin from becoming too oily. This is due to the fact that putting jojoba oil on our skin can trick our cells into thinking they have produced enough oil. Remove any surface dirt from your skin, then put just a few drops of jojoba oil into your hand and rub it into your skin when you start to work jojoba oil into the skin, the oil penetrates into the pores. As jojoba closely resembles your skin's own oil, moisturizing with jojoba oil sends the message to your pores to stop overproducing the sebum that causing the oily skin.Source : Blackheads

Depending on the size of the head opening, i usually find a sharp stanley knife will allow you to cut out the solid glue enough so you can use the contents again.But yea if its really bad, get your smallest drill bit out, sometimes even a mini screwdriver will do the trick and is quicker then setting up a drill.

Prevent Smelly Sponges
I use a suction cup mounted bar-soap holder. The sort you'd normally find stuck on a wall in a shower. Stick this to the near-side wall IN your sink. The holder and sponge are then out of sight, and the sponge gets plenty of air to drip dry quickly.There are several other bonuses: You do not have to wring/rinse the sponge multiple times attempting to prevent it smelling; This leaves a bit of soap in the sponge, saving some soap for the next use. You do not drip water/soap on your counter/floor trying to put the sponge away to dry; You just drop it into the holder.

Keeping valuables safe whilst in costume
Get something that is generically known as a "running belt".These things are fantastic; everyone should have one. They wrap around your waist or hips, and you can wear them under just about anything.Whenever pockets are not ideal or completely absent (running, cycling, beachwear, costumes, too much to carry, pockets too bulky, hiding cash, etc…), these things are a lifesaver. And if you frequent water/theme parks where your phone might get wet, they even come in a waterproof version.Product Search: Running Belt
How to get rid of smell from kitchen trash?
There are two reasons your kitchen trash bins could be smelling:The most obvious is (1) the smell of the trash. Most kitchen trash bins are very large; I find when living alone it takes me a week to fill it up. By the end of the week, the items I threw in the trash during the beginning of the week have began to develop an odor.Switch out your large kitchen bin for a smaller one that you can fit "regular" grocery bags into, which means you fill the trash bag up faster, and naturally taking the trash out to the dumpster or the large "outdoor container" more often.If you have something that smells or will quickly develop a smell (fish, meats, old food that has been sitting in the fridge too long), take out the trash immediately after throwing the item away.The second, much more overlooked source of trash smell in the kitchen is (2) the smell of the trash bin itself. Give the trash bin a thorough scrub with dish soap and water every now and then, and clean the floor area and walls right around the trash bin regularly. Often, small pieces of food or fluids that you don't even notice get stuck to those areas and build up a smell.Several answers have already given great suggestions on how to reduce the odor of the trash bin itself, including cat litter, and avoiding putting liquids in the trash that may leak into the bin.

If your colsplay clothing allows for it, find the pouches that hang around your neck, and and are worn underneath your clothing.Image taken from KevinCoffey.com, though, it's unclear if the website's owners hold the copyright, or if the image is from elsewhere.These are often advertised for travelers or people going through airports. It keeps your valuables safe from pickpockets, and with most cosplay outfits, it should be possible to easily pull out the pouch when you need something important.I'm mostly finding brand names and trade marks while trying to search for these, but the generic name seems to be security neck pouch or security neck wallet and are between $8.00 and $20.00.

When doing "cosplay" myself, I have put some flat items such as money & drivers license in plastic slipcovers or plastic bags, and put them in the bottom of my shoes before putting my shoes on my feet. There is not much room but for just a few flat items it does the trick.
How do I remove a musty smell from my books?
The musty smell of paper is very hard to remove. You could try a method that has proved effective, for me, personally. You cannot wash the book nor scrub the smell out of it without damaging the pages. Spraying deodorants or fragrance sprays will mostly corrode the pages also. So what can you do? Why don't you try Camphor.What is Camphor?Camphor is a waxy, flammable, white or transparent solid with a strong aroma.Camphor has a very pleasant smell and most importantly, it readily sublimes to its vapor state, thereby leaving the pleasant smell around the air it sublimes too. You could keep camphor near the books and within a few days, it should absorb the smell and the book should be rid of the musty smell. You might have to replace the sublimed camphor with fresh ones, and do this multiple times. The musty smell will pertain, but it will not be so intense and should cease to bother you. Camphor is flammable, but it is not very volatile. So it causes no harm to the books by catching on fire. However, I would advice you to keep it away from direct sunlight. Camphor needs fresh air to sublime into its vapor. So keep the books in a well aerated room. The fresh air should also help in removing the musty smell. Also, you could try Incense Sticks.  They give out a very good aroma and is often used to remove unwanted smell off the air. But, they are not available everywhere. If you are in Asia, you will have no difficluty find either, as camphor and incense sticks are used extensively. The only drawback for the incense sticks in that, it must burn continuesly. This brings in the risk of the book being damaged, if they are kept too close to each other. If you could get a few incense sticks and set them on one part of the room, away from the book, and also camphor around the book, the book should be rid of the musty smell in a while. It will take a while to see the results, or rather smell the results. But it should work, give it a shot.
How do I avoid ants from eating up all my sweets?
What my mom does is this:Put the sweets in one container or box (plastic/metal/glass)Take a plate or bowl that has some depth (at least 1.5 - 2inch) Also make sure the base of this plate or bowl is wider than the sweets container, such that their ends don't touch at all.Fill this plate/bowl (about 3/4th) with water.Now place the container of sweets in this water filled plate/bowl. We do this regularly at home. Ants have never got to the sweets since then.Oh and the good thing about this method is you don't have to you any other ingredient due to which you will lose the original aroma of sweets. Enjoy!

How to remove bicycle oil/grease from waxed jacket
You can try applying talcum powder/french chalk - it's lipophilic, combines with the oil or grease and can be brushed off.  If the lubricant stain has hardened, you may need to soften it first with a hair dryer, or by working in a tiny amount of paraffin wax.  Then sprinkle the area liberally with talc and work it in with your fingers.  Leave it for an hour ot two, and then brush it off with a stiff clothes brush.  It may take a few applications, or leaving it on for longer - you'll have to experiment. Finally sponge it over with cold water and rewax when dry if needed.

I'll concentrate on the bulky item—the phone.Buy, rent, borrow, or steal a safety pin. They come in various sizes and styles. You can paint one if it clashes with your improvisation; so, it will go with your intensions no matter how discerning your critics may be.Slip your phone into either one of the pockets of your costume, get-up, attire, clothing, ensemble, garb, uniform, livery, togs, apparel, gear, or what have you and pin your pocket shut.Here's the good part. When you want your phone, undo the pin and retrieve your equipment. When you have finished using your phone, put it back into your pocket and REUSE the same pin to safely store your phone on your person again.NO SEWING is necessary or required at any pointYou can use this procedure as often as you want so long as you don't lose your pin, phone, or pants.Really, if something like this drives you to seek help…

How to get cat urine smell out of wooden floors?
The operative chemical in cat urine is ammonia. Bleach (hypochlorite) chemically reacts with ammonia and will destroy it. Don't breath the ammonium chloride gas that is produced because it is poisonous.Unfortunately, this is really only a partial solution because usually the piss will be in unreachable areas so the smell will still be there.The ultimate solution which is used by professionals is to ozone bomb the house. You seal the house up and run an ozone machine in it for 24 hours. This will neutralize every smell in the house including cat urine. Ozone is bad for various things so it is best if the house is empty when this is done.

You could also use a pin or similar-sized pointy object and heat it up (ideally with a lighter) and push the hot tip through the dried glue/nozzle. This has helped me on more than one occasion with minimal damage and spills.
Dirty mouse of dried cream
I get the idea of having a moisturized skin, but whenever you're gonna use your mouse wash your hands first, just to make sure you get rid off of any oily substances from the cream. To clean the exterior of your mouse, I'd suggest isopropilic alcohol, as for the interior of your mouse, well I can't really suggest you any approach without compromising your device's integrity. I can however -as an owner of a razer mouse- suggest you to use a presentation card/piece of paper folded at least 3 times(to give it sturdiness) to clean the edges every 3-4 days if you use it daily, this will reduce the chances of any excess of cream getting stuck inside your mouse. NOTE: There are also creams that are less oily while providing the same level of moisturizing effect.So if washing your hands before gaming isn't an option, you can always just find the perfect moisturizer for your needs.

How can I fix these suspenders?
Try substituting two split key rings and a snap.Here's a sketch I had fun making to give you an idea of what I had in mind. I'd guess that 1-1/4" diameter rings should work. It's not ideal but the materials should be easy to find and you could make two so that they'd match. They'll lie flat against your body. The adjustment buckle should take up the slack.Another idea was to use a small "S" shaped carabiner which is easy to attach and relatively flat against your body.
How to clean a key guard?
That appears to be some type of semi-transparent vinyl material or something closely related. Whether it is literally vinyl or not, the chemical composition that makes the vinyl clear and flexible is what also renders the material less resistant to discoloration and UV damage. The gradual loss of transparency over time is due to bodily oils, light, and particularly sunlight.That type of damage is not reversible from a practical standpoint. Preventative measures include limiting the installation time to minimize light exposure (not practical), and to wipe the surface with a non-abrasive cloth after use using a gentle, highly diluted detergent like dish soap mixed with lots of water. Either measure isn't terribly practical for a low-budget item that is designed to be convenient for day-in and day-out use. An occasional, light cleaning will help, but in practical terms, I would consider this a disposable item you use until it no longer suits your needs… and then replace it.
How do I repel bugs from face
Look for a Bug-net mesh hat or head-covering.Most come attached to a broad stiff-rimmed hat. A hoop holds the mesh away from your skin to keep stinging insects from piercing you through the mesh.A few are unstructured and can slip on over your bare head, a cap, or bonnet. They are available with different mesh sizes from extremely fine (that are hard to see through in sunlight) to coarse (that let you see great but don't stop the no-see-ums that get into your eyes when your hands are dirty or carrying nitroglycerine over gravel.
Keeping small containers cool on long trip
Consider double-bagging your things for the trip.My first impulse is to put the containers loosely in their own bag and zip/seal it shut. Put the sealed bag into a larger bag with the ice or a few frozen water-bottles. Separate frozen water bottles might be less liable to leak than loose ice cubes although they'll still get wet from condensation.Put the whole thing into another waterproof bag.An additional bag is a cheap precaution against a leak. Putting the supplements into their own container reduces the chance of a leak due to pressure of water pushing into the bag.Loose ice cubes have the advantage that they can probably be purchased at the same time as the supplements and can be packed around the containers. Frozen water bottles have the advantage of ease of handling for the round-trip and reduced chance of leakage.Try an experiment to see which alternative gives the best compromise while remaining cool enough to preserve your investment.
Keeping small containers cool on long trip
To keep your items cool over 5 to 6 hours you may need an insulating thermal bag designed to keep content at their temperature a bit longer than from a conventional bag. Such bags may be available at your grocery store, at a pharmacy, or even from a Pizza delivery service.To additionally cool your items I would go for a gel ice pack rather than ice cubes because of the gel preventing leakage. These ice packs need pre-cooling in a freezer before use. Apart from that I would check whether your vitamins and supplements are allowed to be transported at room temperature for a few hours. There are only very few substances that would suffer from such a short interruption of the cold chain.
How to remove marks from skin?
In short, no. However there things you can do to help it heal.Keep it moisturised.Sunlight. Sunlight in moderation will help provide the energy to help it heal. Excessive sunlight is bad for the skin.Time. Skin is constantly falling off - heck, inside most dust is human skin, so give it time to heal. We all heal at different speeds. Despite this, 3 months is a long time though - are you anaemic? Your age is important here as we heal fastest when young. Stop smoking, and stop drinking alcohol as they reduce the oxygen around the body meaning your skin receives less. Don't seek medical advice on the internet though.If you are really concerned then speak to a nurse / pharmacist.
How to prevent my socks from becoming dry and rigid?
You need to add fabric softener to your washing steps, after using the detergent fill up the laundry machine with water again and pour the instructed quantity of fabric softener, let the laundry do its job and after it has finished its cycle then take them to the dryer, hanging them to dry is another factor for this hard/rough/unpleasant situation. If you add fabric softener and use a dryer I can assure you you'll have fluffy socks for longer time.NOTE: Washing machines usually have predefined cycles that include the fabric softener step.

Best (law-abiding) ways to inconvenience cold callers?
Most telephone companies have procedures to identify equipment status.One is an automated series of tones to identify a line that is not-in-service.Most telemarketers use automated dialling that connects the caller with the callee after the connection has been made, verified, dialled, ringing, and then answered.Downloading and recording the tones from a not-in-service line at the beginning of your telephone message will immediately re-direct the telemarketers calling equipment.You can search for the tones specific for your telephone company online.In most cases, a not-in-service number is immediately taken off the telemarketer's active number list and placed into a secondary database to be tried in the future after a fixed delay. Telephone numbers are never taken off the list of numbers good for a particular zone.
Get the phone system to automatically call me back?
I don't see it specified whether it's a cell, landline, or VOiP phone you're asking about, but my general answer should work for all three: call yourself from another phone.  If a cell phone, take it somewhere you can use a phone (there are still pay phones in larger cities; in the USA, they're often outside convenience stores that sell international cellular reload cards and burner phones).  If you let the cell phone ring a time or two and then hang up the pay phone, many pay phones will (or at least used to) return the coins you deposited.If not a cell phone, call from your cell phone where you can hear the landline or VOiP phone ring or, ideally, answer it and hear your own voice coming back through the connection.
How do I remove a musty smell from my books?
The smell could be mildew/mold.One thing that works for mildew is sunlight; perhaps leaving the books in a sunny place, like a (dry) conservatory, might help; perhaps fanned open.Of course, there's a danger of fading, if they're left in sun too long.If it's very bad, make sure that you keep them away from other things that could become "infected" by the spores, e.g. clothes.

How can I react to an acne, without getting any marks on my face?
In my Case, Skin Care Products didn't made my skin better. But cleaning the skin with water and pealing is a good thing to avoid acne. My Solution is based on a healthy nutrition. I made the experience, that my acne increases when my body try to get rid of "bad" substances (fat, alcohol etc.) and my disgestion didn't work very well. So i try to eat vegetables with every meal and chew them quiet well to support my digestion. additionally I use healing earth before i go to bed (this binds toxic substances). I support my liver by ingesting holy thistle pill (I translated that from German "Mariendistel"- hope its correct) after greasy meals. Good luck with your acne or pimple.

Same as any other electronics.Buy some low percentage rubbing alcohol, 70% or so, and soak the whole thing for about 20 minutes. Rubbing alcohol is not conductive.Buy a gallon of distilled water. Soak and swish around in the water. Distilled water is not conductive - it's the dissolved solids and minerals in tap water that make it conduct.Dry it out. Put it in a bag with rice and point a lamp at it so it gets warm without melting anything and leave it there for a day or so.

How to remove marks from skin?
This is a minor problem and can easily be remedied in less than half-an-hour.The tendency of the skin to darken with injury is referred to as "marking." As long as the skin is darker than your normal skin colour it is a relatively easy procedure to lighten the skin pigments using an intense pulsed laser by a dermatologist, skin treatment specialist, or a cosmetic surgeon. The specific wavelength of laser that is used has been used successfully for many years. It is not a new concept. The laser is very superficial and its effect is almost immediate. It is a painless procedure. A short (probably free) consultation visit to the doctor's office will confirm this.

Buy something in a department store and ask them to look after your bag till you go home. Put your other stuff in the bag too.I have often done this in the old days of dead-tree books.
How do I remove a musty smell from my books?
Pages over time absorb moisture and depending on storage can get wonky over time. If the book is leather-bound, you can try polishing the book cover but the smell from the pages will still remain.If anything you can try putting the book in a gallon zip-lock bag/container(container is pref since its air tight) and add a mix of silica gel and laundry freshner beads. Both are pebble sized solids so you shouldnt have any issue wiping them off the book after. For best results, leave the book inside the bag/container covered for a few days. If you are worried about the pages being stained, wrap the book once with mesh or cotton gauze, since both leave enough space for air to filter through but the beads of silica and laundry freshner to be blocked.
How to prevent my socks from becoming dry and rigid?
Are you using your socks for other activities non-foot related that might cause them to become rigid and dry?There are a few factors to this equation:1-The quality of the sock itself. The fabric used to make the sock may be a thin blend. 2- Dryer setting is too high. Some people I know just throw everything into the dryer at once like savages and the setting for the dryer is is too high causing shrinkage and stiffness.3-Depending on your location, your water may have different impurities impacting your fabrics (May not be the case if your other articles of clothing are coming out fine).
How to keep my phone number private, when I have to provide a way for students to contact me?
Set up a throw-away e-mail address (gmail, yahoo, aol, etc.).  Then set up automatic forwarding on the server to your cell phone's text message address.  If the server doesn't support this, a mail client on a home or office computer can do the same job using automatic message retrieval and message rule filters.You'll get whatever the students send in minutes, and can respond quickly if needed, but the address they have can be shut down at the end of the term, if you think that's necessary, and replaced by a newer one.They can contact you as easily from a phone as from a computer by this method, but your phone won't ring in the middle of the night (providing you can turn off automatic text message retrieval).You can also set up forwarding in reverse to facilitate responding my text message, but unless you have software to strip the headers from your response, a tech-savvy student might be able to extract your private number from the email headers. Recommended response method (for best security) would be via web-mail, which you can do from your phone's web browser, or by voice from a school phone or with blocked caller ID.
Cheap Method to Extract Oil
Normally, oils are extracted from vegetable material using various combinations of temperature and pressure during a distillation process.Oily materials can be squeezed directly. A Walnut can be rubbed vigorously on a walnut wood surface and the oil from the walnut will infuse into the wood.Some materials must be put into a solution to dissolve the oils in the material and the solution is then distilled to separate the desireable oil from the more volatile solvent. Recovering the solvent for re-use is part of a continuous extraction process otherwise it is discarded ($). The solvent cannot be water as it won't dissolve the oils in the material.

If it doesn't have to be a phone number, you could set up a private google group. One of my professors used to do this. It allowed us to contact him without giving out his personal information. It also allowed students to  discuss ideas and answer each others questions (if you helped another student it counted towards your class participation grade). It can be accessed from a computer or a smartphone and at the end of each semester he could delete the group. You also have options for how often you get notifications (manage the student who posts/sends hundreds of messages):Choose how frequently you get email from the group: Click the drop-down menu on the line below your email address. You can choose any of the following options.  Don't send email updates: You won't get emails, but you can still  see posts by logging in to Google Groups and clicking on that group. Send daily summaries: On days when people post to the group, you'll  only get one email that includes every message that was sent.     Send combined updates: You'll get one email for every 25 posts to  the group.     Send me an email for every new message: You'll get an  email anytime someone posts to the group.Source: Group membership settings
How to prevent my socks from becoming dry and rigid?
Use liquid detergent and use the recommended amount. Usually the first line on the inside of the cap. In the rinse cycle use a 1/4 cup of vinegar to help dissolve any excess soap. Vinegar serves 3 purposes: As a de-greaser, deodorizer, and poor man's fabric softener. Too much laundry detergent doesn't rinse out completely and a result when it dries it becomes stiff.

How to prevent an automatic toilet from flushing while I'm still using it?
The sensor on an automatic flush toilet uses the same principle as a motion detector. The two sensors detect body heat (infra red) in close proximity. If the signals are the same nothing happens. If you remain still the sensors don't react. When you move one sensor detects a change and triggers the flush mechanism. Ambient temp also affects these devices as well.If the room is extremely hot these devices don't function well at all and won't flush. In cooler rooms these devices react very fast because of a greater differential in temp.

Someone locked their bike to mine - now what?
Can you use a "spare" lock to attach your bike to theirs with a telephone # or other contact information?With your lock securing both bikes to the bike rack, you have a much better chance to meet the person to exchange "favours" when they're ready to leave with their bike.It's not convenient; but, there's a chance you'll get back the bike and the lock, too. You'll be able to assess the damage caused by the double-locking if any. There's a good possibility that they also don't carry power tools; but, there're no guarantees."Double-locked" is in pretty stable condition. That should give you a bit of time to point it out to the police who may have an agreeable solution to your current stalemate.

How to prevent my socks from becoming dry and rigid?
Use LESS detergentThe detergent has stiffened the fibres of your clothing. Bending stiffened fibres will weaken and eventually break them. The life span of the clothing has been compromised. A dryer will hasten the process. That's the first problem you asked about. There's more.Ahhh should be Argh! ! !If you can still smell your soap/detergent after your clothes are completely rinsed, something is wrong. If you can't completely rinse, You're using too much.CUT BACK on the amount until you cannot smell the cleaning agents. The manufacturers have ADDED an odour to your wash. How can adding something clean it? It's bait and switch for your nose.You are not sick to feel you are folding paperboard. You are poisoning yourself with the chemicals from the overexposure to the pthalate impregnated socks you're wearing.
Someone locked their bike to mine - now what?
If the other bike is only chained to your bike and nor the bike rack,  unchain your bike and take the whole lot home. Possibly leave a note for the other bike owner, but I'd be inclined to let them suck eggs! Once you have the bikes at home, use whatever tools you need to unchain the second bike (grinder, hacksaw etc.) and then hand it in to the local police station.
Someone locked their bike to mine - now what?
It's probably an unfortunate mistake. You can either wait until the other owner arrives or your bike will be spending the night there. It probably isn't worth the time an effort to try to break the lock.

There's a small chance this is malicious - is the other bike nice or a cheap junker?   Don't take your lock off and leave it with only their lock attached, else the bike could be stolen by other-bike-owner, or any miscreant that wanders through.Though most likely Hanlon's razor applies:never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity
How can I react to an acne, without getting any marks on my face?
You might not have acne. It might be something similar such as rosacea.Here are some skin conditions often confused with acne:Acne look alikesWhile what you eat has more to do with your general health than what you eat specifically, here are a few things associated with skin eruptions.Excessive Sugar intake will push your body to produce insulin. Cut back on simple carbohydrates and sweet drinks and snacks. Try cutting Dairy. Supplement your calcium with green leafy veggies. If that works, try introducing a little non-sweetened yogurt from cows or from other animals such as goat. See how that goes.Oils and Fats can be a problem. Corn, safflower, and canola oil can be problematic. Increase fish rich in omega-3s such as salmon and mackerel.It's trendy to look at gluten even if you don't have celiac disease. A lot of nutritious foods have gluten including whole wheat bread. Chat with a nutritionist about the pros and cons.
How can I react to an acne, without getting any marks on my face?
The best way to deal with acne is to stop it before it starts. Once it does you just have to ride it out. Getting stressed about it makes it worse as does physically aggravating it. Drink lots of water and use a cleanser with salicylic acid at least once a day, maybe twice. It's a good treatment, but it can dry out your face so applying moisturizer/sunscreen is a good move as well.
How to keep my phone number private, when I have to provide a way for students to contact me?
One way that I know which always worked for me no matter what and still to this day forward is the "textPlus" app from the Android playstore. With that app I am able to use real looking numbers with my area code. So when I text/call people they think its a legit number. You can choose any area code number from any state region within the USA and if I am not mistaken I think some other countries as well such as Canada. 
How to get rid of sorting and losing socks after laundry?
You already mentioned what I consider the best solution, which is buying a large number of the same pair of socks.This still works when laundry for several people is combined, as long as everyone picks a different model / colour sock.So Alice likes white socks, Bob like his black socks with Acme logo, Carol has black socks without a logo, and Dave has white socks with a red stripe. When it comes to sorting the laundry, the only sorting needed is socks per person, which needs to be done for all other laundry as well (Carol doesn't want to wear Bob's shirts).
How to get rid of sorting and losing socks after laundry?
I have several pairs of two different colour socks for no particular reason.I never sort my socks because I have a system. I play the odds.When I want a matching pair of socks, I grab three of them and can be sure that at least two of them match.
Dog hairs Dog hairs Dog hairs.....everywhere hairs, but how to get rid of it
Not a lot of information to work with here (dog breed, inside/outside, etc) but due to the fact that spring/summer is here I assume your dog is shedding. Shedding typically is a bodily response when warmer weather comes into play. Inside and short-haired dogs shed during this period as well.The key is not to postpone the shedding -- accelerate it and get it over with. Make the pup stay outside for long periods of time in the heat. This will promote a higher/faster shed rate as the dog's system is trying to cope with the changing season.Most important of course is to make sure the dog has PLENTY of available fresh water and food at all times, and make sure you brush them regularly (daily) and get the fluffs out.I have a German Sheppard and she just finished shedding her coat. It was horrible and my wife hated her being in the house.
How can I affix pictures/photos to a wall cleanly without damaging the paint on the wall?
I think it might be a bit late, but you could try magnetic push pins called Magnetacks. they are really strong and use magnets to hang the photos so they won't damage your photos. i use them for much larger photos so they should work great for your size. 
How to retain air in the tires of bicycle for long?
Another option (admittedly not a life hack) is to add tyre/tire sealant to your tube.  This is a white liquid latex-based goop which goes in after you remove the valve core, and then sits inside the tube.  If you get a puncture while riding the sealant is supposed to bubble out the hole for a few seconds, then harden and seal the leak.One of the well known brands is Stans, http://www.notubes.com/Stans-Tire-Sealant-Quart-P51.aspx  and while its intended for tubeless tyres, does okay in tubes too.   Note it only stays effective for months, then you need to add more.   Also, this stuff is sometimes called "stans jizz" so just call it "sealant" if you don't want a ribbing from, your riding mates.Otherwise replace your tubes, they're only a couple bucks each, and the dead tubes/valves can be used for many other things.
How to keep my phone number private, when I have to provide a way for students to contact me?
You should try Telegram. It's a message application, with versions for PC, phones and web. With it you can create a user name, and your students can find you through this user name. Also, you can crate a group composed by your students. You can share this group with your students by a link. You can silence it when you don't want to be disturbed. 
Dog hairs Dog hairs Dog hairs.....everywhere hairs, but how to get rid of it
First, get a special brush for your dog, and brush him/her every day before you let him/her in. For the hairs already in your house use rubber gloves (cheap method) or there are special things you can buy, but these are expensive.

How to get diesel out of leather boots?
Try asking the oldest boot repair person you can find. There's a good chance you have already "wrecked" your boots as far as the colour and finish. You may have to settle for a slightly different colour than you had originally due to the small variety of after-market shoe polish coloursFrom what little leather working I've had, the colour can be removed with alcohol and new polish with the colour you wish is worked back into the leather. It's a work intensive procedure done a square inch at a time with a small soft rag gently in a circular motion both for the removal and reapplication of the polish. An agreeable repair person will show you how if you want to do it yourself. It's not hard but it needs patience because it's time consuming after the leather is stitched to the last.In addition to polish, there are leather dyes, both semi-transparent and opaque that can cover your original. Depending on the finish, you might find something that suits you.I'm sure you'll get more results than with a mechanic where it happened.
How to keep my phone number private, when I have to provide a way for students to contact me?
Best way give them a wrong phone number and an email adress. You fulfil the requirements and they cannot call you at night.
Avoid feeling sick reading in a moving vehicle
I've encountered the same thing, and have noted this seems to be more prevalent in situations where 1) I am unfamiliar with the travel route and/or 2) there are lot's of twists and turns.You have the advantage in that your commute to/from school will typically follow the same route each time.  The key, I've found, is to first become familiar with the route: where are the sharp turns, steep inclines or declines  ... and where are the frequent stop and start sections.  You'll know you are "familiar" with where these things are in your route if you can successfully sleep through the trip yet still wake up in anticipation of ... say a stop or two before ... your stop! ;-)  This happens because your body has learned to subconsciously anticipate and acknowledge where and when those changes in the travel direction will occur.Once you've mastered your route you can successfully read without becoming motion sick.  You may have to pause to look up and just watch the road during the tricky areas (sharp turn, steep incline/decline, frequent stop and go), but should be able to resume reading during the rest of the trip without the motion sick feeling.Hope this is helpful!
A soft floor cover to use with a standing desk
It sounds like what you want is an anti-fatigue mat, typically used by chefs or factory workers, who often have jobs that require being on your feet most (if not all) of a work shift.You will want a mat made with gel or foam.  These typically come in half-inch dimensions, though you may be able to find something thicker if you purchase via a more industrial supplier/source.     Option #1Not sure of your location and what is accessible, but the quickest and easiest (and possibly least expensive) would be to go to your local Walmart, Sears, Lowes or Home Depot ... or other department- or home goods-type store ... and go to the section where they have the floor mats.  You may see outdoor and kitchen floor mats in the same section; the kitchen type are your best bet, as these are designed for with those standing in one place for a long time (as in washing dishes) in mind.  Look for the thicker variety, typically made with some kind of foam or gel material.  Try them out right there in the store and pick the one that makes your feet say "ahhhh!". Option #2You could also try some of these suggestions, offered as examples of different types, material/construction, and pricing:Better Homes and Gardens ProChef Comfort Chef Mat available at walmart.comthe "original gel-filled comfort mat"available at gelpro.comanti-fatigue mats, runners, and other options available at globalindustrial.com and floormatcompany.comrubbercal.comsears.comRoyal Anti-Fatigue Comfort Mat available at amazon.comOption #3You may also want to consider foot orthotics, such as is available through places like the Good Feet Store (goodfeet.com), for proper arch support - critical for those whose daily activity require or involve being on your feet for extended periods of time.Hope this is helpful!
How can I keep my knits and sweaters from pilling?
Wash "pill-friendly" items separately!If grouping several of these items in one wash:make sure these are the only items in the wash(REVISED) for sweaters, use mesh bags designed for washing delicates (use larger size mesh bag meant, say, for a blouse instead of lingerie); one item per bag)hang to dry, or dry flat (sweaters) - do not put in the dryer (these fabrics tend to shrink in the dryer and the fluff/friction action in a dryer tends to encourage more pills to form)Hope this is helpful!
How to keep my phone number private, when I have to provide a way for students to contact me?
You can try slack.https://slack.com/It's a free app and website specifically designed for teams where group interactions have to be facilitated. It's chat-only though. I don't think voice calls are supported yet. You have to create a new team and ask your students to join you by sending invites to their email. You can collapse the team after you're done with your class or you can remove members of the team.Another upside is that you get to moderate the group discussion. 
Unfreeze super glue stuck in bottle nozzle
According to the package instructions, nail polish remover can be used to remove Krazy glue residue.In my experience, once open, the Krazy glue won't last very long for a second application. I have been getting "single application" sizes of the stuff.
Body temperature, without a thermometer?
I'm traveling, in a hotel, and febrile. I don't feel well enough to go buy a fever thermometer. I feel chilled and achy. I have had the heater on, every blanket on, for an hour. I assessed my neck temp with the back of my hand. I feel hot to myself. I left 80% of a steak dinner. I'm lethargic. My pulse is 75 at rest. Normally it's in the sixties. We were exposed to our grandson's snottiness nine days ago, and granddaughter's snottiness two days ago. I'm diagnosing myself as febrile, most likely in the 100-102 *F range. I'll test my theory by self administration of 600 mg ibuprofen. If my febrility declines, I was accurate in my assessment.I'm a Professional Ski Patroller, Certified #580, accustomed to making do with limited resourcesAPP Preamble to our Code of Ethics"We the willing, led by the unknowing, are doing the impossible for the ungrateful.

How should I store super glue to prevent it from drying out?
I've had good luck by putting petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on a pin or nail and sticking that in the bottle before putting the cap on or creating a ring of the same on the edge of the container. Petroleum jelly is oil based and oil and water don't mix. The jelly creates a seal that keeps moisture-laden air from seeping in and hardening the glue in the spout. Buying super glue in tiny tubes can help too. The tiny tubes don't seem to allow as much air in and you can just use what you need. 
How to get diesel out of leather boots?
Corn starch will help to absorb the diesel.  Also diesel will evaporate.  I would give it a couple weeks and see how much it fades before doing anything drastic.
How do I securely tie my shoes?
Rub a candle along your shoelaces. The wax will prevent them from untying.I have been using this technique for a long time with my football boots, which before opened up all few minutes. Now the laces stick together until I choose to open them up again.The cool thing about this lifehack is, that it will work with almost any shoelaces, no matter if they're round or flat, if they're made out of leather or cloth.
How do I repel bugs from face
You're baiting them.Stop wearing perfume or cologne that will attract insects to you. The little creatures are drawn to your scent. The innocent lotions, oils, salves, unguents, and detergents you use on yourself and your clothing are luring the little guys to what to them looks like a big beautiful flower.The most natural bug repellent is NO attractive odour.
How can I deal with refrigerator odor when it is turned off for a long period of time?
You should clean out the interior of your refrigerator with a mild solution of bleach and soap. You should only need to do this before you leave for a long time.When you are using the fridge, unless you are moving around like a lab technician, little bits of food and fluids (like milk, e.g.) will drip and fall into the fridge.When the fridge is running, these small amounts of material do not serve as "food" for airborne funguses and bacteria, because the cold environment and positive airflow keep those things from entering the interior of the fridge.But when you turn it off, it's just a box, with tiny bits of food and dried fluid in it.  Over time, the bacterial/fungus life around your fridge will creep in, and use that material to grow and live.  In the case of the fungus (which is essentially like plants), it will settle in, and grow, sort of like moss.In the case of the bacteria (which are kind of like animals), they will eat the stuff, and then run out of food, and die -- leaving a stink.When you leave on long deployment:Turn off the fridgeRemove all the food/contentsWipe the interior down with a bleach/water/soapy spongeWipe it down AGAIN with water so you don't leave a soap residueLeave the door open if you canMaybe consider leaving an open box of Arm & Hammer baking soda in there to fight odors, especially if you must leave it closedIt's a little hassle on the way out to avoid a LOT of hassle on your return.

How to clean 'Iron removal filter'?
If the filter is trapping iron oxide (rust) particles, then the following describes a chemical means of clearing the filter. Oxalic acid's main applications include cleaning or bleaching, especially for the removal of rust (iron complexing agent). Bar Keepers Friend is an example of a household cleaner containing oxalic acid. Its utility in rust removal agents is due to its forming a stable, water-soluble salt with ferric iron, ferrioxalate ion.
How can I remove tobacco spots from the inner edges of book pages?
Answer:This is not possibleAs Bamboo stated (see comments), if its tar, the only way to remove that is to wash the object thoroughly, though on some things, it remains. It's not possible to thoroughly wash a book clearly, so there is no real way to remove the marks.
How can I kill spiders while suffering from arachnophobia?
Killing methodA long pole (quaterstaff or something). The distance is good and wait while they are sitting still, aim and then one good jab. Do a quick finish if it isn't killed in one go.Non lethal methodMaybe like makesift a box with a lid and rope on a long stick and just capture it and release it somewhere else. Like this: Check out spider catcher: Spider catcher maybe you can buy somewhere else for cheaper.Fun little fact: Some spiders keep frogs as pets.
How do I repel bugs from face
Look for clothing impregnated with "Permetherin" which is a derivative of the chrysanthemum developed for the US military to repel insects.The label lists effectiveness with many different types of crawling and flying critters you'd find in your garden. It is an insecticide (insects) and aracnicide (spiders). It is available as a cream to apply to the skin; but, there are possible reactions as with stuff like this. Read the contraindications and side effect warnings.The clothing is good for about 70 washes according to the label if it is not dry-cleaned. Wash in mild soap only.For exposed skin, the clothing label suggests using insect repellant suitable for direct application to the skin! (Go figure.)
How can I remove tobacco spots from the inner edges of book pages?
Well, if the pages are pretty white, you can just use white out to get the stains out. Obviously this won't make it look 100% gone, due to discoloration, but it would be better than nothing.
How can I kill spiders while suffering from arachnophobia?
Two responses: 1 - I would look into a gecko or other type of lizard that eats spiders, and allow it free range. It will be a companion of sorts (though generally will seek to live behind your stove or under your furniture); in the event that you see a spider and have some mechanism for capturing/disabling it - the lizard will also serve as a simple disposal mechanism - no need for cleanup. 2 - Seek professional help with your phobia. You are not weak, or sad, or defective for having this phobia - but there's GREAT news: phobias are, BY FAR, the psychological issue with the highest treatment success rate. You CAN receive reasonable and unscary treatment for this phobia and get on with your life. Enough with the little buggers. You can be free!If/when you do that - you'll be able to use normal tools to deal with them. Your gecko friend will also be very proud of you, if a little hungrier. 
How can I kill spiders while suffering from arachnophobia?
I used to suck them up with the vacuum cleaner. It works fine, I promise you they die in there, but eventually my conscience got the better of me and I trap them instead, with a big tall glass and a bit of card.
Natural remedies to get rid of flies (Housefly)
I dont know if most people knew about this remedy to avoid housefly. Using plastic water bags to keep away flies. My friend has a grocery store and have seen him to hang half filled plastic water bags on the entrance of the store. Didnt know the reason behind this until now but after searching about it i got this. There are at least two reasons explained for this remedy which seems to be beyond logic. One is that the flies are not able to see the water bag as a water bag. Due to their structure of eyes, clear water filled bags are seen as something resembling a spider’s web by the flies. As such, they don’t come near such thing. The other reason states that the reflection of water is enough to disorient the flies and to create some unexplainable illusion to them. Get this:Clear plastic bag (gallon size)-1WaterDo this:Fill the plastic bag with water. Keep it halfway full with water.Tie a knot at the mouth of the bag to secure it properly. You may also use a thread or a rubber band for the purpose.Now just hang this water filled plastic bags near your entryways, garage doors or any other such outdoor entrance.Advantages:dosn't harm any housefly only keeps them away. no use of any harmful chemical.cheapSource: Google

How do I repel bugs from face
I've seen hats that were modified by hanging a row of wine bottle corks from string attached to the brim of the hat.  The corks hang down a few inches and are always jiggling around in front of your face, shooing away the bugs.  If you do this, make sure the strings are all about the same length and spaced apart to avoid the corks wrapping around each other.  Here's a pic.Source bugoff.com
Remove oil build-up on the touchpad
I use  windex or any other brand degreaser (not corrosive).If it proves  too hard to remove, just keep in mind that sometimes due to heavy use the "shine " on the pad is not grease or dirt, but a pad that got its surface worn out over use the same way mouse buttons or keyboard keys get worn out and shiny.

Cold environment or iced drinks may also be the cause of your continuous sneezing.
How can I get rid of the tiny fish-bone stuck in my throat upon eating fish?
There are some at-home remedies you can try in order to alleviate the throat irritation and pain brought about by a fish bone that gets stuck. You should try these remedies as soon as the bone gets stuck, and if none of these treatments work, go see a doctor.1. CoughThe very first thing you can try is coughing. In some cases, heavy coughing can help dislodge the stuck bone.2. Drink Salty WaterIf coughing does not work, you should take a glass of lukewarm water, add a pinch of salt to it, and then drink the mixture. If the fish bone is small enough, it will be dislodged by the salt water and be taken down the alimentary canal to your stomach.3. Ingest MarshmallowsYou can also try the ingestion of marshmallows as a remedy. Fill your mouth with just enough marshmallows to make chewing possible. Only chew on these marshmallows a little bit and then swallow. The lump of marshmallows will be sticky, and once swallowed, it might be enough to take the bone down to the stomach. Make sure you drink water after this. Similarly, you can rely on a piece of bread and peanut butter to provide stickiness that is similar to that provided by marshmallows. Alternatively, if there is sticky rice available to you, take a spoonful of it and swallow it without chewing. Be careful not to ingest too much of it, or you might risk choking.4. Drink Olive OilAnother thing you can try is to soften the fish bone stuck in throat. In a glass of water, boil a handful of olives. Drink the liquid while it is warm, so that the bone can be softened and possibly taken down the esophagus. You can also try drinking warm olive oil to provide lubrication.5. Try BananaTake some banana and keep it in your mouth for a few minutes until it moistens. Make sure you do not chew it! Once it is moist enough, slowly swallow it. The stickiness of the banana may attract the fish bone and if it does, the bone will easily be taken down to the stomach.6. Drink VinegarSome people suggest drinking diluted vinegar to soften and even dissolve the bone. The success of this method has yet to be reported widely, but this is still worth trying.7. Medical TreatmentMedical treatment to remove fish bone stuck in throat works through a series of steps.Firstly, to determine the exact location of the fish bone stuck in your throat, the medical care provider may carry out an X-ray that involves ingesting a barium-based liquid. Other methods include a laryngoscopy to have a look at the back of your throat, a CT scan in extreme cases, and an endoscopy to determine the level of damage that the fish bone has caused to your digestive tract.  When the location is determined, using forceps will usually be the first method to remove the fish bone. Endoscopy may also be used to remove the bone in cases where forceps fail to retrieve the bone. In very rare cases, surgery may be required.  Once the object has been taken out, some medications may be prescribed, depending on the severity of the lodging of the fish bone in your throat.When to See a DoctorIf the home remedies fail and your condition is accompanied by the following symptoms, you should seek immediate help from a doctor:Pain when swallowing or even a sore throat vomiting blood    Difficulty breathing or breathing that is accompanied by coughs, choking or gagging    Pain in chest and abdomen    FeverEven when the home remedies do help you remove the fish bone stuck in throat, you'd better pay close attention to the above symptoms and see your doctor if you have similar discomfort.
Remove oil build-up on the touchpad
I use cleaning spray for glasses on a paper towel and it works fine. But as stated by Arana, it can just be that you plastic is worn. It then becomes smooth and shiny.
Keeping small containers cool on long trip
Use the cooling blocks that are sold in camping and outdoor stores. They don't leak and keep cool for quite a long period of time. If you combine one of those with a small isolating bag, you should be ok.
Remove oil build-up on the touchpad
I've always used rubbing alcohol, but that's out of laziness. Any alcohol based solvent will begin to wear away at the plastic if you use it too frequently. I clean my laptop every few months with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol, and haven't noticed any wear or functionality issues, but just be cautious of it. To clean the oil effectively, you'll need something non-polar, like alcohol. To clean any salt residue, use water, or something water-based (but only a small amount).
Keeping small containers cool on long trip
An insulating bag as mentioned by Takkat is a start, but icepacks would have to last the outward and return journey. If there is a supermarket nearby, you could buy some frozen peas or other veg and put that in bag with your vitamins and that would keep it cool at least for a few hours. Even if they thaw out completely frozen vegetables are perfectly safe to eat and refreeze.
What to do with delivery boxes when recycle bin is full?
As stated by James, you neighbors can be your best friends in this situations. Another idea is a lokal elementary school: they often look for cardboard boxes for making little projects with the kids. Here in the Netherlands, sportsclub will collect them to sell them to recycling plants for money.
How can you get your car as cool as possible on a hot summer day without air conditioning?
Best way is to get the powerful 12V electronic Car use Cooling fan. I have the Abovetek two heads car air fan from https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CESJTC, it works so well to quickly blow away the hot air from summer parking car. Two heads are 360 degree rotatable so it helps to cool you down and at the same time cool your pet down, isn't cool. The cord is long enough so you can put the fan at the arm rest area to cover both front seat and back seat, FYI.
Alternative to expensive disposable floor mats for taking care of recurring puddle next to toilet?
Most stores that sell restroom accessories (local to me, J.C. Penney, Target or Kmart, as examples) have small horseshoe shaped rugs, made to fit around the base of a toilet stool.  These will soak up the misses as well as the disposable pads, and are washable.Couple that with applying a sealant to the flooring around the commode, to keep the urine that gets through the rug from soaking into the grout, and you should be covered without spending a mint on disposable absorbents.
How to open push/pull doors in a wheelchair
Be sure she carries a mobile phone.  Then, if she can't get into a shop, she can call and ask the staff to assist with door opening.Longer term, she may wish to let these shops know that she can't patronize them because they aren't accessible -- a word which has come to have a connotation of things like wheelchair ramps, automatic or manual powered doors, aisle wide enough for power scooters and chairs, etc.The simplest, a plate-operated powered door, is a fairly inexpensive modification, as these things go, and many shops will be willing to install one in order to increase their accessibility for wheelchair or crutch users.  In some locations, this is required by law, but be careful pushing for legal solutions; the cost can drive a small business to close its doors.One method I've seen used in parking garages is to go in and out where the cars do.  There's usually a pedestrian walkway that bypasses the gate bar, and in my experience it usually has wheelchair cuts as well.  If she's had to park above ground level, almost all higher parking structures have elevators (required by law almost everywhere in the USA); she could take the elevator to ground level first.
Keep that fungus smell out of your home this monsoon
First of all, if humidity is a recurrent problem, you might want to consider investing in a dehumidifier, some might seem costly but they are really worth it, I bought one for 75 dollars for my parents' house, the ambience has improved so much and my mom's health as well(as you mention, the constant humidity made my mom sick, she had fungus stored in her lungs and it took at least 5 months for her to be back at 100% health) So I can tell you how beneficial would a dehumidifier will be for you, the first couple of weeks you might have to use it on a daily basis, since humidity percentage is going to be at a high percentage. But afterwards, you'll only have to use it 1 to 3 times per week to keep it at the level you want.Now for the current fungi and mold in your house, make a weak to mild mix of water with bleach, and scrub away. It's a tedious task, but beneficial in the long run. 
Keeping tub and shower clean, mildew-free
Yes, there is.You might want to get transparent plastic walls instead of a curtain (a solid "curtain" makes the process easier)If you use shower gel or bathing lotion/salt, rinse the shower or tub clear when you´re done.If you don´t have a window in your bathroom, give the humidity a few minutes to subside. If you have one, open it before step 4 and leave it open for five to ten minutes after step 5.Use a window cleaner on the walls to reduce the amount of towels needed in step 5Use a towel or two to dry the shower/tub/sink, the curtain, the walls and the silicone and rub the faucet clean.You may need chemicals and scrub a while, maybe even replace the silicone, to get it in order in the beginning; but actually towels are all you need to keep it clean.
How to make a cellphone tripod?
The bottle tripod won´t work for a cell phone, but it inspired me. Haven´t tried it, so no guarantee there, but it might work:Take two pairs of pliers (with rubber applied to the handles, if you have) or two clothspins.Clamp each of them into a bottle and put the bottles side by side.Use a table, chair, stool, footstool, cardboard box or a combination to get to the desired level.Set the timer on your camera app, put the phone between the handles and off you go.You may have to practice a bit until you get the angle right. A sock or a handkerchief might help.
How to keep bread fresher for longer
I keep my bread in the plastic it came in, and lay it in a 2 1/4 inch deep aluminum baking pan (the regular kind found at any local grocery store). Our microwave is on the kitchen counter, underneath a wall cabinet. There's about 13 inches of space between the top of the microwave, and bottom of the cabinet, and the microwave is wide enough to store the pan & our toaster. The area stays relatively dark, and cool. Since I began keeping our bread there, I've noticed that none of it ever molds, or goes stale. My boyfriend and I, went on vacation for 2 weeks, and came back to bread that was purchased about 2 weeks prior to leaving (1 month old) that had no mold! ^_^ Now, because of this, I keep close track of the dates the bread is purchased so that we're not eating old bread lol.
How can I prevent slugs on my glass sliding doors
WD-40 can be used in the bottom part of your glass door so they won't be able to climb, sliding down, and it will be invisible. WD-40 is waterproof, so it will be effective as a barrier even after a season of rain. Vaseline can also be used for the same purpose, but it's messy and needs replacing often.Another tip: keep them from crossing anywhere using a copper tape, the snails feel a kind of shock touching it, so it will keep them away. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osZXETdJ4mw
Keeping tub and shower clean, mildew-free
Keep it simple. Leave a spray with a mixture of Bleach and water near the tub, spray in everything after you are finished in shower. Works for me.
How do I repel bugs from face
Natural repellent , flexible recipe, works really well:100 gram of whole cloves100 ml of mineral oil, baby oil, sesame, almond, etc.1/5L of vodka (or any other alcohol/spirit with no strong nor sweet smell)Put cloves in alcohol, stir 3 times a day, during 4 days. Then add the oil, mix well, and it's ready to use.Spread a few drops in your face, arms and legs.
Keeping tub and shower clean, mildew-free
The best cleaner I've found for bathroom scum is a mixture of vinegar and Dawn.  Dawn cuts oils really well and the vinegar kills the bacteria.  I read this somewhere before re-caulking around the tub and was surprised at how really well it worked.  If you're killing the bacteria regularly and getting rid of the oils, it should keep it cleaner.  I put it in a squirt bottle, let it sit for about 5 minutes, ran over it quickly with an old toothbrush and everything rinsed and wiped right away.
How can I prevent slugs on my glass sliding doors
There is a product for slug and snail killing, I used to live in a house where it was heavily shaded by massive oak trees, and had a real slug and snail problem, I bought a box of it at the home improvement store.  If I remember it looked kind of like very small wood shavings.  They LOVED it, but found their bodies everywhere the next day.  It really, really works!  I'm sure there are several brands out there, but it wiped out a large population in just a few nights.
How can I kill spiders while suffering from arachnophobia?
While I'm not sure how big the spiders are in question, (I would imagine that in Australia, they can get pretty big), my sisters both use something called the bugzooka. This is essentially a spring loaded vacuum-creating device that sucks the bug or spider into a semi-sealed chamber which will eventually starve it to death or you can also choose to humanely release it somewhere outside. 
Keep razor usable longer
A plastic toothpick keeps your razor efficient over time. It may damage the blades, but it makes the razor feel like new.I shave every two days, which tends to make the hair accumulate no matter how much water, shaking,  scrubbing against old fabric, and tapping I did.Whenever the razor efficiency feels like meh, use the pointy head and scrap between the blades, then bash the razor under running water.
Keep razor usable longer
In addition to everything else, soften your beard. I found that shaving in the shower after my beard was well-soaked and clean was less resistance for the blade. I could get more shaves in the shower than over the sink with hot lather and brush. I think the shave was better, too.I think that the less resistance allows the blade to hold its edge longer. My tip amounts to reducing the abrasion that dulls the minimally thin edge.I have no statistics but that's my experience. Your mileage may vary.
How can I improve dish washer performance?
You could try adding a 2-4 quarts of vinegar to an empty load and letting it run for an extended period. Over time you can get buildup on the lines/sprayers and the vinegar will help clear out the buildup. Clearing out this buildup will provide better power for the sprayers and in turn, cleaner dishes. Of course I would run an extra cycle or two with fresh water afterwards.
Keep razor usable longer
Shave with an electric razor prior to using the blade.I have thick beard growth and need to shave more than once per day to stay  clean shaven.  For me, an electric razor isn't enough to do the job on its own, but if I use it prior to using a disposable, it limits the amount of "work" the disposable has to do. It hurts less, and as a side effect, the disposable razor will last a month or so.
How do I fill this tire? The valve stem is inaccessible.
It looks like those 3 bolts are your salvation. Removing the outer panel of the rim should give you plenty of space to get something on the stem.

How do I fill this tire? The valve stem is inaccessible.
If in fact this is a split rim, you're correct that splitting it will release the bead; if there's even a few pounds of pressure left in the tire, it could also be dangerous (picture getting that rim in the face if one bolt fails after you have the other two nuts off).Split rims are still seen occasionally on truck tires (older ones), made to ease installing the bead on the rim.  What you have there, however, looks like a two-sided steel spoke rim.  The three lugs hold the wheel to the axle spider or brake drum, and removing those bolts should just drop the wheel off the kart.The solution to your stem accessibility problem is most likely to take the wheel off the kart, take it anywhere that installed tires, and ask them to replace the stem with a bent extended stem, which will protrude from the wheel and give you easier access.  You'll probably have to pay a mount/dismount charge, as well as purchase the new stem(s), but then you'll have easy access to keep your tires correctly filled.
How can I improve dish washer performance?
Hotter water is the biggest factor in the effectiveness of a dishwasher.  In the USA, at least, this is dependent on the home hot water supply.  If you have access, you can turn up the thermostat on your water heater to a minimum of 130 Fahrenheit and likely see a significant improvement.  Many rentals have the thermostats set lower, typically 120 F, for liability reasons, but most dishwashers (especially the lower-end units commonly found in rental houses and apartments, which lack reheaters) don't clean well at that temperature.The thermostat on the water heater probably won't be calibrated, so you'll have to turn it a little, wait 1-2 hours, and then run the water in a nearby tap until it's as hot as it can get before checking with a cooking thermometer.  You may have to go through a few cycles of this to get the temperature right.  Also, you gain little to nothing going above 135 F, and greatly increase the risk of a scalding accident if someone draws cold water while a hot shower is running or similar flow conflict occurs.

How to remove ball pen marks from the clothes?
Getting pen marks, dots and lines on the back of your shirt is very common as a student. Because we always sit one behind the other and slipping of the pen is common. I have myself got many such designs on my new and expensive shirts. I once wore a costly casual plain white shirt to college. The person behind me had a Reynolds waterproof gel pen. He was very careless in handling it. So there were all zig zag lines on my white shirt at the end of the day. There was no way I could remove the lines. As I am experienced in this, let me tell you.1. Roller ink pen stains on your shirt are easy to remove as they are water based2. Ball point pen marks will gradually disappear if you wash with alcohol3. However if someone has used a waterproof gel pen or a marker on your shirt, you will never be able to get rid of it. Either throw it away or continue wearing it.So please don't wear any expensive light coloured shirts to places where there is a danger of pen marks.
How to control phone while inside VR device without an action button
Without an integrated controller, your best bet is an external one, such as a bluetooth controller. These are readily available online for relatively cheap: For example.I know that the Samsung VR headset comes with an integrated controller that allows you to swipe by the side of the device to control, but as you don't have one of those, it isn't as relevant.
Prevent wearables from smelling like body odor
I'll add this: don't get leather on your skin. Because it's permeable and can absorb sweat, it can hold onto body odors for a long time and is hard to clean.Also, periodically dip the wearables in alcohol to kill off the germs which cause body odor.(Note that I'm not responsible if the alcohol damages the rubber seals or anything else) 
How to protect food from fungi
The air and all surfaces around us are full of moulds, bacteria and yeasts. Thinking that you can totally avoid them on your food is not realistic. Often the products are already a tiny bit contaminated from the manufacturing and packing proces (however clean the factory tries to work). This is nothing to worry about as it will be very very rarely cause any problems. Other products like milk  will be sterilized of pasteurized to remove those contaminations.As someone who makes all kinds of fermented foods on a regular base, I often contaminate food on purpose to start a fermentation proces. Yeast is added on purpose to you bread, beer and wine. Moulds are added to cheese and some meatproducts.Often unwanted moulds on food products in our fridges are not very harmfull. But if you don't know for sure then throw it away.cheese:White moulds on hard cheeses are most of the time eadible. If you don't want them, you can whipe them of with clean paper towel, wash them of with some brine or just remove the mouldy piece on your cheese and eat the rest.bread:Most moulds on bread are pretty harmless to but the problem with bread is that it isn't easy to remove the moulds so trowing it away is the best solution.Best way to store your bread is in a paper bag or a in a bread basket. You should noy leave them in the plastic bags that they come in. Often the bread is put in that bag when it's still hot. The steam coming of that bread will make the inside of the bag very moist and that will help moulds to grow.fruit and veg:Fruit and veg often rot very locally. Most of the time, the part of the fruit/veg that in't rotting is eadible. So by cutting away the bad parts, you can still use it. You should store fruit and veg in a dry place. A cool place will do nicely but don't put them in the fridge. Don't wash them before you put them away as it will speed up the rotting proces.meat:Meat is something totally different. I make a lot of cure meats and I do at my my own risk. My advise is: if you don't trust it throw it away. Bacteria in meat can be pretty harmful ranging from some extra visits to the toilet to death.If you handle meat (especially when you want to store it afterwards), always make sure that you kitchen is super clean and wash your hands every time before you touch te meat. Always store it in the fridge.Take special care with prepared foods. They are one of the mayor sources of food poisoning. Most of them will perish rare fast ranging from 2 days to a week (depending on how much preservatives are in it) keep the in the fridge at all times. A good tip to avoid contaminations in you fridge is to put the dy goods on the top shelves and the wet and liquid goods on the lower ones. This way you can avoid contamination when something spills or drips.
How to protect food from fungi
The simplest way to prevent mold on anything that can tolerate it is to freeze the item until you're ready to prepare it.  This may not kill mold spores, but they won't grow at freezer temperature -- so the food won't have any more mold on it when you take it out of the freezer than it did when it went in.Some foods (like cheeses) don't freeze well, and others (meats and fish) have a limited freezer life, so watch what you're doing -- but as a bonus, freezing also kills insect eggs that are inevitably present in flour and meal, so your flour doesn't get weevils if it sits too long.
Prevent wearables from smelling like body odor
I clean my apple watch band with disinfectant hand soap. It doesn't damage the strap and cleans well. I clean the watch itself with screen cleaner, since mine has alcohol in it as well.I do this every 2-3 days and it keeps it free from BO and discolouration.
how to eat loud food (chips, celery) quietly
For chips, crisps, tortillas and etc, press them against the roof of your mouth using your tongue. The softness of the tongue will help to suppress the crunch noise. Then eat normally. Those foods shapes are specially engineered to do the crunch sound, so that's a quiet way to get rid of the shape first, then eating.For celery, first slice in pieces. Place a piece in between your last teeth, empty the air from your mouth, then bite slowly. Same theory as above, get rid of the crunchy shape. Just be careful to not bite your cheek. After the first bite, finish it normally.

How to fill in my beard?
If you're using a cream based on minoxidil, you're doing the opposite of what you need.  Minoxidil works, in part, by blocking the reaction of hair follicles to testosterone.  For hair on the head, in men, this reaction may be to stop growing hair, but in your beard, testosterone promotes hair growth -- so minoxidil prevents the beard from filling in.Sadly, it's unlikely that testosterone cream applied to the face would have the effect you want; my experience is that you're pretty well stuck with the beard pattern your genes gave you by the time you're about 25 years old.  If you're younger than that, it's likely your beard will fill in somewhat -- but if older, all you can really do is find a trim style you're happy with that works with the hair growth pattern you have.
Without Trial and Error or a dental professional, how can you determine your size of Interdental Brush?
While this is not a direct answer to your question, it is an indirect one. Getting the answer from a professional need not be costly.Many dental professionals will probably see you for a consultation. Sometimes walk-in clinics will see you and sometimes you can make an appointment.While I haven't tried it, I'm reasonably sure that such a question will be answered without charge by a dentist or a dental hygienist. I've had free consultations and second opinions.Many hospitals have dental aid available. Stopping in to get such preventative information is part of wellness regime that no health care unit could refuse. They probably have samples to give away.Every dental care unit I have ever visited has bags and boxes of samples donated by manufacturers to give away. They are not for resale. A dentist or dental hygienist will probably give you a small bag of different brushes, floss, and scrapers to find one that suits your regime and mouth.Contact product manufacturers directly and ask for samples. They will probably fall all over themselves to please such an aware and cautious person. Their names and addresses are on the packaging in a well-stocked pharmacy or on the Internet.
How can I avoid a side stitch while running?
Give it two weeks and the "stitch" should go away with the same amount of exercise. Here's why.The side stitch you are experiencing is actually adaptive. It is the key to fitness. That side stitch is the result of inadequate oxygen to your kidneys (hypoxemia.) That hypoxemia triggers a variety of adaptive responses. 2,3-DPG will be released. This will change your red blood cell's affinity for oxygen making it easier for oxygen to be released. It will also result in the concentration of your blood (hemoconcentration) by causing you to shed fluid so your blood is thicker and carries more oxygen per unit of volume. (Your hemoglobin/hematocrit will increase.) Lastly, your kidneys will release erythropoietin (i.e. the hormone Lance Armstrong and others chemically doped with) that will cause your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The main effects from hypoxemia will kick in about 7-10 days after you experience that side stitch and peak about 2 weeks after. That will be your moment of maximal fitness. If you do not continue to stress your body at that point - your 2,3-DPG levels will drop and your body will slide back to its normal state. This adaptive cycle is likely why all those recent studies you may have been seeing on high-intensity training (HIT) have shown it to be just as effective as long cardio sessions (i.e. training just 1 minute three times a week is just as effective as training one hour three times a week on FiO2 uptake and other measures of fitness.) In sum, the "stitch" in your side is actually the key to achieving higher states of fitness. About two weeks after feeling a "stitch" will be your peak moment of adaptation from that hypoxemia causing that "stitch." If you can drive yourself to feel a "stitch" every time - you are taxing your cardiovascular system enough to trigger adaptations to higher levels of fitness."Fitness" is a high energy state. Though it increases adaptability to stresses and decreases short term mortality - there is a clear underlying metabolic cost that the body truly wants to avoid. Your body will continually try to slip back to that lower energy state and make it so the "stitch" returns. Someday we may discover why the body seems to work so hard to be an "unfit" state.
How to clean 'Iron removal filter'?
The filter you show for the unit you have cannot be cleaned for reuse.It is replaceable and should not be reused due to the chemical action of the filters construction. It cannot be reversed mechanically for reuse. The filter is not simply a mesh kind of screen that can be flushed clean. Attempting to do as you wish will compromise the filter effectiveness possibly making your whole filtration unit unusable. The spent filter is a consumable and must be discarded according to the manufacturer's recommendations and replaced with a fresh filter.Using chemicals that are not approved for the filter can have unexpected consequences. The filter can be destroyed. The unit that holds the filter can become unusable. Lastly, you could hurt yourself by ingesting toxic chemical residue.
Is it possible to make stiff cables and wires flexible again?
Re: Make stiff cables flexible again. One technique used for replacing stiff lawnmower tires is to soak them in hot water until they become pliable. This also works to a degree on detached foreign made power cords. Cords attached to electronics can be heated with a hair blower but this takes a lot of time and electricity. Another possibility I have not yet done is to lay the cord on a hot asphalt driveway during summer. But, this runs the risk of UV light destroying the plastic jacket. No one method seems to work 100% due to the chemicals used in plastic manufacturing. I think the objective is to get products out the door as fast as possible with little regard to usability.

When it comes to bread, we always buy the day-old (or more) returns from the supermarket sold at discount for a fraction of the cost. In most cases, it's no different than buying bread at full price and then using it later in the week. We always keep the bread in it's original plastic sleeve and store it in the refrigerator for as long as a month without problems.  
Is it possible to make stiff cables and wires flexible again?
The erasers on wooden pencils get hard and don't work. A tip I heard about that works with that kind of "rubber" is to moisten it with a drop or two of keroscene (lamp oil) on a cotton ball or rag. It smells bad but it works well to rejuvenate them.Maybe it will work on your equipment to soften them up somewhat.
Without Trial and Error or a dental professional, how can you determine your size of Interdental Brush?
I use the same brand, so I can give you a rough rule of thumb, assuming you've used dental floss in the past. If floss tends to break or shred, or you find that some floss is too thick to use comfortably, try the blue or pink size. I suggest you get a pack of both, because some the spaces between your teeth will be wider, some narrower. Otherwise, I'd try the orange or red.Alternatively, I have seen packs with a brush in each size (these packs aren't listed on the page you linked to, but I have seen them in stores). Your teeth are unlikely to be all exactly the same distance apart, so you'll probably be able to use at least three of the brush sizes in the pack. And the remaining brushes may come in useful for cleaning other things besides teeth. So this is a fairly cost-effective way to find out your size.
Alternative to expensive disposable floor mats for taking care of recurring puddle next to toilet?

How to clean computer peripherals?
Air dusters (example) can remove loose dust, and are useful when you can't reach or don't want to open things up a lot. Wipes or towels (damp, not wet!), with a thin soap solution if necessary, take care of light grime. Anti-bacterial soap removes bacteria from user interaction devices.If you're OK with taking your hardware apart you can leave plastic parts in a warm soap bath for a while to easily tease out tough stains.

How to clean computer peripherals?
Unless you're talking about down the cracks, under the keys, etc you could only reach by disassembly, then about the best thing to clean anything with is a pair of microfibre cloths.I wrote a train-spotter's guide to cleaning screens on Ask Different - the same applies to any hard surface.repro from Ask Different: Cleaning my Macbook Pro Retina leaves greasy 'streaks' across the screen ...Two microfibre cloths, available from any supermarket.   Don't get the  'smooth' ones specially for glass, they can be a bit hard on a plastic  screen, get the 'fluffy' ones that make your fingers itch, like  picking up tiny velcro.One cloth completely wetted in lukewarm water [nothing else], then  squeezed as dry as you possibly can [trick - fold in 4, then roll &  wring. You really want it as dry as possible].   The other cloth  totally dry.   If the screen is warm, you may need the first cloth  very slightly wetter - but never anywhere near wet enough to dribble  if squeezed - you really don't want any water that could run down the  screen. The cloths work better when almost dry anyway.    If the  screen is cold & also dark, i.e. computer off, you'll also find it  much easier to see when it's clean.Wipe the damp one gently over the screen, multiple times, turning the  cloth, pay attention to the edges & corners. The trick is gentle  repetition, rather than 'force'.  Then, whilst the screen is still  very slightly damp, wipe over again with the dry one, completely  drying the surface.Smears gone forever… well, until next time ;-)Please don't be tempted to use any type of domestic cleaner or alcohol. You never know what type of screen coating any given screen  has & some cleaners can irreparably damage the coating layer of some  screens.Alternatively...If you mean down below where you could possibly reach with a cloth or even air-blower, then you can in fact put keyboards in a dish-washer or washing-up bowl, so long as you keep the water cool, use no soap except the simplest of [hand] dishwashing detergent [supermarket cheapest own brand contains little in the way of contaminants, hand softeners etc] and allow a lot of time for natural drying, not using the heated dryer cycle.I know, it's one of those things that you keep seeing in advice columns, yet never dare test for yourself.Test on some old keyboard you don't care about & report back afterwards.[Caveat: this works better on expensive keyboards than cheap ones. Cheap ones sometimes rely on a lubricant to fool you into thinking they work smoothly. After cleaning they will become 'clickier' than when new.]
How do you remove dust between keyboard keys?
I sometimes run a vacuum hose over my keyboard (with the computer off) and simultaneously work the keys to give the dirt a path out.  For an even easier way, turn it upside down and shake/press keys while gravity does the work for you.  It gets most of the big stuff.
Natural remedies to get rid of flies (Housefly)
I saw a good one where you take a water bottle and cut it in half.  Then take the top half, invert it, and place it into the bottom half.  Place a small amount of beer/juice/etc. in the bottom.  The flies will go in and will often not be able to escape.
How to protect a car from hail?
They sell padded car covers which are specifically marketed for "hail protection".Product Search: Padded Car CoverBut if you need something in a pinch, you can adapt your winter tarp for that purpose. If the tarp itself provides little protection, add a thick blanket or comforter underneath to add a little padding. Even a few pillows will effectively lift the tarp up off the car to avoid that "solid on solid" impact when ice starts falling from the sky. To keep the tarp from blowing away, you can thread some ropes through the corner grommets. If you pull them tight enough below the thickest part of the car, it should keep the tarp from blowing off. Alternatively, if you tie a rope to each corner of the tarp and place the loose end under each tire, you can pull the car forward an inch or two and it will effectively trap the ropes under the tires. That tarp is not going anywhere.
How to get rid of smell from kitchen trash?
The easiest way to prevent the smell is to carry it out to the trash cans outside the house.

How can I avoid dribbling spit at night?
If you could manage to sleep on your back, it could minimize the occasions when this happens.Putting a towel over the pillow case will absorb some of the moisture to further minimize the problem of a wet pillow case.As an experiment, try using mouth wash as the last step in your nightly oral hygiene regimen. The wash ensure there are no sweets in your mouth that might encourage salivating. 
Is it necessary to dry clean a merino wool scarf?
No.Dry clean only labels are attached to clothing to minimize the liability of the clothing manufacturers against damage to clothing due to being improperly cleaned and/or washed. Clothing owners would sue manufacturers for changes of size, loss of buttons, and other trivial issues. The legal "fix" was to refuse responsibility for after-purchase care with the label "notice."Wool should be washed in only cool water and air dried. Do not use heat to dry wool quickly as it will allow the wool to shrink.EDIT: I'd suggest washing something small like your scarf by hand in a bowl (bathroom sink). Use a MILD cool/cold water detergent, appropriate for washing wool, that you can find in a large market. Then, gently press the extra water from the last rinse out of the scarf. Don't twist or wring the water out.It'll take less time than the machine will.Either way, you'll end up with your scarf needing to dry out.  Air dry it flat so it won't stretch on a towel or a rack with a mesh shelf to allow the air to circulate.
How to completely be rid of bed bugs
Heat and diatomaceous earth.One key to getting rid of the little suckers is to raise the temperature of infested materials above 140°F. They will nest in tiny places such as inside the grooves of the screw-heads used to hold your bed frame together ! ! ! Books and similar porous items can be put into an oven and brought up to temperature. After you have a clean bed, Set the bed posts of your bed into pans or containers filled with an inch or two of diatomaceous earth to prevent re-contamination.Diatomaceous earth gets stuck to the skin of the bed bugs and because it is made of silica, it dehydrates the bugs through microscopic "cuts" it makes when the bed bugs attempt to get rid of the particles from their skin. Nasty stuff.  Bed bugs will travel on clothing and luggage, but not on people. Before you leave a hotel, sort your clothing into laundry piles and place in plastic bags. When you get home, empty them directly into a washing machine and wash in hot water.   After you wash your clothes, you can try to put them into black garbage bags and laying them in the sun to heat up beyond what they can survive. Turn the bags over to make sure they're hot enough through and through. A remote-reading thermometer inside the middle of one of the bags will help you get up to the desired temperature. You might have to leave them this way for a few days.  Anything that is placed where bed bugs are and that is capable of carrying them can be a source of infestation. Even a guitar and/or its case can make a handy temporary home.   Bedbugs usually prefer warm furniture where they can reach humans or animals. However, bedbugs have occasionally been found in houseplants. If you want to play it safe with something like a Christmas tree, keep the gifts in a bug-free room (not under the tree), and decorate the tree with homemade or cheap decorations that you don't mind throwing out after the holidays.   Bedbugs will bite cats and dogs, but they will only stay on the animal for a few minutes. If you see insects in the animal's fur, they are usually fleas or some other pest.   Isolate the things you can’t wash, such as furniture, and vacuum thoroughly, ideally using a vacuum with a HEPA filter. Purchase the type of diatomaceous earth sold as insecticide and sprinkle over the furniture. Lavender or tea-tree oil usually only helps a little. There's some evidence for cottonseed or linseed oil, but they can stain fabric.   You can rent steamers and HEPA vacuums from tool rental services (check the yellow pages), or buy them from hardware stores. If you need to choose a pesticide, check the EPA's online bedbug pesticide database and look for it at a home improvement store. Read all warning labels on pesticides to avoid injury to people and pets.   After you use your washer and dryer, run an empty cycle with hot water and bleach, then run a completely empty cycle. Clean your dryer using bleach wipes, then rinse it off with water. Once thy bite, try Benedryl in pill or topical form, or use a topical 1% hydrocortisone anti-itch ointment (or cream) to alleviate the itching from bites. If you apply this topical ointment and refrain from scratching, the bite will usually subside within the day.

I highly suggest using Piazza. Most of my classes in college currently use it, and it's a great way to not only allow communication between you as the instructor and the students, but also encourage collaboration between students. It's a free online web service.https://piazza.com/
How do I keep dust away when applying a laptop screen protector?
Keeping the humidity between 40-50% will prevent some static, stopping some dust from collecting. (or if this is a short job, steam up the room and leave it for 20 or so minutes to let the dust settle, then do what you need to do)Use an ionizer to make the dust stop from getting to your screen.Air purifiers and filters on the vents.and this is a good method for cleaning your screen
How can I avoid dribbling spit at night?
Elevate your head a bit more.Sleep on your back.Try practicing breathing deeply or through your nose.Brush your teeth directly before bed (?).For decreased moonlit salivation, avoid nighttime sour or sugary foods, but perhaps have a salty snack.Also, if you are drooling for more, visit here and here.Check with your doctor to make sure you do not have a condition, like Diphtheria or an allergy.Sleeping with your mouth open will not dry out your mouth. It will give you a sore throat, but clenching your teeth can give you serious health problems, though closing your mouth might help.As a last resort, duct tape your mouth closed, your arms together, and close the trunk behind you. Good luck with your moist dreams!

Magnet in shower: How to protect against rust
Paint the magnet with a good enamel paint. Ensure that the whole magnet is completely covered. You may need to apply multiple coats of paint.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to apply the paint.Depending on how the magnet is coated already, you may need to apply a coat (or more) of primer so that the enamel paint will adhere properly for a long term.
Someone locked their bike to mine - now what?
Call the police....explain the situation and maybe you could break the other lock together (without looking like a bike thief). I'm sure that locking another one's bike is illegal.Then you may want to put another lock to his bike or the police could take his bike leaving contact information at the site. The police should have the old lock so that the 'owner' will prove that he has a key for it, thus the bike is really his.I know that this will be disturbing for the other owner but he deserves it after what he's done.
Magnet in shower: How to protect against rust
Hot melt adhesive is pretty waterproof and if you have it available I would carefully paint the magnet with the hot melt.  You can re-flow the glue with a hair dryer or gas lighter to smooth the surface if you are very careful not to get stuck to the molten glue.A quick fix might be to put petroleum Jelly/Vaseline/Silicone grease into the bag with the magnet.  These will repel water and keep the magnet dry.  Heat sealing the bag with a cheap dollar store food bag sealer should help, sort of like the expensive bag sealer from Staples.Nice method would be to purchase a length of suitable diameter heat shrink tubing, preferably with the inside hot melt adhesive.  If the tubing has the adhesive you can shrink it and press the ends shut when everything is soft and sticky, use books or wood blocks so they don't melt or burn you.  If your heat shrink does not have the adhesive lining you can use your glue gun to place a generous bead of hot melt glue at each end of the magnet, when cold slip the shrink tubing over the magnet and re-heat with the hair dryer/hot air gun and proceed as above. If you leave a tail on the tubing you can use it as an attachment point.A small plastic pill container may serve the same purpose.An alternative is to use painted (or plastic coated) coathanger wire and wrap a bunch of turns around your bottle and not care if it rusts, just replace it with the new bottle and attach the magnet in a protected place so it does not remain wet.EDIT:One idea that might work is to drop some small chromed steel ball bearings into the shampoo bottle.  Then pull them to a convenient place with a external (waterproof) magnet.  You then just need to have a suitable iron spot to park your bottle.  When the shampoo runs out you can recover or throwaway your ball bearings.
How can you get algae out of of a glass bottle?
If you let some chlorine bleach stand in the bottle overnight any and all organic stuff will have been de-colourised and softened up enough to most likely rinse out.We soak out water bottles overnight in a basin with dilute bleach every 3 or 4 months or if they have been forgotten in a warm place and of pond slime. We turn them a few times when we walk past and remember so they insides are all cleaned.Getting old and hard stains out from glass bottles sand is good as mentioned in the other answer.  Borrow from aquarium or florist shop if you are too urban for sandpit or building site.
Removing dark burn mark from white shirt
If it is the fibres that are burnt you can do little to remove the burn, anything you do will wear it out if the fibres are already damaged. A careful hand wash with extra attention to the spot may dislodge any burnt jam or other dirt.Using a chlorine or peroxide bleach may save the day if it is an organic stain that looks like a burn.  Strong bleaches will weaken fabric and may strip the colour from the nearby details so test out of sight first.Using a white marker carefully (check in a hidden spot first) may just be able to make your spot the same colour as the shirt but not remove it.

Magnet in shower: How to protect against rust
Waterproofing (rust-proofing) magnets is a common application in aquarium environments where you want to attach various fixtures to a glass/acrylic fish tank with a pair of magnets. You can actually purchase coated magnets that are meant for wet environments, but I'll stick to common DIY techniques that can make a magnet waterproof at home. Waterproof Epoxy PuttyWater weld epoxy putty (for plumbing or repairing tubs, drains, fuel tanks, etc) is the easiest to work with. You can form the epoxy putty around the magnet in any shape you wish, then sand it down even further after it is dry. Bonus that epoxy putty has many other uses, and is generally useful to have around for a variety of other fix-it-yourself projects. Product Search: Water Weld Epoxy PuttyTwo-part EpoxyRegular waterproof, two-part epoxy will work too. You can slobber it on and let it cure really well. The nice thing about epoxy in general is it is sandable and won't crack/chip with continued use.Product Search: Waterproof epoxyMultipurpose Rubber DipThis is an air-dry multipurpose rubber coating which provides protection against water and can be sprayed on, painted on, or dipped directly into the product.

Magnet in shower: How to protect against rust
Try magnets modified for your specific requirement. There are two immediate possibilities.- Rubberised neodymium magnetsRubberised magnets are completely coated by a plastic layer. That makes them perfectly suitable for longterm use outdoors, in wet surroundings or even under water (e.g. in aquariums).Their finish doesn't scratch surfaces as a normal magnet.At the same time, they are much stronger than ferrite magnets of the same size.- Ferrite magnetsFerrite magnets are insensitive to humidity and can be used outdoors without rusting. A special protection is not necessary.Pot magnets with ferrite magnets are also suitable for outdoor use. Surface rust may develop on the pots over time, but that does not impact the performance of the magnets. The magnets themselves are rust-proof.Ferrite magnets are also resistant to most chemicals. However, solvents and certain concentrated acids may harm the magnets.Either of these off-the-shelf "solutions," are cheaper than most of the materials you would need to encase magnets to hack them for your application. There may be others with a similar humidity extreme requirement.
I need to get urine from one toilet to another to flush it, what should I do?
It's not the end of the world--But it's not much funFirst, urine is sterile which is a little heralded fact. It has ammonia in it so it has an objectionable odour and it comes out of the waste-end of our body but it can be handled okay.You'll need an absorbent and reusable rag, (You'll not want to keep it for very long, afterward.) A pail, and a pair of gloves (optional but recommended).As you can guess, it's a matter of soaking-up the liquid and wringing-out the stuff into something to carry it to toss.You'll have to rinse it out at least once with fresh water or with baking soda and vinegar (two heaping tablespoons into a quarter-cup of white vinegar and a cup of water).
I need to get urine from one toilet to another to flush it, what should I do?
You say the "water is turned off to do some piping work." I assume this just means the water is off to this toilet, and the toilet's drain pipe still connected to the sewer outlet. Is this so?Then the solution is really easy - you can do a "manual flush." Just take a bucket of water and pour it into the toilet. It will flush on its own if you put about 8 L (two gallons) into it. Maybe use a bucket or a large cooking pot or a garbage can.  Pour it all in at once! The urine - and anything else in the toilet - will travel to where it normally goes, without any physical contact.
how to eat loud food (chips, celery) quietly
it really works with the chips.If you are taking it out from a packet then open it wide. so that you dont mess your hand with the salt.take single piece and put it completely inside your mouth. wait.. dont just start biting it.close your mouth completely and try to make your tongue as close as possible to the lower layer of the chips slice.then crush it by pressing it upwards with your tongue. this will make the slice more moist and also the sound produced by biting it with tooth is much higher then that of tongue.so once it is crushed for the first time. then you can eat it how ever you want.enjoy munching.......

What is a good way to organise and identify keys on a keyring?

How to shred papers/letters without using a shredder machine
Receipts plague my life and if not destroyed relatively soon, they can build up into a mammoth job to discard. My current strategy is simply hand-shred them as soon as I get home/work and notice them lying around or in my pocket.Firstly, decide if it's worth keeping (for warranty etc.) then simply tear the receipt around where sensitive information is displayed.Discard the surrounding receipt like normal but with the bit containing sensitive information, I find that receipt paper is surprisingly easy to tear into thin shreds by hand!
How to wash pillow cover stained with body oils?
Use dish soap, which is meant to cut through oil/grease, to wash by hand. After you have hand washed it, run it through a normal clothes wash cycle.
How to wash pillow cover stained with body oils?
If the pillow slip is or contains cotton, it may be impossible to completely remove the skin oil, which is a fat secretion.  One of the chemical characteristics of all fats (plant or animal) is that they bind to cellulose (which is the main component of cotton) and are almost impossible to remove.  Treatment with a strong hydroxide (lye, for instance) will convert the fat to a soap which can be washed out, but will also generally destroy the cotton.Degreasers, such as dish soap, trisodium phosphate, etc. won't debond the fat from cotton, thought they will effectively remove any that's not bonded.  That likely won't help much, however.  The only real solution is to replace the item, then wash the new frequently, before the oil has a chance to bond to the cotton.
Alternative to expensive disposable floor mats for taking care of recurring puddle next to toilet?
I don't know why I didn't think of this earlier.I am a private pilot. I fly alone most of the time. I'm the only pilot aboard all of the time. When I have to pee, I cannot just get up and go to a restroom - there's none in a small plane. It's impractical to land to use a restroom which might be far away or in a big crowded airport. I can't just pull over into a rest area.When I first asked about the issue, I was introduced to a "Pilot's Comfort Station" which comes packaged for the great relief of either male or female pilots.Spruce Aircraft supplies These are for big boys and girls. They are not expensive. They can be cleaned easily. They can be re-used before emptying. They can be sealed against spills due to tipping. They don't take up much space. They can be carried into a bedroom. They are odour free when used according to instructions. There are no consumable expenses. They come in any colour. They can be ordered discreetly online. They will be delivered in plain packaging.They are also called a portable urinal.
How to prevent being startled by co-workers while listening to music at your desk?
I'm assuming you are using earbuds or earphones, so listening to music quietly without those might help you hear footsteps or lessen the alarm.Turning your desk to face the entrance might let you see the incoming.And the most complicated, make an "alarm system." Attach a little bell by the door or request for them to cough as they come or something like that. Or perhaps block the door with a plastic bag so it would rustle when they opened the door.
How to prevent being startled by co-workers while listening to music at your desk?
Keep your environmental "white noise" volume as low as possible compatible with what you need to work. Lower volume will allow your sub-conscious to keep track of the office activity while you continue to work.Place something near the office/cubicle entrance that can be used as a "door bell" to give you some prior warning that your attention is wanted. Such a thing could be a chair, wastebasket, or paper-tent "please knock" that could be easily moved and not be a hazard in the office place. A tiny wind-chime could do the trick. A bowl of candy just inside the entrance would make a sound that might not be jarring.
How to prevent being startled by co-workers while listening to music at your desk?
You could try bone conduction headphones instead of usual ones. Those conduct the sound not by air but through the bones of your skull, thus leaving your ears free to hear your surroundings.

How to hold cork board upright closer to edge of desk?
I had a similar desire and solved my needs by purchasing a flip chart at a stationery store (like Staples).I bought 3 different kinds Flip-Chart paper to see which one I preferred. I got a pad with thinly-lined 1" squares, a plain unlined white one, and a newsprint one for only pencil. (Markers can't be used on newsprint b/c it bleeds through onto the sheet(s) under it.) I now buy them with squares in cartons of 4 pads. The 25-sheet pads measure 24" X 34". They come with large holes punched along the top for attaching to an easel for presentations.You can use a desk-easel to hold your existing board as a backing.Desk Easel supportThey are somewhat adjustable and come in different sizes and capacities. Some clip onto the desk edge with a tray for stuff. Alternative to that is to go all the way and get a desk-top flip-chart holder. Desktop flip chartIf these pads are too large, they can be cut down and re-padded by most any commercial offset printing house with a paper shear. Costs for cutting and padding will be minimal.You don't even need to have them padded for convenience. Several thicknesses of chart paper can be stapled to a wood base or held by a paper clamp or "bull" clip.

How to prevent being startled by co-workers while listening to music at your desk?
I am a die-hard listen-to-music-at-work kind of person!  In fact, I find I am more distracted when I don't have music playing in background!  I have experienced working in open-floor cubicles, and office cubicles; private office (sole occupant), office with close neighbors and thin walls, as well as office-mate situations.  Here is what I have found to be the most useful and effective:Wearing headphones/earbuds for pleasure (e.g., listening to music, videos, etc.)Wear one ear on and one ear off.  You can still listen - and concentrate - to what is playing in your headphones/earbud, but hear anyone approaching or trying to get your attention.  You may have to give a little and lose some quality of sound (some sounds play in left but not right speaker, and vice versa) ... that may be the price you have to pay for being able to enjoy a little of home while at work.Wearing headphones/earbuds for professional purposes (e.g., webinar, training video, Skype interview, etc.)Hang a DO NOT DISTURB sign outside your office door/cubicle entrance indicating "Conference call/Skype Session/Webinar in progress".  Helpful to make a sign including images of all scenarios, have it laminated or put in a sheet protector, and hang it whenever you need to indicate you are not to be disturbed because of sensitive work taking place.  Co-workers will become accustomed to avoiding your office/workstation when they see "the sign" posted.It is also a good idea to fore-warn your boss, co-workers (as appropriate), and any staff that report to you with at least a day's notice that you will be unavailable for a specific period of time, for your Skype interview/webinar session.  This way, when they come looking for you and come across "the sign" it is viewed more with an "Oh, yeah ... that's right" recollection, rather than a "What the ...?!" reaction.If your office utilizes any type of shared calendar, it would be good to mark this as time you are unavailable.  So, again, if anyone goes around the office asking after you, anyone checking the shared calendar they can see you'd already marked this as time you'd planned as not available.That should cover you.  Hope this is helpful!
How to prevent HDMI cable from coming loose
This is an adaptation of my own answer on Ask Different, for a similar circumstance.One way to alleviate the pulling action is to try to get the cable pointing in a better natural direction between your two end points.You can turn any cable into an approximation of an L or even a U by the simple expedient of tying a knot in it.This is my standard way of dealing with any awkward cable.It's not perfect, but boy, it's cheap ;-)L-knotU-knotThe U-knot is achieved by simply wrapping one end through a second time, if it's not clear from the picture.BTW - keep the knot very loose, so you don't damage anything.Of course, no knot is going to help if the cable gets yanked, in any direction;  this idea is really just to set the cable off in the right direction, it will not work miracles.Just reducing its tendency to want to be straighter in the 'wrong' direction, nothing more, & reducing pull angularly, thereby reducing the lever length of the cable in that one direction.
How to prevent HDMI cable from coming loose
I find a (very) small drop of Screwlock will hold a plug in place.Screwlock is intended to stop screws coming loose in applications where they are subject to a lot of flexing, such as those that hold the arms onto the frames of spectacles.  It is not permanent, so when you want to remove the screw, it is easy.The same applies to your plug.  A drop on the plug frame helps to hold it in the socket.  But a deliberate pull on the plug will remove it.This should survive your pulling the curtains if you don't knock the cable too heavily.Screwlock (otherwise known as Loctite 222) is available from any decent hardware shop.  There are probably competing products with similar names.
Revive gel pens that stop working?
Obvious way is keep shaking it and then scribbling on a page. If that doesn't work, try put the nib under a running water tap. Once you see the ink flowing, the pen should start working after letting it dry and further scribbling on a page.Tip: When scribbling, use at least half of a scrap piece of paper and use long strides rather than short.
How to prevent HDMI cable from coming loose
Get a HDMI extension, connect one end to the back of the TV, securing it with black tape so it won't disconnect easily, and stick the other end firmly to an easily reachable part of the TV, such as it's base, the desk or even the wall. This way you are basically bringing the socket from the back of the TV (which is hard to reach) to an easier to reach point.A HDMI Angle Joint can be of big help to secure the cable on TV's back!
Revive gel pens that stop working?
Usually, it is due to ink that gets dry and stuck at the tip, so the metal ball doesn't roll properly. Heat up the nib with fire (a lighter is the best way). Only heat the end, and not too much, it is just to make the stuck dry ink to "melt" a bit and allow the metal ball to roll again. If you heat much, you will roast the ink and it will get stuck forever.
How to Dry Small, Freshly-Washed Produce (Blueberries, Raspberries, Grapes, etc.)
My preferred method is using a plastic colander (metal ones can leave an undesired taste sometimes), washing them in that, and then leaving them to air dry in the colander.

You want both heat and humidity to get the ball rolling again.So, if just breathing on it hasn't worked, try holding the nib in steam from a boiling kettle for a few seconds.  The warm water condensing on the nib can restart the flow of ink.
How to prevent HDMI cable from coming loose
The way how I have fixed the problem is to use blue tack.What I done was wrap blue tack around the HDMI cable so it was sticking out slightly, after that I then pushed the HDMI into the TV port and smoothed it around. Once it was in, I added more blue tack over until it looked like this:  The reason why I have not used your suggestions is because they either don't work (for example making a U or L knot doesn't work because how thick and heavy the cable is), or the options cost money.This bodge repair works for me because it makes the connection more secure while costing nothing (already had blue tack laying around) and it was able to make it harder to pull out.
What is a good way to organise and identify keys on a keyring?
Discard this idea if you're looking for quick identification with the requirement of some memorization (i.e. colors).  Personally, I use a metal engraver from Amazon (roughly $14) and write something on the key.  I use an acronym (SR = Snowboard Rack) or a name/word (Dad = Dad's house).  The benefit of this is that you can be descriptive, but the downside is that you will need to take a close look at your keys.
Household reference for measuring accuracy of an oral thermometer?
There isn't a high precision temperature reference in the range you want.  Wood's Metal and Field's Metal (melting points 158F and 144F respectively) melt too hot, and mercury melts much too cold (-40F).  Gallium is readily available (among other things, in the form of a gag spoon that melts in your hand), but very expensive for what should be a single use.The best option I can suggest is to buy a second digital thermometer "to keep the first one honest".  If they agree, you can be pretty confident the reading is correct.  Worth noting that there are few instances where as little as a half degree F in body temperature is significant -- for a 98.6 "normal", you'd have to be above 100 F to be considered to have a fever.Since you already know by comparison that the $10 unit is questionable, I'd recommend just returning it to the place of purchase for a refund, as "defective".
Is there any way to restore faded receipts?

How can I reduce the chlorine smell on my skin after swimming?
I always shower right after my swims and I have also noticed the chlorine smell doesn't go away.  However, I often run right after I get out of the shower.  When you start to sweat and your pores open, the smell of chlorine gets very prominent as you sweat it out (at least that's how I think of it.)  My recommendation would be to try and sweat after going in the pool.  You don't need to run though.  If your gym has a steam room, try sitting in there for a little while afterwards.  If not, go on an elliptical for a little bit.  
Is there any way to restore faded receipts?
Obviously, this is not a direct answer to the question asked... but an outside the box alternative.I don't know if this is the same world-wide, however, in the UK at least - a physical paper receipt is not a legal requirement in order to return goods.   All that is required is proof of purchase.This could be a bank or credit card statement containing the appropriate transaction. A redacted copy/scan/print is usually acceptable, in the interest of privacy.This is most apparent when returning goods bought online, as both parties usually still have access to the transaction data already, but equally applies to in-store purchases.

How would one digitize a thick book into a PDF version in the most time-efficient way, using only a camera and a computer?
You can convert your book to a PDF in about as much time as it will take you to read it through, maybe a bit longer.You will need a sheet of glass to hold the book, spread open, facing downward.Photograph the book through a sheet of glass to keep the spread pages flat. The glass becomes the subject image plane.Your camera will face toward the open book reflected in a mirror placed at 45° to the surface of the glass from beneath the glass. The mirror, although not first surface, should not have objectionable reflections when it is aligned. Using this set-up allows you the maximum amount of freedom to move things independent of one another.Alternately, you can put the glass "image plane" between supports such as an inverted stool using the legs to support the glass sheet. The camera will lie on its back facing directly upward (without a mirror).Light the book page spread from either side of the camera at 45° to the surface of the glass to avoid glare and reflections. This is standard lighting for copy work.On the glass you will put marks to align the book after you lift the book to turn the page after each shot.After the capture, you would import, crop, and paginate your page series for reading.The set-up while simple will take you some time to align and test. Your biggest challenge will be the counterintuitive positioning of the lighting to be even. You will need a means of making your set-up solid enough (tripod/duct tape, etc.) to remain in alignment throughout the project.A shutter release will be handy. A tripod will be handy. Maybe you can borrow or rent.The reason for doing this "upside down" is to compensate for the different thicknesses of each side of the book as you progress through it. The middle is no problem since the thicknesses are the same at that point. The weight of the book will keep it flat most of the time.Optimal lighting will be even on either side of the book facing upward toward the centre of the page spread.Good luck, You probably won't try to do this twice.

How to fold sheets after ironing?
After the sheet is ironed flat, gather the four corners in one hand while using your free hand to pull the folds with a bit of tension. This makes the sheet 1/4 its spread size. Grip the sheet in this way and shake to set the folds. Place the quartered sheet on your bed and continue to fold it gathering the sides until you have the desired folded size.< —————— >Most all sheets have a trim or different treatment for the head-end and for the foot of the bed-end.One way to start is by putting the two corners of the head-end together, overlapping them precisely and holding them together with your strong hand.Work you way along the length of the sheet until you get to the other end and do the same thing without letting go of the two corners you have.Match the four corners as shown in the diagram or if the sheet has become twisted straighten it out at this point and gather the four corners. Hold them tightly.With your free hand, pull the folds out, straightening them. Let the sheet hang so that you can grip along the top to shake it, setting the folds.In the diagram, I'd be holding the corners with my right hand and using my left to pull the top of the sheet taught in the direction of the arrows.It will look similar to the diagram only more carefully aligned.

Signing a new credit card
Banks and financial institutions prefer the miserly thin line you dislike. Forgers love thick lines that disguise small irregularities in a bogus signature. It's VERY difficult to forge a signature using a fine-lined writing instrument such as a ball-pointed pen.Stop into a bank branch and use one of their pens next time you need to sign your John Bull. It won't cost you a pence and you're assured of using the proper tool.Signature authentication is not there for legibility or aesthetics. It's there to spot differences and irregularities.

How to fight the heat during summertime?
Wet your bodyPour some (cold) water on your arms, legs, face and neck. This way, when the water will evaporate, it will take energy from your body and you will feel cold, just like when you come out of a swimming pool.The only problem with this method is that you'll have to repeat it every 5-10 minutes. I suggest that you always keep a bucket of water and a towel close to you, so you don't have to go to the tap nonstop.
Turn down the noise
Yes. You will get less noise by using both of them together in combination.Sound, as you recall from high-school science, is the differences of air pressure produced by a moving mass.An air-pressure wave pushes on our ear drum and produces the sensation we call sound. Big differences produce loud sounds and small differences, soft sounds. If we don't like the sound, we call it noise.Ear plugs can partially block the air pressure that enters our ear canal. Nothing is perfect. The more effective the block, the better the ear plugs reduce the pressure difference. We experience a reduction in volume since the seal isn't perfect and the insulation of the plug isn't perfect either. Let's say the plugs reduce the sound by one half.Ear protectors surround the ear with sound deadening insulation inside a cup that fits over each ear. Let's say the protectors also reduce the sound by one half.Each device cuts the pressure by half. Together the two will reduce the sound pressure waves by half of a half. That's equal to one-quarter.Sound insulation is additive. You can multiply the sound deadening numbers to find out the sound deadening capabilities of them in combination.The kind people at explainthatstuff.com go into the details with more detail about the mathematical relationship when you combine materials.
Revive gel pens that stop working?
Some pens have a clearly visible ventilation hole. I have had success blowing into this hole while scribbling.  Choose your spectators carefully.
Fix ear cup foam and leather
The way the cover edge is cut (in VVVVV shape), shows is not glued into the cup—it's a "press-fit" which means it is held in place between two plastic pieces inside the cup by pressure. There's no glue normally used for assembly.I see NO trace of glue in your photos (which are very good, by the way).The problem appears to be due to a fault in manufacturing. I think you have a "lemon."They should be replaced by the manufacturer for free. When you return the set, tell them they "came apart." This is not an uncommon problem.Otherwise they look in great condition which strengthens my opinion. There is no sign of mis-use or abuse.Important: Find out before you attempt to repair them or the manufacturer could deny responsibility.
How to keep track of how many uses a razor blade has left
What I do is place 4 tiny rubber bands around the handle and each time I use I remove one. I hate going to shower and find I have a dull razor.
Turn down the noise
Yes, as you observed with shooters, layering your hearing protection is a common (and effective) way to increase your level of hearing protection.The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requires that all safety devices used for noise reduction be labeled with a noise reduction rating (NRR) to quantify their effectiveness. Even though NRR is expressed in decibels (dB), it is important to understand that hearing protectors DO NOT reduce the surrounding levels by that amount. You can do the math (see below(1)), but for the sake of this post, know that the higher the NRR number, the greater the capacity for noise reduction.Layering Noise ReductionIf you are layering you hearing protection, it's also important to note that layering noise protection is not additive (i.e. 33 dB + 29 dB ≠ 62 dB reduction), nor is the noise reduced by a fixed percentage. The exact math is outside the scope of this post, but with your average safety device (with an NRR of about 20-33db), the math will work out to about 5 dB reduction with a second layer. (1) For anyone interested in the measurements:OSHA defines what noise levels warrant hearing protection to assure safe working conditions. Excessive noise is generally defined as exposure to 85 or more decibels of sound over an 8 hour period. But if the ambient noise exceeds those levels, the amount of time until damage can occur will decrease.To calculate the noise reduction, you can get a pretty good approximation by taking the NRR rating, subtract 7, and then divide by 2. For example, if you have a piece of machinery operating at 110 dB with hearing protection rated at 33 NRR, the reduction would look like this:110 dB - (33 - 7) / 2  110 dB - 13= 97 dB You can then use the chart above to determine if addition noise protection is necessary.There's obviously little downside to being overly conservative when it comes to protecting your hearing. I tend to use it even if I don't absolutely need it; it's just a good habit. If you are occasionally working with something particularly loud, you can double up the methods of protection… but if you do this often, it is best to just buy one, convenient piece of protection that will handle those levels. If you are concerned about blocking out the "normal" noises as a matter of safety (communicating with people, hearing alarms, etc), then you might want to consider investing in some good electronic ear protection (search). Devices like these will provide an effective reduction of loud noises while allowing (or even amplifying) the normal sounds you might want to hear. That's pretty cool.I use electronic hearing protection almost exclusively. When I am working with loud equipment (or things that go <boom>), I want to be able to hear the things going on around me. When the equipment goes off, I don't have to remove my hearing protection or remember to put it back on again. When it starts to get noisy, it's just there. And I like to assure that I can continue to communicate normally with the people or things around me. 
How to Remove Colour Stains from Clothes
It takes "elbow grease": a lot of gentle rubbing with detergent and a toothbrush, assuming the color is water based. Scrub with the grain of the material and at 90 degrees, to remove insoluble particles. If this is solvent based, you'll need an organic solvent such as naphtha or bug & tar remover with xylene or toluene. Be careful, those are flammable and a bit toxic!
How to remove really old masking tape?
I stupidly used masking tape to stick SD cards to my desktop so I wouldn't misplaced them. Only meant to leave it for a day or two, but a month later when I  was ready to use them there was tape residue on the cards and desktop border. WD40 on a cotton ball wiped the residue off the cards without and desktop with no damage to either. And it was instantaneous!
Muffling phone vibration at work
The Samsung Galaxy models can change the intensity of the vibration through the settings menu.  I don't have your specific phone, but it should be located somewhere in Settings. According to this forum on Android Central, you can change vibration intensity by:Swiping down from the top of the screen, revealing the notification shade.Tapping on the settings button in the top right corner.Tapping on the Sounds and Vibration Button. (Image from androidcentral.com)Swiping down to reveal the notification shade.Tap on settings -> sounds and vibration.Tap on vibration intensity.From this screen you can adjust vibration in three categories: Incoming call, Notifications, and Vibration Feedback (when you tap on the screen). Move a corresponding slider left to decrease vibration intensity or right to increase it.
Muffling phone vibration at work
Perhaps you could try a square of felt or rubber underneath your phone. A thick piece of felt would be my top choice, as it's used for sound dampening frequently.  It should still emit enough of a buzz that you would feel it, but it wouldn't disturb your office mates.  If you don't care about how it looks on your desk, you could always try a folded up washcloth, or a microfiber rag.  Btw, you can find any of those items at a local hardware store, I just included the home depot links as examples. Hope this helps!
How can I repair cracked LDPE without a plastic welder?
Don't use grocery shopping bags.  They are HDPE, not LDPE. I'm not sure about ldpe but nothing sticks to hdpe.If you are sure it is ldpe then try the plastic welding or gorilla glue for plastic. 
How to Remove Colour Stains from Clothes
Too late for this time; but, getting the pants to a professional cleaner ASAP is the best first option.If you've let the pants dry before you have completely removed the stain, there's a good chance you will never get the paint out.Before you start, it's important to find out what the material is that you want to remove. Read the label and note what the stuff is made of and the manufacturer's coordinates. Contact the manufacturer for what to use and how to treat your pants. Most of the time, they can advise you what to do and how to do it. No? Then do as much research on the Web as you can. Don't accept the first answers but compare answers for the ones that seem to make sense and are in agreement with each other.If you've already washed the pants and the stain reappears in a different colour stain (brown, say) appears before drying, drying will set (make it permanent) the stain remaining. It's probably the paint "vehicle" (the liquid stuff that the pigment has been mixed in) causing the stain. If the stain is the same colour, continue with a second treatment, and maybe a third. Rinse liberally with water to remove particle rather than scrubbing them into the fabric.Scrubbing one part of your pants will damage the area so don't rub hard.Only dry the pants if the stain is not visible when wet.If (when) your efforts to remove the stain are not successful, permanent white laundry markers are available that might work to cover the remaining stain. Apply the white dye by daubing the pen rather than rubbing back-and-forth. You want the white to sink into the fibres thoroughly. Let the marker dry completely for maximum effect.Good luck.If you were wearing black pants, Murphy's Law states that you would have been trying to remove white poster colour instead. Sometimes, you just can't win.
How to light a match?
I am a long time camper and backpacker and have always kept my matches in a small plastic water proof container. Right now they are in an old prescription bottle. If/when the striker strip wears out or gets otherwise damaged I just add a small strip of fine sandpaper attached to a popsicle stick into the container. Easy, light weight and it works really well.
How can I get the smell of garlic off my hands?
Lather up with a bit of soap then run both hands along the faucet. This will remove the smell of garlic and onions. 
What is the best way to light a hard-to-reach candle wick without burning your finger?
Use a long thin candle (often called a "taper").  These are made in lengths up to a foot (30 cm), and can reach far down inside the glass of a poured candle like the one in the photo.
How to color water milky/white, - non-molding, non-sinking?
Anything you can suspend in water that will look white will be a particulate of some kind (like paint pigment).  Any particulate larger than colloidal size will fall out of suspension over time.  Dyes will stay dissolved (as food coloring will) but dyes don't have the property of reflection, so can't look white.The best I can suggest is colloidal chalk, which is produced by a reaction between lime water and carbon dioxide.  Children's chemistry sets used to include instructions on how to make lime water, and you can blow your breath through the solution to provide the carbon dioxide.An alternative solution would be to find a way to recirculate the water, so that whatever you suspend (water color pigment, for instance) will stay suspended rather than settling out.  An aquarium pump and airstone is one option.  You will surely have trouble, over time, with algae growth that will turn your pretty white water green, brown, or reddish, but there are algicides you can add to the water to slow or prevent this (they're sold for fountains, to keep them from filling with pond scum, and for water beds).
How to color water milky/white, - non-molding, non-sinking?
You could try adding something to milk to sterilize it. Household bleach may work, but may also turn it clear (bleach turns coloured things white, but I'm not cure if it turns white things clear). Campden tablets (sodium metabisulfite) as used by homebrewers for sterililising might be a better choice.You didn't say what you need this for, so I don't know if it has to be a liquid or just look like a liquid. I have heard that food photographers will use PVA glue instead of real milk.
How to color water milky/white, - non-molding, non-sinking?
Commenting on another answer gave me the idea to use an anis spirit (ouzo, sambuca, pastis, raki) mixed with water. The ouzo-effect results in a milky solution which, according to the Wikipedia article, is very stable due to the small particle size in the range of microns and the chemical interplay. I will try this (and suggestions in the other answers) out and update the answer (comment on answers).
How to color water milky/white, - non-molding, non-sinking?
The stuff only has to look milky; not be milky to achieve your goal.When I shoot liquids for advertising that I want to glow (or look like they do) such as a glass of frosty beer or a jar of marmalade jam, etc, I put a reflector card behind the subject and let the light show through the liquid.Using this technique allows me to vary the lighting in a very controlled way that mixing unknown substances don't. If your liquid stuff is too thick or too thin you won't achieve the effect you're striving for. All you have to do is slightly angle the reflectors for each test tube or flask in your set-up.Product photographers have been doing this for years.If you choose the colours for the card reflectors, you can get any colours you want sitting right next to each other. Green next to fluorescent red is easy to achieve this way without using coloured liquids at all. For white, use a white card. For blue, use a blue one, etc.Trim the cards carefully so they don't show.LED lights are adjustable but you'll find the stray light hard to harness. Different hues of stray light will mix giving you neutrals which will diminish your intended effect. You'll see the problems in the final shot.If you were shooting functional props for motion pictures, your way would be necessary due to handling by the talent, angles for shots would be uncontrolled, and the lighting problems for that situation are difficult.
How can I react to an acne, without getting any marks on my face?
A quick solution for that one pimple that pops up, put a dab of toothpaste on it before going to bed, by morning it should be well on its way to healing.Not gel toothpaste , but pasty paste. This is not for a face full of pimples, just an occasional one.
How to remove ice from windshield
When I parked outside I would drape a towel over the driver side of the windshield. Even if it rains and freezes, the fabric will not freeze to the glass, and will keep condensation from forming and turning to ice on the glass. 
How can you estimate the fill-state of an opaque bottle?
When you first buy it, you could transfer it to a clear glass bottle. It won't be as attractive as the bottle it comes in, but it would definitely solve the issue!(You could always print out a Bailey's label and attach it to your clear glass bottle, so it still has a good appearance.)
How can I get rid of the tiny fish-bone stuck in my throat upon eating fish?
Well! It all depends on the nature at which the bone is stuck to your throat, and its distance from your mouth. For me, after taking a full orange, I tried reaching it carefully with my index finger, as it was close to my salivary gland, and it came off without stress. Well I think you should also try to see if you can reach it with your finger, I wouldn't advice the use of anything other than the finger. Using your Finger helps you to be more careful, than when you use other objects. If it doesn't work for you, I guess you gonna have to try other given methods then.
How can you estimate the fill-state of an opaque bottle?
Use a long straw or chopstick to help measure the contents of your opaque bottle. It will need to be longer than the bottle is tall.Insert the stick into the mouth of the bottle. While a chopstick will allows you to more easily tell where the wetness in the bottle is, a straw will require you to remove it fast enough that the drops are still clinging to the side of the straw (I am assuming that the straw will be made of nylon or plastic).A variation of this technique uses a weight on a string. The weight will need to be heavy enough to make a sound when it bottoms out so that you can get an accurate measurement. Use something that is safe, not lead sinkers used for fishing.UpdateAs noted by Ghost in the comments, you can form a seal around the top of the straw after it bottoms out. Remove the straw with the seal in place, bringing the liquid with it.
How can you estimate the fill-state of an opaque bottle?
Blow across the top of the bottle like a jug in a jug band. If the noise is high, the bottle is full. If the noise is low, the bottle is empty. In between, the bottle is in between. Over time, when you listen to the various sounds your bottle makes, you can get a feel for how full it is.Perhaps save a completely empty bottle to compare the sound that indicates you'll need to head to buy more Bailys.If you were very serious about this, you can plot a frequency vs liquid graph.  To do this, take an old empty bottle that is that same as the one you want to measure, and:Add 100 mL of water to the bottleBlow into the bottle to hear the noiseMatch the sound your bottle makes with the online tone generator to determine the sound's frequency.Make a chart with frequency you found in #3 under the "x" and "100 mL" under a "y".Return to step #1 until the bottle is full!Make a graph with frequency on the x axis and the liquid volume on the y axis, and then post it on your refrigerator or near where you store your opaque bottle. Then, when you want to determine how full(empty) your Bailey's is, just blow in your bottle consult the graph.
How can you estimate the fill-state of an opaque bottle?
Tap the side of the bottle with your knuckle.The sound changes slightly if you tap against liquid as against air.So, tap repeatedly moving your knuckle from the bottom up, when the note changes, that is the liquid level.
How do I get a new ball pen to flow?
It is very often that the ball point pen that we purchase may not be having smooth ink flow. So I usually rub it against window pane, until I am satisfied. Window pane I meant is shown below. Also do remember to clean it if ink is present on glass. This heats up nib of pen and the related portion of solid ink if any present.Thus making flow of ink smoother.
How to permanently fix deity's idol on car dashboard?
For a start, if your car sits in direct sun for an hour or more with the windows closed, it's likely the interior will get hot enough to melt the idol, never mind the wax used to adhere it to the dashboard.  Further, there are few if any adhesives other than wax that will stick to wax.  The only one I know that's likely to work is RTV silicone, the kind that smells like vinegar while it cures.Assuming there isn't some significance to the material of the idol, you should probably first get a more durable idol, made of a hard plastic like polystyrene or acrylic.  Either of these materials can be glued with cyanoacrylate ("super glue") or polyurethane cement ("Gorilla Glue"), assuming your dash material is compatible with those adhesives (it most likely is).  These plastics are still subject to warping in the temperatures of a car interior in the sun, but will stand up much better than wax or the waxy feeling polyethylene.
How can you estimate the fill-state of an opaque bottle?
With the bottle closed, give it a good shake.  With a little practice, you can estimate how much is left by the sound and feel of the sloshing.This method won't be as accurate as a weight measurement on a good scale, but it will be more accurate than gaging the weight by feel alone.Obviously, this is not a good method to use with carbonated liquids.
How to permanently fix deity's idol on car dashboard?
Rather than fixing your effigy to the car dashboard directly, you can securely affix a small tray, cup, or other attractive protective container that it can sit in safely and be displayed prominently.A good container will be a snug-enough fit that doesn't need any adhesive to hold the effigy itself.If you cannot find a perfect fit, you can use plasticine to hold the idol on its platform for proud display.Children use plasticine (modeling clay) to make shapes to play with. You can get in most any toy store. Use small amounts of it to discreetly hold the effigy to the platform securely for as long as you want. Plasticine is safe for children, comes in many different colours, does no damage to anything it touches, doesn't melt in the heat, and doesn't change (harden or soften) over the time you will own your car.You may discover that using the plasticine alone to hold the idol, you do not need anything else, in fact.
How to make alarm audible over air conditioner?
Put your iPhone™ in a cup beside you. The cup will act as a directional amplifier to make the sound seem louder and directional. Point the cup toward where your head is for maximum effect. Maybe that will do the trick. You may have to experiment a bit to find the optimal position for the cup/glass and your iPhone™.
How can you estimate the fill-state of an opaque bottle?
If you keep the bottle in the refrigerator like my wife does, when you take it out the condensation on the side of the bottle will tell you the level exactly within a few minutes.In a rush? Breathe on the bottle.
How to safely display an electric car's battery pack at a car show?
Display your battery pack through a window.A sheet of rigid plexiglass will be transparent enough to see everything but stop anything from touching the dangerous parts of the display.In addition, you can attach notes, arrows, and other marks to make the display more informative.(I'm a science teacher.)
Remove ants from honey
Simply take a spoon and scoop them out bit by bit. They will be on the top and close to one edge since they can't negotiate very far in the goo. Rinse and dry the spoon after each scoop to clean it.Did it yesterday to a seven pound plastic pail full of honey. There were some honey worshipers gathered at the edge of the lid where I was sloppy pouring some last time I used the container.Put the lid on securely to avoid the problem. Rinse off the container to discourage the critters in the future.
How can you estimate the fill-state of an opaque bottle?
Microwaving it for thirty seconds to a minute (depending on an estimation of how much is in it) and taking it out will let you feel where it is warm (the liquid will warm faster) and how high the drink goes.And this is sort of a no-brainer, but couldn't you just pour it into a cup, then back in the bottle to see how much it is?
How to get water out of ears?
Use gravity.Place your head flat upon a pillow or a towel with your head to one side. Within a few minutes, the water will drain out of its own accord. Then, turn your head to face in the other direction with your other ear down to drain that one.It's that simple. It's safer that putting anything into your ear. It works.
How to get water out of ears?
One of my lifeguarding buddies shared this one with me. Just turn your head sideways (so your ear is facing the ground) and jump up and down a couple times. Comes right out, and it works pretty quick, usually on the first jump or two.
Revive gel pens that stop working?
I have tried this and it worked for me.Gel pens have a long tube like structure commonly called the 'refill'.The tip of the tube is occupied by the nib.Many a times I have seen that the nib stops working as it gets easily damged.This nib can be removed and only the plastic tube with ink is left.Note here,that the nib not just only mean the metallic part but also the plastic casing holding it.  Use nib of empty refill for replacement :- You can remove the nib of the non working gel pen you are talking about with your hands or by some sort of instruments by tilting it left and right and slowly pulling it up.It is better if you do it in a washbasin.Also remember to hold the tube horizontal,for the viscous ink wont flow away.Now take another empty refill,take out its nib in the same way and insert it in the desired refill.Before that,make sure to check the compatibility of the nib of this empty refill with the one you opened.  You can use alcohol as it is a good non polar solvent :- Alcohol is a good non polar solvent and you can easily dissolve ink in it.So, you can open the nib like I mentioned above,use a dropper and put 1-2 drops of alcohol on it from the tip where there is ink.Shake the refill after closing the nib.If the ink were clogged,it would flow smoothly now.
Make suction cups suck
The seal is being broken by air working its way through the suction cup itself as well as at the edges of the seal. Usually, flexible but also slightly porous materials are used to make suction cups and flexible seal containers and lids. It isn't easy to find an inexpensive material that is both air-tight and flexible enough to hold well for long.One fix would be to treat the suction cup itself to help "plug" the leaky plastic as well as the seal. Many things that you'd think you could use will also soften the cup material and lose the seal strength.If you need a long-term solution, consider using a semi-permanent adhesive rather than relying on a mechanical solution.
How can I drain the water from a saucepan of pasta without a colander?
You can have my colander. I found a lifehack and don't need mine now.  I use a plate to help drain the water; but, the real hack is HOWI put a salad plate into the pasta pot. It is slightly smaller in diameter than the sauce pan by about 10mm. Put it face-down over the pasta before you tip the pot to drain it. The small plate will hold the pasta in place as the water flows past the plate on either side. Hold the pot handle with one hand and use the edge of the lid in your other hand to hold the hot plate from falling out as you tip the pot to drain the water from the sauce pan.Not only is this hack much faster than using a colander, it's easier to clean a plate as it has no nooks, crannies, and holes. (Can you tell that I did this a few minutes ago?) Using this method will allow you to pour the water as fast as you wish without losing a single noodle. After you do it once, you won't even have to watch what you're doing. It's physics. It's automatic. I don't use my colander now for anything more than washing vegetables with a spray attachment.It's also more efficient than a colander. When you use this method, after you remove the plate the completely drained pasta is left sitting in the sauce pan ready for you to add the sauce, oil, and spices and return directly to the stovetop if you want.All done perfectly without losing a noodle in one step without a colander. Try it once and you'll never do it any other way.
How do I remove hard-to-remove ink from my hands?
A Mr. Clean Magic Eraser (dampened with water) works very well, and isn't hard on the skin.
How can you estimate the fill-state of an opaque bottle?
Shake the bottle. Depending on the amount of liquid and its viscosity you will get totally different haptic and acoustic sensations.A full bottle will have a great momentum and makes no sound. A half filled one will show a "delayed" momentum when the liquid splashes against the container and will produce intense sounds.A nearly empty one will make different sounds and won't show a noticable "delayed" momentum.This allows for rough and fast estimations, but if properly practised I guess you can feel the content with an error of let's say 20%.
Heat water in two buckets using one immersion rod
I think that the image will clarify your question connect two bucket via a tube. It will exchange cold and hot water in the buckets. The result is that both buckets of water will get heated.
How to get water out of ears?
Here are some tips for you to get water out of ears. An easy way is to chew or yawn. If you want to use gravity, there should be some steps: Tilt your head sidewaysHold the ear that the water got into parallel to the groundPlace the palm of your hand against your earPress it hard for a couple of secondsAfter that, remove your hand quickly. The fluid will be dislodged by a temporary vacuum that has just formed.Remove the water draining from the ear by a cotton ear bud very carefully.Note: Do not insert the ear bud in the ear.
Prevent cables and wires from twisting
It's not a good idea to coil power cables.Coiling power cables creates a magnetic field. The more turns and the tighter (neater) the cable is, the stronger the magnetic field.Data cables have built-in twists to minimize electrical interference from such outside sources. Even so, data cables have more errors when they are near magnetic fields than when there is no magnetic interference. A disorganized random jumble of cables with no coils is preferable from a data integrity point of view. Jumbles of cables collect dust and dirt and are difficult to clean. They can be a problem when you are trying to troubleshoot.What to do?Put the whole mess into a clean laundry or garbage bag and tie the bag so that cables are contained. For maintenance, you can dust around and under the bag. Leave only as much cable as you need outside the bag. Long ends can be secured as shown here by others.To find and trace the cables, label both ends of the cables with matching tags by colour, letters, numbers, or names before you start the project to make them easy to locate. 
How do I take a 360 degree photo of myself without asking someone else to do it for me?
To do this yourself, you'll need some equipment whether you make or borrow it.You'll need a swivel chair to sit on, a means of holding your "camera" pointed at you as a tripod does, and a way to trip the shutter button of your "camera" to capture the images from eye-level and from above.Your head and shoulders should practically fill the frame.You'll take all the photos of yourself while sitting on the chair as you turn your seat on its axis. Two cameras working simultaneously can get the two series at once. One camera will make the two sessions difficult to match; but, it may be possible with varying degrees of success.Try to provide a continuous even background for your portrait series. Fix the base of the seat so that you can minimize any movement sideways as you turn. A featureless background will lessen the possibility of the software substituting points from the background for your head.The lighting should be even, indirect, and diffuse.Shoot enough images (minimum 12 per camera position—more is better) so that enough points to track in each shot can be found in the next shot. The software will "look" for common matching coordinates in each image pair, pair-by-pair. More points that match with minimal change per image will allow finer stitching with better results in the plot.TIP: Put Post-It notes or something similar on the walls at the same height around the room to help you gauge how much to turn your seat and to have something to look at and focus on for more consistent results.That's it, simple but definitely NOT easy. Good Luck.
How to permanently fix deity's idol on car dashboard?
Since your deity exhibits such a nice base plate, you can make use of it to fixate it. You need something which get's a good grip on the baseplate and which can be fixed on the dashboard itself.You can mold some sugru around the baseplate of the deity and stick it to a piece of sheet metal. The sheet metal again can be fixed to the dashboard by any adhesive you like to use.The sugru is so soft I assume it can be cut away easily to free your deity's foot if you want to remove it later. If your deity is really made from wax the sugru shouldn't stick to it. If you want to make sure, you can apply a drop of oil with a cloth to the baseplate of the deity before molding arond the sugru.
What is the quickest way to cool down a room-temperature drink without pouring it over ice?
An old school method will cool your canned drink instantly. Find a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, the kind with the big horn on it that projects the gas. Set the can on a surface, preferably outside. Cover it with the fire extinguisher spout and blast it once or twice. It will be ice cold in less than 5 seconds !
How to store bananas and keep fruit flies away?
IF you already are seeing fruit flies around your bananas, try this to get rid of them quickly:Get a glass, fill it about 1/4 - 1/2 full of RED wine.  Wrap the glass in saran (clear plastic wrap) and use a toothpick to poke about a dozen or so holes in the top of the wrap, which will allow access into the cup for fruit flies.  Put the glass with the punctured wrap right next to the bananas, or in any other place in the kitchen that you are seeing the flies.  You may want to use multiple cups.The fruit flies will be VERY attracted to the scent of the red wine.  They will enter the cup through the holes you punched in the top, but will not be able to navigate back out.  I'm not sure why, but this is common for fruit flies.  They cannot get back out of the trap once they get in.  Chances are, the fruit flies will not be interested in getting out any way - they will be so attracted to the red wine that they will land in it, drink it, become intoxicated, and drown in the wine.  This is even better than the "Apple Cider Vinegar and Dish Detergent" method of controlling fruit flies.  In fact, I did this just last night, placing 3 cups in the kitchen (we have a HUGE swarm right now due to an undiscovered piece of food getting stuck to the sink drain).  In one cup, I counted about 11 dead fruit flies.  In the second cup, 7.  In the third cup I had 5 dead flies.  I have only seen one or two stragglers in the kitchen since then.  It really works well!  
How to get water out of ears?
I have faced this issue and triggered its solution myself that worked for my friends too.Follow these steps:Move your face 90 degree rightwards so that your chin is directly above your right shoulder.Gently bend down so that air passes through your ear hole and throw the water out.Repeat the above steps for your left ear. If you did not get it on first try, repeat it. The hidden advantage is that it brings back rhythm of breathe for asthma patients.
Safe storage of blender blades
Osterizer™ blades exactly fit the standard regular-mouth "Mason" jar dimensions. They were part of the standard sizes agreed upon by manufacturers of canning and food processing equipment back in 1868. This is a "good thing™."Mason™ jars are also known by other names such as Ball, Bocal, Bernadin, Kerr, Crown, Corona, and others. They are commonly available in almost all supermarkets, hardware stores, and garden stores in North America.Place the sharp blades face-down inside a small mason preserves jar and screw the rim closed to secure the blades inside safe and clean, nick free. You don't need the insert since the base of the blades is the same size. You can choose to leave it in to cover the bottom of the blender blade assembly.Use a small jar for each of the blades you don't keep in the container itself.TIP: You can use "mason" jars on your Osterizer blender directly as the container for your sauces, smoothies, and blends. There's no cleanup of the unnecessary regular glass pitcher-jar.
How to get water out of ears?
A hair dryer should evaporate the water. Just point it at your ear at the warmest heat setting you can handle (which might not be very warm!!), and let the air blow into your ear for a few minutes.Be careful that the sound of the hair dryer's motor, or just the wind rushing into your ear, is not too loud, because that could either leave you with a ringing ear or possibly even damage your eardrum.
How can I remove hardened masking tape on car surface?
Try something like the Spot-X No Scratch Pad with a liberal amount of alcohol.  If alcohol doesn't cut it, try acetone (commonly sold as nail polish remover, be sure and get the clear variety) instead.  Do it in the shade / indoors, allow the liquid to penetrate fully ...I am not affiliated with the manufacturer or marketer(s) of this product.
How can you estimate the fill-state of an opaque bottle?
Put it into a big bowl of water.  The emptier it is, the higher it will float. 
How can I drain the water from a saucepan of pasta without a colander?
I have a strainer but I prefer an easier method that doesn't require you to remove the pasta from the pan.If you have a plate that fits over the pot completely put it on top.Grip pot and plate together on sides where handles are.Pour out water with out pouring on your handsShake once water has stopped flowing. Set down and repeat.
How can I label my left and right ear buds?
You really only need to label ONE of them, and then remember whether that's the left one or the right one.  Since they're black, you could try marking it with either correction fluid (like Wite-Out or Liquid Paper), or a SILVER permanent pen.Note that you'll probably need to reapply this every few weeks, as it will rub off if you handle them a lot.
How can I drain the water from a saucepan of pasta without a colander?
While I see most answers say to "use a plate", I have always found it easier to use a cutting board.  Because the cutting board is flat and straight, it allows for a better seal with the edge of the pot.  Simply hold the cutting board flush with the top of the pot, allow for a small gap between the cutting board and the edge of the pot to allow water to escape but not the pasta, and slowly tilt the pot to let water pour out.  This is the same idea as using a plate or the lid to the pot, just easier in my opinion.
How to make neat, round pancakes
The most inexpensive way to make round pancakes is to pour the batter from a height of at least 12" from the pan. Perfect, round, pancakes every time.
How can I remove hardened masking tape on car surface?
I always used vegetable oil or some other cooking oil to loosen and remove adhesive. Put it on the spot where the tape is, and let it rest for a while.  If it is normal masking tape, that is, made of paper, the oil should pass through it to the adhesive. Once it encounters the adhesive, which is oil based it will dissolve it.After waiting, rub it with your finger (no scratching!). The tape and adhesive should ball up and fall off.
How would one digitize a thick book into a PDF version in the most time-efficient way, using only a camera and a computer?
Here's what I did recently:Photograph every page individually in the sunshine with a digitalcamera/ smart phone. Make sure there are no shadows on the page, andhold them as flat as possible with your finger. Photograph the pages from the first page to the last pageCopy all the jpg files from the digital camera to a single directory on a computer.Download a trial version of Abby Fine Reader OCRUse the Abby Fine Reader OCR to convert all the images to MS Word.MS word (or open office) can convert it into a PDF or other file type. You can also confirm that the words were converted correctly.For me, it took me about 20 seconds per page to take a photo, for 50 pages, so about 15 minutes.  Then, about 3 minutes to copy the images to my old computer. To convert the images to MS word, it took me about 5 minutes to figure out how to do it, then maybe 3 minutes for the software to complete its work. So About 25 minutes for 50 pages? That means for your 600 page book, it will take about 6 hours or so.Abby Fine did a nice job for me, even when the pages were bent near the binding, and the letters were distorted, it was able to OCR fairly well. I'd say that if the print is clear, there are about 10 mistakes in a page. I am generally able to determine how to correct the text as I read it; maybe once in 5 pages I can't figure out what is correct from context, and need to refer to the original image. For equations & images in the text, it is able to stick a bitmap image in the word file.Using this method gave me a reasonably small file size with a limited number of errors.Honestly, it is fairly fun. Not a horrible chore.(I am not affiliated with Abby in any way, with the exception of being  a trial software user.)
How can I remove hardened masking tape on car surface?
Diethyl Ether is an excellent solvent for many contact adhesives, and does not attack most original auto paints (though it might remove touch-up paint or lacquer). However, it is extremely flammable, easily ignited by just the heat from the engine or muffler even after the car has been shut for a while.If you do want to try it, most pressurized engine starter sprays contain a high proportion of ether, and there is no danger of flashback (flame going back into the container).Work outdoors, away from anything flammable such as a house or dried grass. Do not wear clothing that might easily catch fire.Make sure the car engine is cool and avoid turning on or off electrical devices (e.g. opening a car door, which turns on dome light).Test the ether spray on an inconspicuous spot to see if it attacks paint. Use only a brief spray.Spray directly on the masking tape and peel before it dries, in just a few seconds. Again, work on only a small area at a time that can be treated with a brief spray.Spray ether on the "stickum" left on the finish after removing the tape and wipe the finish immediately with fresh cloth or paper towels; repeat as needed.N.B. This is potentially dangerous. Though I've safely used ether to remove tape residue, your safety cannot be guaranteed.
Sleeping in a noisy environment
View enduring noise at night as a form of self-improvement.The best long term solution is to learn to sleep in a noisy environment. This is a requirement for anyone who has moved from the suburbs/countryside to a densely populated urban environment.It takes about 3 weeks  - you will be tired during this time - but after this you will adjust to the new environment. I personally now have difficulty sleeping in a quiet environment after years of living in cities!
How to reduce eye strain caused by constant exposure to computer screen?
It is common among computer users. There a lot means to reduce it. I suggest you following methods:1.Use a plain glass coated with anti glare coating.2.Try to give your eyes a fresh water wash at frequent time gaps.3.Do blink your eyes at frequent time gap.4.Before sleep, wash you eyes with a medium cold water.
How to reduce eye strain caused by constant exposure to computer screen?
When my eyes become strained from looking at screens I often use eye drops.  "Artificial tears" tend to work well, although there are more expensive alternatives.Also, dimming the brightness delays the symptoms for me.  Also, a dimmer screen in my opinion is easier on the eyes.  When I have a text document open, or another program with a bright white background, dimming the brightness can make a world of difference.  It reduces the severity of a bright white screen blasting in your face.  Keep in mind everyone is different.  My eyes are sensitive to bright lights, which is why I find relief from lowering the brightness helps me.  It's very possible you are the same way.
How to get water out of ears?
If you have a problem with swimmer's ear, which can lead to bacterial infection, use a mixture of one part vinegar and one part alchol (10ml vinegar, 10 ml alcohol).  Drop about 5 ml in the ear and allow it to drain out.  My daughter sometimes gets ear infections from playing in the bathtub or swimming.  This was suggested by our pediatrician.
How to reduce eye strain caused by constant exposure to computer screen?
It's your diet that's the problem.In almost every case of eye strain the problem is a lack of vitamin A (Retinol) and or "vitamin" D. (Vitamin D is a hormone and not a vitamin in the conventional sense although it is called "the sunshine vitamin." Vitamin D aids the absorption of vitamin A as well as other nutrition material.)Your eyes "eat" vitamin A as they function. When your eyes feel dry, scratchy, and uncomfortable it is a signal that you are experiencing a kind of malnutrition. Your EYES need the nutrition. You need time to absorb it. You need to eat, and rest to allow your eyes to recover.The visual system is the major benefactor of proper nutrition and enough rest. Improper lighting (fluorescent tubes or any discontinuous source of light) stresses the visual system as much as a long-distance marathon taxes the muscular system. Glare is another stress that consumes more vitamin A as the eye works to resolve the image you are trying to see clearly.Enjoy more foods rich in vitamin A. Many sites such as QUA blog , Michel Pop, and Mercola have suggestions for different delicious foods for meeting your specific nutritional requirements. Search on-line for "foods that can improve vision."—Use dietary supplements only as a last resort and with some guidance from a licensed nutritionist after a detailed consultation. The cost and prescriptions should be tax-deductable as a business expense.After you give your eyes proper nutrition for the amount of work you give them to do, your eye problems will diminish. You will be able to see better in dim light. Loss of dim light vision is also a symptom of a vitamin A deficiency. Fix your diet and YOU'LL SEE.
How to get water out of ears?
This may sound stupid, but it works. Scoop with your hand some water and pour into the ear that is already flooded. Let it stay for a few seconds so as the new water connects with the existing water inside the ear. Then quickly tilt your head the opposite direction sideways, causing the water to flow out of your ear due to inertia. 
How would one digitize a thick book into a PDF version in the most time-efficient way, using only a camera and a computer?
Take the picture of every page or both (taking it using DSLR should take small amount of effort). Ideally when second person will change the pages, so you don't have to take your finger out of the trigger (or setup the right environment and use the remote trigger).Then having a curled photographs, you can use special softwares which can deal with these pages automatically. For more details, please check:Best way to flatten a curled photographed book photograph?
How to reduce eye strain caused by constant exposure to computer screen?
I just recently got a job where I have to stare at a computer for around 8 hours a day.  The first thing I did was lower the brightness on both the monitor and the graphics card nearly all the way.  Not actually all the way, because you have to be able to see it without straining, but a decent amount.I also install f.lux (https://justgetflux.com/) and made my screen warmer, to try and reduce the blue light coming out of it.  That helps quite a bit, and I don't notice the color unless I look at someone else's screen.  It takes a bit to get used to but I think it's worth it.Finally, I have a pair of Gunnar glasses that I wear during the day.  Not all the time, because I don't like 24/7 glasses, but they help too.  They slightly magnify the screen, and reduce ALL blue light (not just from the screen) to help my eyes relax.  They're a bit expensive, so I'm not saying you have to go get some, but I like them for what I do.
Hacky way to keep micro USB firmly in place?
The picture doesn't show the port. You don't describe where on KB the port is, so I can't be very specific. An ideal joint will retain its ability to flex rather than break or disconnect. I don't know how you'd do that with the micro USB cord - some way to maintain a gentle pressure directly towards the port...Anyway, my only concrete suggestion is to glue or tape a 'splint' under the port and then tape (or otherwise fasten - would rubber bands work??) the cord to the splint - similar to how a finger splint immobilizes a finger. As long as the splint is rigidly attached, it should help keep the cord plugged in. Perhaps you should consider a wireless KB...
How to reduce eye strain caused by constant exposure to computer screen?
Practice this simple but effective 20-20-20 exercise.It's really EASY to do and a good habit to adopt.Every TWENTY minutes,look at something TWENTY feet awayfor TWENTY seconds.
How can I remove hardened masking tape on car surface?
I had really good success with WD-40 to remove old hardened gunk from duct tape (used to prevent a broken power window from sliding down). It worked great for removing the residue from the glass and car body. 
How to remove printed labels from the backing easily?
This works on Brother label tapes for sure, but I don't know about others.Take the printed label in between your thumb and fore finger of each hand with the backing side of the tape facing you, gently keep squeezing it and you will see that the waked backing tape is split down the middle, then just flip your thumb nail under the spit and peel off, it takes a few attempts but after a while you will do it first time every time.
How to reduce eye strain caused by constant exposure to computer screen?
If you are using a computer late at night, it is recommended to download an application like F.Lux. It reduces the brightness of the screen on sundown, and removes the light band that produces eye strain/keeps people awake.

Cat Urine & Wood Floor
I would suggest you a series of steps to follow in order to clean you stairs. I would recommend you to do this biweekly.First of all, if you have a carpet at the landing, remove it and give it a clean wash.Please ensure you put something like this as after wash for a nice smell.Now use these liquids to clean wooden floor.After a good dry at sunlight, you can put back carpet on to the landing.For a frequent result, you could use these to remove smell.I am not having any tie up with above products or companies. Please do take them as examples and you can select appropriate substitutes if needed.
How do I take a 360 degree photo of myself without asking someone else to do it for me?
The following process requires only a tie.Tie a tie.Take your phone and switch it to camera mode.Change the mode of camera to 'shutter' (the one that takes a lot of photos on single click)Arrange the direction of back camera yourself so that it points to your face.Now with the same hand, grab tie too.Place your camera held hand from one side.Soon after clicking, move your hand through the path tie forwards you.Please have a lot of trials from bottom, in front of your nose and forehead angle until you are satisfied.At last, you could remove tie from photos. Since it is only said that you require 360 degree photos of your head, tie will not indulge in them.
How to reduce eye strain caused by constant exposure to computer screen?
When I am using my laptop for more than 30 minI would suggest to see a doctor and check your vision first. It may be as simple as dry eyes but IMHO worth checking.A separate note on reducing the brightness.. In very rare cases it is actually dimming that causes a very rare type of photophobia where a person cannot stand  flashing light. Every modern light bulb (including those in LCD screens) flash with a high frequency. Dimming controls time span of every little flash. When you reduce the brightness it flashes more and causes more irritation. In this case an alternative may be to set it to full brightness but reduce the colour components so that the screen does not look bright.

deter badgers from garden
Badgers are stubborn creatures of habit and stronger than they look.  It is unlikely that you have a single badger, the family will forage together following the lead of the boar.In my experience, if you try to block the regular foraging route with a fence, they'll just go through it or under it.  Also, if you did stay up to confront them, they have the patience to wait until you go to bed and will then go on their way.However, as nocturnal creatures, they like the dark.  Set up a motion controlled security light.  It doesn't have to be very bright but if it shines on the badgers, they will take a different route.This won't stop them trying to get to their destination but it may encourage them to go round you.Don't forget that they are a protected species (in the UK at least) and not often seen.  Perhaps the best approach is to learn to enjoy them.
How can you estimate the fill-state of an opaque bottle?
There is yet another method that is more commonly used for propane tanks and vessels with thinner walls. Essentially, you boil some water (2 cups or .5 L) and then pour it slowly down the side of the bottle. This will heat the bottle faster where it is empty, and much more slowly where your delicious Bailey's is still in contact with the bottle. So, if you run your hand down the side of the bottle, you should be able to feel where the temperature change happens.Here is a YouTube video about how to do it with a propane tank:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6U_e7FrC2Y
How do you test if batteries are good?
I touch "+" with tip of my tongue. If battery is dead, it is tasteless, otherwise it's like a lemon. Don't try it with 9 Volts or more - it's painfull. 1.5V is ok.
How to reduce eye strain caused by constant exposure to computer screen?
Reduce eye strain caused by constant exposure to a computer screen by adjusting your working conditions in order of importance.Find the optimal seating (or standing) working position. The science behind those optimal conditions is called Ergonomics. The different distances and angles are best determined by your body proportions. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Adjust what you can to accommodate yourself. Most of this stuff is pretty basic and intuitive. You've probably heard it all before.Before you turn your monitor on, what do you see? On the dark screen do you see reflections of you and your surroundings? If you do, you'll have all these reflections interrupting your screen view. Minimize what is noise, in the visual sense. Move or remove the offending visual interference if you can. Many keep their background dark and wear dark or black to keep visual interference to a minimum.Adjust the lighting conditions to optimal levels for what you're doing. An excellent tutorial on lighting conditions with detailed illustrations and actual research data is The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety Survey — Solutions Fact SheetFinally, Adjust the screen brightness for optimal level. The white level (behind the words you're reading here, right now) should match a piece of white paper lying on the desk beside the monitor screen. More than that increases screen glare. Less than that decreases legibility—contrast.Pick up a piece of paper and hold it beside the screen right now and try it. Make proper adjustment as necessary. Make changes as necessary if the room conditions change. See how much it helps after a few days trial.
How to remove formation due to AC water outlet?
The formation might be calcium carbonate? Does the water drip directly from the AC, or along a rock before it falls?I think to get rid of this sediment buildup, just soak a rag in vinegar, then let the rag sit on the affected area. It should re-dissolve with a mild acid like vinegar.To prevent build-up is a little harder; mainly, try to get the water to drip somewhere else. A short length of hose maybe, to lead it towards a drain? or a stick from a tree touching the water, to convey it to the other side of the railing?
How to remove formation due to AC water outlet?
How can I prevent AC from generating further formations? generally AC units have a port through which water is drained. This water is due to excess air humidity. at the end of port you can attach a pipe which leads water straight to a container (a used bottle is good container as it is very portable).However while using this hack you will need to remember to remove the water out of bottle on daily basis.If you are wondering How would you attach pipe. you can use sealing solutions like m-seal wet set. make sure that the solution is waterproof.
How can I prevent the flame of a matchstick going out as I light a barbecue?
Roll the match between your fingers as you move it - the flame will burn much much stronger and you will be able to move the match to the paper without it going out.
How can I prevent the flame of a matchstick going out as I light a barbecue?
The old smokers' trick used to be to keep the matchbox half open & dip the struck match slightly into the hollow end [the end away from where the open visible matches are] just as the initial flare is dying.This allows the wood to take full hold & then be more wind-resistant.If you do it too early, the fumes from the initial chemical flare will put it straight out.Alternatively, hold two or three matches with the heads offset by about double the length of each head. Strike the first, which will light the second, then the third...Or,  requires advance preparation.  Dip the head end to about ½ way down the stick in candle wax... [carefully, of course]
How to get hair out of a brush
Put a piece of paper in the bottom of the brush, make sure the bristles can go through, or instead of paper( use something that can get wet and stay dry, if you brush your hair wet) after this step brush your hair normal and they once you are ready to pull off the hair rip the paper( or whatever you used) off and your brush should be cleared, then reapply.
Comfortable Ways of Riding a Bike Barefoot
I love bare feet too but can't really get it to work on the mtb I ride -1991 shogun TI - I find havaianas work well though as a compromise and I ride in these year round (Sydney Aus)nearly all the time unless it's a bush track The havaianas upper sole pattern is about the least slippery you can get also they are very lightI have a pair one size down so they stay on my foot when I pull out of the pedal cage So, today, though i happenned to be in a bike shop saw these BBB MTB nylon pedals. $19.99. i thought id give these a try they are nice and light, have a good edge round the front to curl your toes around and out of the box are good for maybe 5 miles. I rode 20 in them (30 km) which exposed a few flaws, notably the sharp edge round the front and the protruding bumps are a bit high for shoeless comfort. 5 minutes with the grinder, i took the edges off and these are so comfy! Even so, 30 km absolutely shoeless- i have never felt so good after a ride.Ill post some photos of my mod if anyone wants.
Air Conditioner/Coolers best substitute
Any cool water bottle or chilled soda pop can pressed up against the neck will cool you down. You alternate left and right side every few minutes. The idea is that the cold fluid against your jugular vein on the left hand side cools the blood entering the brain whereas the right hand side cools the blood exiting the brain and returning to the body. In addition to drinking plenty of fluid until such time as you begin the core of your body return to normal. Don't rely on being thirsty as an indication of level of hydration. You could be dangerously dehydrated well before you become thirsty. Also find shade.If at home you can lie down on a sofa or bed with a fan on you. Lying down you lower the amount of energy you produce and therefore help in cooling. You can spend some time in a tub filled with cool water. Start with tepid first then gradually added cooler water up to your tolerance level.
Air Conditioner/Coolers best substitute
Your own body can be very effective cooling you if the humidity is low enough.A de-humidifier uses coils cool enough to pull water out of the air by condensation. Then, the drier air in your environment will seem much cooler than the humid air at the same temperature.Although you don't need to vent a dehumidifier to the outside, you'll need to periodically remove the water that accumulates as the unit runs. It also uses less power than an air conditioner and makes less noise in operation. It's a great practical alternative to an air conditioners.
How can I prevent the flame of a matchstick going out as I light a barbecue?
Add a small piece of wax paper to the other paper you were using. It lights easily and it will act as a fuse to light the paper that will, in turn, light the BBQ.An alternative is to dribble a bit of wax on the corner of crumpled paper fire-starter scraps 
How can I prevent the flame of a matchstick going out as I light a barbecue?
I would like to suggest you one method:Use camphorSteps:Mostly it will come by a set of cubes. I suggest you to grab it randomly.Place it carefully on grill of barbeque.Light this camphor and with the stick itself, dodge it so that it will fall to wood that you have arranged for burning.The advantage is that, you can save your flame. The camphor is a good conductor of fire. So even if you put some in between wood, it will be an add on.
How can I remove large amounts of duct tape from a door?
I will suggest you a serious of methods. All you need is a blade, spray bottle,oil and some kerosene.By blade, try to peel out edge of tape that is stuck on door.If you can get a spray bottle, take some oil and water mixture.When you start peeling off from door, do not try to give it a full shot. Because, tape may break and you will have to do step 1 again. Instead apply force randomly. In between, if you find it tough to pull, soak adhesive part of tape with liquid taken in spray bottle and wait for it to take action.In the case of oil, I would prefer you to use vegetable oil that you use in your home as a common lubricant. After taking away entire tapes, you can give door a nice rub with kerosene to remove left back adhesive particles.
deter badgers from garden
The most interesting idea to block them from entering your garden, in my opinion would be to plant ginger plant at your fence or at the position in your boundary from which they seems to enter. This idea depends upon geographical nature of your land too, because I dont know whether conditions will support ginger plant over there.Any way, when badgers approach your boundary, they could proabably dig hole under fence.Gingers nature could drive away them as they find ginger as they dig up their path.This is what we do here for badgers. Any way you can not obstruct them completely from entering your boundary because it will be havoc to plant ginger in your garden, but to some extent you can.
Sleeping in a noisy environment
Solution (not a hack): Love 'em or leave 'em.
Cat Urine & Wood Floor
Pet Smart has an enzyme spray that will break down the smell compounds. Not sure if it will damage the wood or not. I used it on painted wood and it didn't hurt the paint...I successfully de-stank a room that had the same thing happen to it.I also used a black light to see where the spots of pee remained, so I could really soak/scrub those areas with the spray.
deter badgers from garden
Substitute steel spikes or lengths of "rebar" concrete reinforcement bars for the missing fence pieces. Drive them into the ground a few inches apart leaving part of each bar a bit higher above the ground as the hole in your fence to block the entrance. Paint them to match your existing fence. Be vigilant and block any entrance you see as soon as you see it made. Eventually, the critters will find another route bypassing your estate.
deter badgers from garden
These tough and fearless critters do not understand subtlety. Theirs is a matter of survival as opposed to yours which is a matter of aesthetics.Solution (not a hack): Your choices are share;—accept coexistence with its inconvenience and unkempt appearance—or, to call an exterminator who will set traps and relocate the offender and family. (I wonder if they really relocate or if it is a euphemism for killing them.)
Transport a washing machine over stairs alone
Unless your name is Bruce Banner and the thought of hiring someone makes you angry, you need help.See if there's an organization near you similar to Seattle's "Millionairs Club" -- they specialize in day labor, staffed by homeless or otherwise disadvantaged men (men only in this case, but that may not always be the case -- tell them what you're doing, they'll make sure the worker they send out is up to the job).  This method will cost you a little, but far less than hiring day labor from a common temp agency.  You'll still want/need straps, but this will give you a second body to carry the other end of the machine.You could use mechanical methods (strap washer to a "sled" and winch it up the stairs, for instance) but its unlikely they'll work well in your apartment building.
How do I staple a few sheets of paper in the middle using a normal stapler?
It can be folded open so you have just the head of the stapler, but no bottom "plate" that is engraved to make sure the staple itself folds shut when you press on it.If you can fold the stapler so that you only have the top, you can staple it on a surface, such as a table, which should make sure that the staple folds.
Killing flies with your bare hands
Catching flies from the air is almost completely a matter of luck, in my experience.If they're lifting off a surface, it helps to know that a housefly has to jump backward in order to lift off -- so at whatever point it becomes alarmed enough to fly, it'll move about a quarter inch (6 mm, give or take) to its rear as it leaves the surface.  This can help either in swatting or catching, because you know in advance the first place it will go.
How do I staple a few sheets of paper in the middle using a normal stapler?
1) Put the paper on a soft but firm surface like a piece of Styrofoam, or even a couple layers of corrugated cardboard (like from a cardboard box).2) Open the stapler.  Position the head where you want the staple to go through the paper.  Quickly smack the stapler head with your hand to stick a staple through the pages, into the soft + firm surface.3) Remove the paper and staple from the soft + firm surface.  The "legs" of the staple will be sticking straight out.  Use the metallic "head" of the stapler  to bend the 2 legs of the staple over flat against the paper.The staple will hold as well as a "normally-stapled" staple does, although the legs may look a little funny.
How do I staple a few sheets of paper in the middle using a normal stapler?
To make a professional looking saddle-stitched dummy folio:Fold the pages you would like to saddle-stitch.Place them face down on a large "pinky" pencil eraser as a base to staple into as it's handy, very sturdy, and maintains a good grip. A good grip is necessary so the staples don't easily come out until you're finished putting the booklet together.Align the open stapler to put the staple into the spine (fold) of the folio.Press the head of the stapler down slowly with the palm of your hand to maintain control of the process and alignment of the document. I've found that you don't need to quickly smack the stapler head. Very little force is necessary going through the fold in fact.Repeat for the second and/or third stitch - move the eraser or use an additional eraser for each "stitch".Pull the folio clear of the eraser(s) to expose the staple "legs."Fold-over the "legs" neatly using anything firm such as a finger nail.There is no way to detect any difference between a hand-stapled "dummy" and a conventional saddle-stitched one when done this way. This is the standard way to produce a dummy comp.You also will have to trim the pages to align after "page creep" forces the centre pages to protrude more than the outside pages of the booklet.8 pages (self covered) will be the maximum number of pages for folios made this way. It is the maximum conventional folio size.
Removing ink/toner from smudges on thick paper
A normal white plastic eraser should do the trick. As you pointed out, the ink is already smudging so any reasonable effort to remove it will work. Make sure to keep the eraser clean to avoid working the toner into the paper surface.Another possibility would be to apply a thin layer of paper (rubber) cement over the smudges. After it dries, use a natural rubber pick-up square (sometimes called a mouse) to remove the cement and smudges. It contains no water so it will not distort the paper. It dries quickly.Note: Do not use "one-coat" cement which will be more difficult to remove if not impossible. I use "Best-Test" brand paper cement. A small bottle comes with its own brush applicator.A third possibility would be to use a very sharp knife such as a single-edge razor blade or x-acto knife (with #10 General Purpose blade which is curved to avoid gouging or cutting the surface). Use the appropriate blade nearly perpendicular to the surface to gently scrape the toner off the paper. Pull the blade toward you lightly and repeatedly until the mark is gone. This is a make-shift knife eraser that is used on parchment and other such surfaces. When done properly, there is little or no trace of the mark on the piece.Note that the knife eraser needs a bit of attention when used on folds, creases, or scores that make the surface uneven. 
How can I get the smell of garlic off my hands?
my answer to getting rid of garlic smell on hands is to get lemon and salt and mix them together and rub it into your hands and you'll notice that the garlic smell has gone.
Killing flies with your bare hands
If you are happy to squish them, this is my technique. I move my arm very slowly. Flies perceive human movements as slow in comparison to our own perception, so I tend to move at a glacial pace, so the fly does not detect my movements. Once I am close enough I wait until the fly is cleaning its legs or eyes before I strike. If the fly stops cleaning it is either aware of me (or another external influence) or it is ready to move off. Whilst the fly is cleaning I try and overreach, so if the fly is facing away from me, I will swat a few inches ahead of it in anticipation of it moving off, trying to make the move as rapid as possible. It doesn't always work, but I've killed some this way. 
How can I get the smell of garlic off my hands?
Blimey, what a performance all these solutions are.  All you need is one of these - stainless steel soapshttps://www.amazon.co.uk/blomus-63113-stainless-steel-soap/dp/B00008W6A5I've had one for years, works a treat, but you can use any stainless steel implement that can easily be manipulated, a spoon or ladle or whatever, under running water, with ordinary soap, though it works just as well without ordinary soap. The deleted response by User 6976 will also work, provided you have a stainless steel sink, but its easier with a stainless steel bar. Works for fish smells too.
deter badgers from garden
Buy a bottle of Jeyes Fluid, soak old rags or cloths in it, drape or fix the rags near the entry points you think they're using - they hate the smell, classic gardener's solution to the problem. You will need to refresh the cloths occasionally with the Fluid.
Transport a washing machine over stairs alone
For flat surfaces, using the hand truck to move this is fairly easy.For the stairs, there is a strategy; however, to determine feasibility, it depends how strong you are, and the type of stairs you will traverse, and the amount of time you will have. For a wide, flat staircase, with regular landings every few meters,  it might be possible to slide the machine up on a flat pieces of wood. Place wood slates like a 2x4 flat on the stair, tip the side of the washing machine onto the wood, then push it up to the landing. Make sure the machine doesn't push you back down the stairs; serious injury would be the result.For a spiral staircase, this won't work. A decent option in this case is to identify what is the heaviest part of the machine, and remove is and carry it separately. For an old washing machine,perhaps just removing the motor will make it possible for you to carry it up in parts.I personally would hire someone though.
Killing flies with your bare hands
This probably isn't a complete duplicate,  since you're looking for a way to kill flies with your bare hands. Anyways, try this approach I answered on another question about removing flies. 
Killing flies with your bare hands
I would suggest you a method:If you are totally fed up with a lot of them, try immersing your finger in sugar solution. Keep it open and thus trap most of them. Squeeze them up if you do not mind doing that. They will get stuck to your hands as sugar act some sort of glue here.If you have a small number, wash your hands. Find them, kill them by clapping your wet hands. Wet hands will not allow them to escape.
Using a floor fan and AC units in circus to cool a room
REVIEW: It is important to isolate the air conditioner air flow. Air conditioners work by producing heat as part of the "cooling" process. Hot air is pushed out of one side and cool air from the other. Keep the hot part out of your area as much as possible. Often, the hot air tubes become radiant heaters, themselves. Keep them as short as possible and insulate them if possible.The doors into the room appear to be close together. If the doors open into a hallway or into a common room, that area will become a larger room to cool, in effect.If the adjacent room is cooler than yours, the fan alone in the doorway will equalize the temperature by recirculating and mixing the air with both doors open. If not close the door to reduce the load on your air conditioner.The Fan: Once you have isolated yourself in your environment, position the fan to create optimal air circulation within the room by having all the air moving in the same direction. Try putting it against the centre of a wall so that air is pushed around the room in as smooth a circular pattern as possible.
Using a floor fan and AC units in circus to cool a room
The fan is irrelevant to the actual cooling, all it will do is redistribute air.Put it where it will blow across you - you will perceive the air-flow as cooling, because of the evaporative effect & also it will move the small layer of body-heated air away from you.The most important thing is to seal the room as best you can.Close the second door completely.Insulate the hot air output & the door it goes through with towels or bedding, to make a barrier between the temperature differential of outside the room & inside.Two things you cannot do with air-con...1) cool the entire world - any gap open to the outside will negate the cooling effect & the drying effect. If the air-con struggles to get the temperature down as far as you'd like it, the humidity-reduction effect alone would be better than the outdoors.2) cool any space that includes both the input & output - the net effect would be to heat the space. You must isolate the heated output completely from the cooled area.
How to clean my hair without being able to wash it?
Wear a hat. Seriously, if you can't get it wet, you don't want potentially irritating dry chemicals on it either.
How to clean my hair without being able to wash it?
The most effective "dry shampoo" I know of is corn starch.  It works by binding to skin oil on the hair shafts, but not bonding to the hairs or skin (as long as they're dry).  Spread a couple tablespoons of starch evenly through your hair, working it well in with your fingers (almost as if shampooing), then comb/blow the starch out.It's no substitute for actually washing, but it'll be a lot better than completely letting your hair go for three weeks.
How to clean my hair without being able to wash it?
Homemade Dry Shampoo RecipeThere are many different substances that you can use as the base of dry shampoo. Ground-up oatmeal, arrowroot powder, and a variety of other fine, absorptive powders can be used. Organic cornstarch is easy to find and it’s something that I always have around the house anyway. Cornstarch absorbs oil, well.Ingredients½ cup organic cornstarchOptional Additions3-4 drops essential oil (for the scent)2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder (for people with darker hair)2 Tbsp cinnamon (for people with red or auburn hair)DirectionsCombine all ingredients well and store your all-natural, homemade dry shampoo in the container of your choice. Some good options are a Mason™ jar with holes poked in the lid, a large un-used salt shaker, or a recycled parmesan cheese container. Mason™ jars can be found in supermarkets, hardware stores, and places where canning supplies are sold. Other brands are Ball, Bernadin, Crown, and others.ApplicationDry shampoo is always applied at the roots of the hair. Use a brush or a comb and separate sections of your hair, shaking the powder onto your scalp. Massage it into the surrounding hair and let it sit for approximately two minutes–just enough time to absorb all that oil! When you’re finished, brush the dry shampoo through your hair until it is no longer visible.ResultsIt mostly involves giving up on straight hair forever and embracing your natural curls, but dry shampoo helps a little bit. It can’t replace a regular hair-washing routine, but it does help get an extra day or two when you need it.For something that’s simple and inexpensive to make, all-natural dry shampoo is very effective!Source of article excerpt at DIYNatural.comDisclaimer: check with your medical practitioner regarding suitability of materials and processes given here.
How can I "wear in" my shoes without wearing them?
I was told this hack. I have heard it more than once from different sources; but, I have never tried it myself. To stretch (break-in) new leather shoes so that they are comfortable to wear, carefully line each shoe with plastic such as a thick sheet of plastic or use a heavy gauge plastic freezer bag.Push the plastic into each shoe as far and as completely as you can. Lace up and tie the shoe laces securely.Fill each plastic lined shoe with water up to the brim and freeze it SOLID in a freezer. The ice inside the bag in the shoe will take the shape of the shoe. The water will freeze, swell, and stretch the leather proportionately as it increases size. When the water has frozen solid, the process is finished and the bag, and ice can be removed.The shoes should fit perfectly. If more stretching is wanted, repeat the process.
How to remove the bhoosa [chaff] from the phool jhadu [grass broom]?
Basically broom grass crop gets ready to reap in January. If the farmer cut it late, say after 15 February of every year, then seeds starts coming on it which become quite fat in March-April crop.Broom manufacturers use March-April material while manufacturing broom because the price of that broom grass is quite less then January grass.Only a few reputed brands like Tiger Brand, Vip jharu delhi, Broomsindia etc use best grass from which you don't have to clean broom / broom bhoosa (chaff).So go for quality instead of dipping broom in water or keeping it in front of fan, and don't apply your comb on it.

How to get sock marks off legs quickly
Try socks made for diabetic patients.I got a pair and I love them because they are comfortable, have no rubber elastic or other constricting stretchy stuff in them. I found them at local drug stores, in the pharmacy section of super markets, and super store chains. They must be available online, too. They are inexpensive enough to try a pair.They come in different colours and kinds from thick sports socks, socklets, and men's dress calf-length. None need garters to stay up.They won't leave marks as the normal ones do. I think you'll be satisfied.Ideally, you could get socks that were sized for your feet and your calf size separately. Unfortunately mass produced sock size templates do not accommodate all the different variations of human bodies.
How to clean my hair without being able to wash it?
You don't really need to buy or make dry shampoo - I just use a nicely scented talcum powder, sprinkle it on my hands and run my hands through my hair, or apply it lightly with a powder puff, wait a few minutes, then brush it through so it doesn't look grey. But, if you're going to use anything as a dry shampoo, you have to be sure not to get any of it in the wound... It helps to dry up grease and freshens the hair, but whether you can get away with doing that for two weeks without giving in and washing it, I'm not sure.
Is there a way to make myself sleep quickly without resorting to sleeping pills or any sleeping foods?
Try the 'cognitive shuffle'. I recently read about it in Oliver Burkeman's column:Essentially, you just visualise random objects. This tricks your brain into thinking it's done for the day with nothing important going on. I have found it effective.
Is there a way to make myself sleep quickly without resorting to sleeping pills or any sleeping foods?
Proven aids to falling asleep faster:Sleep alone; a bed partner will disturb with movements, snoring, talking, and may distract with other bedroom activities.Avoid backlit or self-lit displays (computer, cell phone/tablet, TV, etc.) for an hour before bedtime.Eliminate caffeine (coffee, tea, sodas) for at least the last six hours before bedtime; preferably, completely quit using caffeine.Don't smoke immediately before bed (and especially don't smoke in bed; this is a serious hazard of dying in a fire if you should fall asleep with a lit cigarette in hand or mouth).Make the bedroom as dark as is practical.Use a noise generator or recording of surf, rain, or forest sounds (whatever you find restful) to cover outside sound (traffic, others in the house, etc.).Go to bed at the same time every night -- weeknights and weekends -- and get up the same time every day, even if you're not fully rested (this resets your daily rhythm to the schedule you need for workdays; sleeping in on the weekend disrupts that rhythm).  Allow at least seven hours, preferably eight, for sleep -- from light out (if you read or do other things in bed) until your alarm time.Note that experts say that if you take less than twenty minutes to fall asleep in a dark room without distractions, you are probably sleep deprived; don't put too much emphasis on trying to get to sleep in ten minutes.  On the other hand, if you're doing all these things and still can't get to sleep in under an hour, and still exhibit symptoms of sleep deprivation (tendency to fall asleep during the day without constant stimulus is high on the list), you should get your doctor to refer you to a sleep specialist; you may have a sleep disorder (insomnia, sleep apnea, or something less common).None of this is really a "life hack", it's all just good practice everyone in our habitually sleep-deprived society should follow (though many/most of us can dispense with some of these if they aren't causing trouble).
How to dry out a wet backpack
Can Prevention of the soaking wet backpack be a viable answer? Is that a hack?There must be rain covers or some means to deal with this common situation and a waterproof backpack is too obvious for a hack.I have seen plastic storage (garbage?) bags that could cover your backpack to repel the water before it strikes your backpack. Although simplistic, this should minimize the amount of water to evaporate.Putting the bag over the pack will let you carry on hiking, biking, etc. in a downpour without getting a drop on or in your pack.Another possibility is to carry a poncho in the bottom of you bag to put over you and your pack in the event of rain to keep you both dry and your hands free. It takes up practically no space and is a practical hack (okay, workaround) for your "problem"
Is there method to protect coffee from moisture
Due to supply problems importing, roasting, and blending forces me to order and buy a minimum amount of my favourite coffee at a time. It will last me more than a month.I asked the supplier how best to store my investment.The supplier suggested I keep/store the unground beans at room temperature in the original corrugated-plastic lined paper bags with a roll-down cuff and metal "closure" seal. Grind as much as you need and roll the cuff to keep air in the package to a minimum for the remainder. If you do refrigerate the beans, let them come to room temperature before grinding to enjoy the full flavour and bouquet from the brew.I keep unopened bags of coffee in a small carton on the bottom shelf of a cupboard in the kitchen. I've been doing this for years.I did notice that when I first get the batch of beans from the coffee roasters they're oily and very shiny. As time passes, the gloss slowly disappears and near the end of the batch the beans have a matte finish as the oil gets absorbed into the body of the bean.

How to protect coffee machine from others in a public space?
There is a type of plug/socket combination known as a Walsall Plug, which looks similar to a standard 13A UK plug, but the pins go the other way [90° from standard]...Left, Standard right Walsall...You replace the regular plug on the coffee machine with a Walsall, then make a short extension cable from 'standard plug [any nationality] to a Walsall socket' -  then only the holder of the extension 'key' could make coffee.If you made inline mains extenders plug to socket, for either all group members, or just one as a 'loaner' to be returned to the 'holder of the key' then no-one else could even plug it in.The Walsall would function on any international standard mains system, with or without earth [ground] as your 'lock & key' contains both elements.The same system could be made from any non-standard connector, from as esoteric as the Mains Power XLR [Power Canon]......to "any plug/socket not readily available in your territory"You're not really trying to keep out the 'serious hacker' who would investigate how to get his own 'key' made, just casual "ooohhhhh, free coffee" wannabes ;-)

Drug dealers have been putting pot into coffee beans for a while and you could do the same. Nest the double bagged pot inside a larger bag of black-roasted coffee beans.After a couple of hours, it will begin to leak. For more insulation, put the whole package into a thermos jug. It will be good for a while longer.These will mask an odour NOT prevent the allergen from making your outwardly grateful passengers, inwardly uncomfortable victims of exposure.What do you intend to do about your car interior, clothes, and breath in the automobile after you smoke enroute?
How to store bananas and keep fruit flies away?
Flair's contention that [putting bananas] in the fridge [...] causes them to ripen quickly is false, though a common misconception. Actually, refrigerating bananas cause their peels (aka skins--the terms are apparently interchangeable) to blacken (as explained here), but the fruit itself keeps quite well (as explained here). Unless you plan on eating (or displaying :-) banana peels, banana fruit ripens more slowly when refrigerated. So if you're only eating the fruit, do what I do:allow unpeeled bananas to ripen at room temperature.once ripened, refrigerate unpeeled bananas for up to 5 days.if necessary to store ripe bananas for periods > 5 days: peel, cut, and freeze.That being said, note also that banana peels/skins are edible! though they require quite a bit of preparation. Banana-peel cake is apparently popular in Brazil; some English-language recipes are here and here.

Marijuana Smell Blocking During Local Travel
Easy! Put it in a thoroughly cleaned jar. If you have a full 1/2 (14grams), you should be able to put this in the smallest sized mason jar. This is also great for general storage of legal /medical marijuana, as it is airtight; completely "smell proof"; and will not allow your flowers to dry out - in fact it will continue the curing process. If you don't want to buy mason jars, any glass food jar or any airtight container that is glass will work. Just make sure that if you're using something that once contained food, that after cleaning the jar you remove any rubber on the interior of the cap ( some have this some don't); the rubber will retain the food smell despite washing. For smaller amounts, empty  prescription medicine bottles with the label removed work excellent for this purpose.

How to make milk (cardboard container) ice cold fast?
Milk box acts as an insulator.Keep an empty glas decanter in your fridge. Pour milk in decanter and put it back in frigde.Large surface of cool decanter will quicker cool milk. Even a bit quicker, if a larger surface of a flat bowl is used.Train your habbits. When dumping a milk cardboard always put a new milk back in fridge.

How to tackle with mosquitoes in my room?
There is no permanent solution to keeping mosquitoes out of a house, other than effective window screens. Many people are trying to find ways to prevent mosquitoes from breeding or to prevent them from carrying diseases such as malaria, dengue and zika.You might best work on two areas:Eliminate breeding places nearby, such as empty tires, open plastic pots and uncovered rain barrels. Mosquitoes do not fly long distances, so you can make a difference by working in your neighborhood.Put up window screens and bed nets. Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) "are highly effective in reducing childhood mortality and morbidity from malaria."
How to make milk (cardboard container) ice cold fast?
If speed is your main criteria, the various life hacks to cool water fast will also work well for milk. See our Quickly Cool a Bottle of Water thread.The fastest (and most practical) technique I found is wrapping a bottle [of milk] in a wet paper towel and putting it in the freezer. For an average half-liter-sized bottle, you will have deeply chilled milk in about 20-30 minutes. You can also use this technique with your original cardboard container, but cardboard does not transfer the heat as well, and it will simply take longer to cool a container with a larger volume. 
How to dry out a wet backpack
If the purpose of drying the backpack is to keep the contents inside dry then just grab a plastic bag and put the plastic bag inside of the backpack and the contents that are supposed to stay dry inside the plastic bag.

How to make milk (cardboard container) ice cold fast?
This technique will work for a single serving of milk, not for an entire carton.First, get an empty ice cube tray.  A metal one is preferable, but plastic will do. (It's even better if the tray has been in the freezer for a while already, but that might be too much to ask.)Pour the warm milk into the tray.  Spreading it out this way, rather than keeping it in a carton or bottle, will increase its surface area.  Increased surface area will speeds up the cooling process.Put the milk-filled ice-cube tray in the freezer. You can also lower the temperature of your freezer, temporarily.  And you could put something already frozen and flat (like a packaged frozen dinner) on top of the ice cube tray to assist with the temperature transfer.I haven't tested this, but I imagine the milk will become cold within 10-15 minutes.When it's cold enough for you, you may want to carefully pour the milk into a large mixing bowl or cake pan, and then pour it into your cereal bowl or glass, to prevent spillage.
How can I unclog my headphone port on my phone?
You can pull soft materials out of a narrow space using a screw.First, check the size of your phone's audio jack (it is likely 3.5 mm), then pick up a wood screw that is about 0.5 - 1.0 mm narrower than that space.  Power down your phone completely. Then, holding the screw between your thumb and index finger, gently "thread" the screw between your fingers, moving the screw into the space of the audio jack. Be mindful so not to push too hard against the back end of the audio jack component, or to unnecessarily scrape up the metal contacts inside. When it feels like you are far enough to be into some foreign material, gently pull the screw straight out, trying to draw out any foreign obstructions caught up in the treads. Repeat as necessary until no more foreign material is removed. This should clear out any excessive obstructions lodged in the audio jack space. 
How can I unclog my headphone port on my phone?
Drop into a drug store and in the toothbrush section look for a proxabrush which is long tiny VERY rugged and with flexible bristles that are stiff but not hard. Use the brush in the same manner as directed for the woodscrew (insert, twist, withdraw, remove stuff, repeat) but with no fear of damaging any delicate parts in the phone jack.The short bristles that stick out at 90° are arranged in spirals that are great for snagging lint fibres, threads, and "stuff." There's no metal-to-metal contact so there's no need to power down, or remove batteries, etc.They come in different lengths, shapes (cone, straight), thicknesses, and widths. I use them for cleaning and applying lubricant to tiny things.All my needs have been met with a few sales samples. The handles are colour coded to tell one size and shape from another.
How can I unclog my headphone port on my phone?
Use a vacuum cleaner with a small nozzle attachment. Apply the suction directly over the hole for the headphone jack to remove loose debris. As an added bonus, this will get some heavier materials that may have migrated down the hole.Once you have successfully removed the foreign materials, purchase a simple plastic plug for the jack to keep it clean. They even come in fun designs.

Way to carry a wedding band on your person when it's not on your finger
After much tinkering, here is the best solution I could come up with.Notably:- there is no "hardware" to fiddle with, break or pull your hair- no dexterity required, I can shift my ring to this while running- cheap, low profile, wearable in shower/swimming, sweat-proof  Buy some 1mm (or 1.5mm, whatever you prefer) cotton, waxed necklace cord. Make a loop which, when doubled, can be comfortably negotiated over your head. Wear the plain, doubled loop. When you need to remove and carry your ring(s): Open the loop, pass a bight through the ring, and put your head through both bights...Getting the length of the necklace just right requires some fiddling. Start with a long piece of string and tie just one of the two fisherman's knots. That way you have a very easily adjustable loop. Wear it both ways and find just the right length that the double-loop-no-ring fits easily over your head, but the double-loop-with-ring won't (for example) slip off your head in a handstand, swimming, whatever you're going to be doing.

How to make milk (cardboard container) ice cold fast?
freeze some milk in a form so you can crush it easily, when you need cold milk, get the frozen milk and crush it (more surface aria) then put the crushed frozen milk into a funnel with a coffee filter in it (the filter is to stop you getting chips of milk in your cereal) and then pour the milk through the funnel. Don't forget to put more milk in the freezer for next time.This could also be done with frozen water but that could effect the taste of the milk. You will have to experiment with how much frozen milk to non frozen is neededone possible way of freezing the milk so you can crush it is by putting it in freezer bags and laying them down so that it forms a thin sheet when frozen.another idea is freeze a half full bottle of milk on its side or better diagonally if you can so there is the largest surface of milk open to the air. when you need to chill room temp milk, pour exactly the right amount of milk into the bottle. swirl and shake it (not too much as you will mix air into the milk and you will get too much milk) then pour it out slowly, frozen side down. Then put it back in the freezeri don't how long milk is still fresh when frozen so you may need to occasionally replace the frozen milk. I say only put the milk you want to use in the "chilling bottle" as mixing milk from different containers can reduce the life of the milk plus you would have to then either freeze the remainder milk or use the rest of the unfrozen milk before the frozen defrosts otherwise you will have to replace it. this will work for 2% or less, i dont know at what percentage of fat milk can no longer be frozen in a domestic freezer.

I can't stop sneezing
As already mentioned, looking toward bright light can induce sneezing. This is known as photic sneeze reflex (PSR), "estimated to occur in 18 to 35 percent of the population".You could also lightly stimulate the nerves by sticking something with a narrow point up your nose (e.g. pen cap). I wouldn't recommend it, though. Yes, it will cause you to sneeze, but it can — and frequently does — cause an infection itself (even when you don't have one to begin with).To stop the tickling sensation, apply pressure to each side of your nose with two fingers, right where the bridge (i.e. nasal bone) ends.

Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
A rubber band.  I was a paper boy and always had paper rubber bands.  Break the loop.  Strike from about 8 inches away when they land.   At school I would wait for them to land on my desk and get them every time.   
I can't stop sneezing
The easiest method is to put a small piece of cotton in each nostril. That will not stop the breathing but will block the movement of the things that are causing sneezing. 
Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?
Use a hoover without the filter bag.Turn on the hoover and point to the fly. The vacuum will pull it in, and the fly will die when passing through the internal fan.Too cruel (and noisy) though. >=/
How to reduce eye strain caused by constant exposure to computer screen?
Not much you need to do actually, you are just overloading your eyes because of much time focused in your mind, therefore starring for long times at your screen.Remember to do some slow blinks (close eyes for 1 second) the most often you can, or close your eyes when things are processing/compiling/etc. Take breaks to look at stuff far from you (outside of the window or in a distant point in the room). Switching focus is kind of a workout for the eyes. And wash your eyes with cold water every hour if you can.
How to make thin hair look thicker?
I have started to use wash&go, shampoo and conditioner in one, in the shower. It saves a lot of time in the shower, its very cheap and doesn't hold my hair down! Once my hair is dry its got so much volume that it lasts for days. For a little bit extra smoothness I use hair oil or coconut oil on it while its still damp. Salt spray also helps with volume. 
How to eliminate static-y hair?
You should try hair oil.Seal the Moisture  If your hair is of medium density or a wavy texture, an oil based leave-in conditioner is a better option. Apply an even coat after towel drying. This helps to seal moisture into your hair before the dry air around you has a chance to rob moisture away. Again, you don’t need a market bought conditioner. Jojoba oil, or coconut oil, or peach kernel oil or shea butter will make a wonderful leave-in conditioner. Rub a small amount into your palms then spread it through your hair. It will give you a great boost of sheen and volume and prevent further flyaway. Obviously, use sparingly and keep away from your roots and fringe.   http://www.hairbuddha.net/prevent-static-hair/
How to protect the lace holes of a shoe from the lace without an eyelet?
When you pull it the laces tight, pull them straight out from the hole (i.e. outwards from the shoe) as opposed to upwards (or 90 degrees from the hole).This will help limit the friction applied to the holes from the laces and hence help prevent rippage.
Replacing lost power adapter using low-cost alternative
There are a number of "universal" adapters costing far less than the OEM replacement. There are a few factors to check to match the original:Output voltage should be within 5% off of the OEM supply. Check the input voltage on the device, if you can't find the output of the supply. Output connector must match that of your device. Be sure of the polarity, as well (often center positive, shell negative, but not always.) Try a universal power supply (PS) with multiple connectors, unless you can find a PS that is designed to match your device.Mains voltage and connectors should match your region, e.g. 230V in G.B. or 120V in U.S.A). Some newer "wall warts" may work from 110V to 240V.The PS must be able to supply at least the rated current of the original, but can be higher.Buy from a reputable source... there are rare cases of poor electrical isolation between mains and device, which is shocking!
How to protect the lace holes of a shoe from the lace without an eyelet?
You could reinforce the rim of the hole, inside and out, with Shoe Goop or even clear nail polish (though not as effective).BTW, some grommets have sharp edges, which tear laces.
How to protect the lace holes of a shoe from the lace without an eyelet?
How to lace shoes for proper fit. (a technique to use for the eyelet style)Proper shoe lacing prevents unnecessary stress on the eyelets (the small holes for the lace) and the counters (backs of the shoes). Here are a number of ways to lace shoes.https://www.aofas.org/.../Lacing-Techniques-for-Proper-Shoe-Fit.aspxDress shoes often have leather to lace unreinforced eyelet treatment. There are a number of ways to make attractive lacing patterns here.http://www.ties.com/how-to-tie-dress-shoesYou can also buy aftermarket self-backing reinforced eyelets to install yourself. While the link takes you to a source that might be more than you want to order, it is a possibility. A shoe repair station may give or sell you a lesser amount for your pair. Get a few extras for other eyelets, too. This is increasing the cost of the pair you already bought. You can blame the manufacturers for passing the cost on to you after the sale. Avoid one-piece "grommets" which are weak and split easily. Ask for two-piece ones that are made well and don't tear the shoe or the lace.http://www.shoe-eyelets.com/index.htmlFirst and foremost, avoid round hard laces that don't distribute the stress evenly. Substitute and use a flat soft fabric lace.The maximum tension is exerted at the eyelets where you pull. If the lace across the toe is too loose, pulling the laces hard at the top exerts minimal force to the lace tension at the toe.After the laces appear the way you find most attractive, begin to tighten them by taking up the slack length starting with the toe and working your way up from there.When pulling shoelaces tight, pull outwards rather than upwards, to lessen friction against the holes.Pull firmly and evenly and don't tug quickly on the lace ends.Tie the lace with an Ian Knot which uses fewer steps than a regular knot.
How do you stop headphone wires from breaking?
Use zip-ties across a loop at each end to prevent tugging. These cables fail because of tugging and bad rubber on the wires. The bad rubber will now not tear, and tugging at the weakest spot is not going to happen. Looks silly though. I do this with AC wiring after I've used heatshrink tube to the solder joints... Just works.

How do I bend cheese?
Your friend was teasing you. Not all cheeses can be folded. You will probably have the greatest success with "KRAFT™" process cheese due to its plastic consistency. (Maybe that stuff IS plastic.) Fermented or natural brick cheeses like cheddar are too dry or flakey to slice thin enough to fold. Some foldable cheese needs to be put on a sheet of parchment paper before it is folded. Then, by folding the parchment you avoid the break. You cannot get a sharp crease with cheese, as it will break when you push down on the fold. At best, all you can expect is a loose round fold. After you fold the cheese a first time, there is no way to fold it again unless you put butter, margarine, or some lubricant to allow the cheese layers to slide upon each other as it is folded or it will break. Warming the cheese will help somewhat. Yellow process cheese folds more easily than the white. Swiss process cheese is the bendyest(?) of all. When you get more practice, cheese origami is a demanding artform practiced by very few. (I am kidding about the origami with cheese; but, who knows?)

After you finish your yogurt (or pint of ice cream), cut the plastic container vertically into a medium-wide strip and trim off the bottom. Bend the strip lengthwise to fit into the heel of the shoe.A dollar-bill sized strip of polypropylene (PP) will lay flat on a closet shelf patiently waiting for your next application. It will fit into your hip pocket, wallet, or bag. It works wet or dry, and can be used for other things that a bobby pin can't.

Refreshing and preserving crackers
After I open them, I put my crackers and chips in the freezer. They stay fresh much longer there; weeks if not months.
Keeping quiet in the kitchen at night while other people sleeping
I've been in a house where all the rooms have an automatically regulated AC unit with a strong exhaust that generates a lot of ambient noise. On the base floor, there's a kitchen and a common room and metal stairs leading to the sleeping rooms above. When the AC unit in my room is off, I can hear the loud booming noises from the stairs, people opening and closing doors to their rooms, banging cupboards in the kitchen, even using the toilet or taking showers in the adjacent rooms.Yet, when the AC unit is on, all the sounds are drowned. This might seem like a general recommendation and may not be feasible to pull off, but perhaps installing speakers into rooms and slowly introducing ambient noise before you arrive might help everyone out.
Keeping quiet in the kitchen at night while other people sleeping
You have indicated the action that should be taken which is to isolate the kitchen (sources of noise) from the rest of the household or vise-versa. Kitchen doors are problematic and are rarely used for various reasons.The refrigerator door is a relatively easy fix. Clean the gasket seal around the refrigerator door and where it presses against the metal frame. A sticky seal will need more force to open which will rattle all the containers in the door. They tend to be small glass containers that bang into each other.From your post, you have some experience with roommates. If you think that you are doing as much as you can, your roommates will have to take ownership and responsibility for themselves by doing what they can to ensure their well-being. This includes closing their bedroom door. If the bedrooms don't have a door, this is a problem with a very workable solution.Investigate the possibilities of installing an acoustical folding door which is a Do-it-yourself kit. It's an expense and someone will have to buy it and install it which is an issue for the landlord. Happily, it's a tax-deductible expense in most jurisdictions and one which will make tenant's life a bit more bearable there.http://www.accordion-door.com/2100.htmlGood luck.
Refreshing and preserving crackers
If you have a toaster oven, you can lay them on a metal tray or a sheet of aluminum foil, and toast them for 1-2 minutes. Only toast the ones you're planning to eat right then.I've done this with older corn chips. I assume it will work just as well with crackers!

What is the best way to master keyboard: Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic?
I've used the older Ergonomic keyboard occasionally (a partner had one).  I found it worked fine with the standard home key finger placement (asdf jkl; on an English QWERTY keyboard).  My reaches and strokes were the same as what I learned (on manual and Selectric typewriters) in 1975, though it took a little practice to get comfortable with the hand positions after twenty-some years on flat computer keyboards.If you need to learn touch typing, follow the standard methods; the keys are in standard QWERTY order, including the upper row number/symbol keys, enter, backspace, tab, and cap lock, unless you've loaded a Dvorak or other alternate layout in software.  If you're not working in English on your computer, hopefully you were able to get the Sculpt Ergonomic in your own language character set, and if so, it should support the same home keys and technique as a standard keyboard for your language.
Refreshing and preserving crackers
There are commercial cracker storage containers made out of heavier polyethylene, or of polypropylene (which is dish-washer safe). The problem with thinner polyethylene plastic bags is that there is some permeability to water vapor.You can improve upon these by putting in a packet of silica gel water absorbent; the silica can be regenerated by gentle heating in an oven.You might also try reusing the aluminum-foil lined zipper-locking plastic bags from large coffee packages. The aluminum layer is particularly impermeable to air and water vapor! Note that these bags often have a one-way valve to allow removing air. This may be an asset or hindrance -- if the crackers don't stay crisp, try taping over the valve.

How to avoid ruining the collar on men's dress shirt?
You can use some Spray 'n Wash around the inside of the collar before each wash. I've been doing it for a while now and it usually does a pretty good job of preventing stains.  Since I wear an undershirt beneath most dress shirts I usually only wash them every other time anyway and as long as I use a relatively delicate wash I don't notice much (if any) fading.  Of course this goes without saying that you should still be showering regularly. You'll want to remove as much dead skin/oil/dirt as possible before you're wearing these shirts.
How to avoid ruining the collar on men's dress shirt?
Tthere's nothing to gain by using a special product on the ring.  All that ring is, is dead skin cells rubbed off your neck, made visible mainly by the presence of your skin pigments (the darker your skin, the more visible the ring), and soap sellers have been trying to give us solutions for it for at least the past fifty years.First, be aware that the ring isn't visible to anyone else while you're wearing the shirt -- especially if your collar is buttoned and you're wearing a tie.There still isn't a better way to clean the ring than just putting a portion of your regular amount of liquid detergent (measure your detergent, then use some from the cup for this, rather than using more from the bottle or jug) directly on the inside of the collar at your regular laundering, and rubbing it vigorously into the fabric.  If you use a powder detergent, take a little of what you'd normally use on a damp toothbrush and brush it thoroughly into the ring.Neither of these techniques is perfect; over time the ring will build up, unavoidably; this is part of "wearing out" fine clothing.  Eventually, they're fit only for casual wear, and a little after that, they're off to the charity store -- unless you're like me, and wear them (casually) until they fall apart.  Take comfort in the fact that, if you have a few of these good shirts, and wash them only when they actually need it (food stains, soils, or too much of your own scent), they'll last long enough to go out of fashion before they're too worn for formal wear.
How to prevent clothes from shrinking in the washing machine
The tags on your clothing give instructions on how to wash them. Here is a helpful reference image.
How to avoid ruining the collar on men's dress shirt?
I found nothing about the frequency of washing.I did find this:You can't simply add products like Oxi to your washing and expect miracles. OxiClean (Borax, Amaze, and Arm & Hammer Washing Soda) are laundry boosters, which means that they'll help to brighten-up average laundry. Boosters can also be used as stain removers, but they have to be applied directly to the problem area and allowed some time to work. (This is true of all stains, not just a shirt collar.)CAUSE: Most people agree some collar (and the cuffs of shirts) staining is due to sweat, which is true, but only partially so. Collar darkening is caused by a combination of sweat, dead skin cells, skin oils, and soap product buildup. Sweat can't be helped, but if the collar is a persistent problem for you, try to pay a little extra attention to your neck right at the end of your shower. Doing so will help to remove dead skin, as well as any residue shampoo, conditioner and/or soap you may have left behind. If you use hair products, you may also want to give your neck a quick wiping off after you've done your hair but before you put on your shirt.TREATMENT: Directly apply your preferred laundry washing product to the problem area, but be ready for the possibility that it might not work as well as you want. DO NOT give up if that happens. Try a different product. This is sort of a frustrating thing to have to say, but unfortunately the truth is what works on one person's stained shirt may not work on another person's stained shirt. There are a lot of different possible combinations. One shirt was saved with OxiClean's spray stain treatment on the collar and then rubbing the collar against itself before washing so that the fabric absorbs the detergent. Another person tried the same thing and pfft. Nothing. A different kind of product he tried did work.PRODUCTS:Sprays: Spray stain treatments are probably the easiest of the bunch to apply. Just spritz spritz spritz, and then work the product into the stained area by rubbing the shirt's material against itself. You can also use an old toothbrush or a laundry brush to help work the product in. In the spray category, some brands to look out for are: - OxiClean - Zout - Shout - Resolve/was sold under the name Spray 'n Wash - Charlie’s SoapBars: Using a laundry bar will take a bit more effort than a spray—though really only a bit more. The upside is that the force of rubbing the bar into your stained collar will obviate the need to rub the shirt's fabric against itself. In the laundry bar category, some brands to look out for are: - Fels Naptha - Zote - Dr. Bronner'sGels etc.: Products that you need to spread onto a stain using your hands: - Goop - Mom’s Goop - Liquid laundry detergent - Dish soapGeneral guidelines: When in doubt, reach for the dish soap when you don't know what it is or where it came from.Other kinds of soap will work too—liquid laundry detergent, hand soap, bar soap—but dish soap is one of those things that's almost always on hand and is also my go-to whenever anything gets spilled in my house. Splashed some coffee on the duvet? Dish soap. Dropped a piece of dressed lettuce on your pants? Dish soap. Have a mystery stain? Dish soap.The thing is about dish soap is that it's mild, so the worst thing that will happen is that it doesn't work. Usually, with a small amount of dish soap and a sponge, the problem will disappear.If the worst happens and the dish soap doesn't remove the stain, head for one of your stain pretreatment products. Again, the use of a stain treatment isn't going to hurt the situation, though of course it may not help.Nylon (specifically) can be machine washed using either cold or warm—but not hot—water. It's best to air dry nylon, though it can be dried in the machine using a no-heat cycle. Unfortunately, most nylon items cannot be dry-cleaned because the solvents will melt the fabric, but in the case of mystery stains on clothes that can be dry cleaned, sometimes the best course of action is just to throw a few bucks at the problem and let the professionals figure it out.
How to back up with a trailer?
Practice, practice, practice. Go somewhere it doesn't matter and try it out. In fact, take the whole family and they can all learn. That stops your spouse from standing there and screaming "left, left", which is not helpful.Use the wing mirrors. If you want to go straight back, if you see your trailer in the right-hand mirror, move your right hand down a bit. If you want to see the trailer in the right-hand mirror, move your left hand down a bit. Don't over steer, trailers react very fast.Don't be afraid to get out and check. If you are worried about hitting stuff you can't see, use sticks as markers. If someone wants to help, tell them only to say "stop" or "keep going".

How can I keep a USB mini 2.0 (or other) cable from tearing?
The connection between the wire and the connector is a very high-stress area, so the degree of flex the wire experiences at that point is substantial. Better-quality cables will typically include a rubberized extension along that connection to spread out the load, but if that does not solve your problem, you can make a more substantial reinforcement yourself.You can use heat shrink wrap tubing to build a longer, more-flexible reinforcement. If you want to get really fancy, add a pen spring before you shrink wrap it to make a really strong, flexible connection. If you don't have shrink wrap on hand, you might want to invest in something like this product called Sugru (product search). Sugru is a moldable/shapeable, self-setting material that turns into a strong, flexible, waterproof rubber overnight. It's more expensive than shrink wrap, but you can use it for fixing, modifying, and making many things that are broken or need this type of modification.

I usually wrap in a small amount of electrical tape right away, before it has a chance to rip.
How can I keep a USB mini 2.0 (or other) cable from tearing?
Most of the problems we have with the cables for our electronic devices are due to the wire jacket (covering) shrinking with use and pulling free from the hard plastic injection-moulded plug.The tiny plugs do not allow much space for the cable to be inserted and the minimal amount that the manufacturer uses soon pulls free due to wire flexing and twisting. The exposed unprotected thin wires are a weak point and soon fail.Stop the cable jacket from pulling free of the plug.As soon as possible (when the wire is new), put a tiny drop of Krazy™ glue (Ethyl Cyanoacrylate) where the wire joins the plug. The liquid will flow around and into the thin gap between the insulation and the plug. Let it set and dry undisturbed completely according to instructions. This strong glue will chemically bond the wire jacket to the plug so that it will not pull free. It will also slightly stiffen the bond. Treat both ends of the new wire.Application TIP: Let it bond without moving it for at least 5 minutes. Let it dry completely for optimal cable life.
How to avoid a loud, embarrassing sneeze?
If you're awake when you sneeze, trying to hold your breath or plug your nose before the sneeze comes out makes the sneeze a lot less explosive and therefore quieter. Keeping your mouth closed will likely help as well.
How to avoid a loud, embarrassing sneeze?
This might take some training, as it is counter-intuitive, but it works like magic for me:As soon as you feel the urge to sneeze building up, exhale completely. You might have to try a few times to find out how early in advance you have to start, and how fast or slowly you have to exhale. The idea is to have exhaled completely at the "point of no return", but also that you don't suffer.In the end, if there is not much air inside you to burst out explosively, it will not make a significant noise. Good luck!
How to wake up early without alarm
My dad taught me this a long time ago. It has never failed me. It does sound strange though. As I'm falling asleep I picture a big faced clock showing the time I want to wake up. At the same time I am repeating the time over and over in my head...8am, 8am...wake up at 8am...I use this method quite often because nothing annoys me more, or sets me up for a bad attitude day is the sound of an alarm. Even waking to the radio gets me going! Good luck!!
How to avoid a loud, embarrassing sneeze?
Simple trick which always works is to press right below your nose. In most cases you will completely avoid sneezing. Good luck!
Hacky way to keep micro USB firmly in place?
If you bend a paperclip properly, so that it is just two wires running parallel with a 180* curve in one end, you could make a latch mechanism of sorts that hooks under the keyboard (the closed end with the bend) and the cable goes in from above. The open end then hooks on the cable side of the connector, pulling it towards the keyboard.Hard to explain and not sure if there's anything to hook onto under the keyboard.
How can I keep a USB mini 2.0 (or other) cable from tearing?
Buy a longer cable so your device no longer hangs in the air but can be placed on the ground. Micro-USB cables are not designed as structural, load-bearing elements, don't try to use them that way. 
How to avoid a loud, embarrassing sneeze?
Personally, I hold in every sneeze. I can't say I recommend it, as this article points out: "The risk of a hearing loss injury due to holding a sneeze is low. However, it is not impossible." Wiki's page on sneezing does a good job explaining what happens in a sneeze. Basically, nose hairs send a signal to the brain, which starts a massive response in the upper body's organs to expand and then contract the chest violently. Since this signal is sent through the nerves, there are lots of ways to try to stop the sneeze completely.For example, some ideas from this wikiHow page are rubbing your nose, pinching the bridge of your nose, pinching the tip of your nose, pulling on your ear, etc. These suggestions come from the idea of sending another signal down the nerve and thereby sort of messing with your brain.
How can I organize Micro SD Cards?
I use a color marker (example) to paint colored dots on them. (Started using nail polish). I sort them by the first dot color, keep them in pillbox each slot assigned with a color. And on the pillbox a label with the colors and content of each one. Also a spreadsheet as backup or more detailed content description if needed.
How to Get Rid of Bed Hair Without a Shower
I have had a similar problem; when there is no time for a morning shower, I do a "simulated shower", which consists of:Thoroughly wet the hair all the way through (kitchen sink?)Dry the hair thoroughly with a towelComb it like you normally would after a shower.Some hair types can stop there; mine will stand up as it becomes completely dry, so I add another step:Wear a hat for about 5 minutes.This way, you'll be "stylin' sammy"
How to Get Rid of Bed Hair Without a Shower
First of all I need to say I really laughed with your question and specifically with the nicknames for every case..To the point now. My hairdresser gave me this advice and it works. Put some lemon on your hair. Especially on those parts that are messy. Do not put too much lemon. I put a teaspoon in my hands and then try to fix my hair as I would if I used wax. Then (important!) get a hair dryer at full speed and heat and with it's help put your hair to the desired position. Don't have it too close or for too long. Just a few seconds for the lemon to dry and for the hair to take more shape. Too much time or too close will result in 'Elvis has left the building' type of nicknames.This way your hair will stand as you want and also will not have a wet look. Just watch out not to put any lemon seeds on your hair or else your nickname will be 'head gardener' or something.
Can graphic tablet/laptop combos replace pen and paper?
Having used many graphic tablets over the years, a couple of points at each end of the scale:a cheap, small one can be useful but unless it comes with good software it will frustrate youa good, high quality, large tablet with professional software can absolutely replace pen and paper, and in fact can be much more efficient, as you can skip your photos/scan stepThe technology that used to only be found in the top end standalone Wacom tablets can now be found in many combined tablet computers, including high dpi resolution, OCR, interfacing to graphics packages etc.So I'd suggest yes, if you get a good one, it will do what you need.
How to Get Rid of Bed Hair Without a Shower
Whenever this happens to me, I usually just wet my hair, throw in some shampoo and wash it really quickly. Afterwards I use a towel to dry some of it and leave the home with semi-wet hair and let it dry in the outside air as I walk to work.Works better than anything else that you mentioned, also you get clean hair in a 5 minutes.
How to protect the lace holes of a shoe from the lace without an eyelet?
Apply a couple coats of clear nail polish (cheaper) or silicone seal to raw edges within holes ... after cleaning them to de-oil/dirt. U will have to redo as it wears off of course.
What is the easiest way to get rid of spilled glitter?
You could  get it up by washing it in a washing machine. If it's a fitted carpet than use THE MOST POWERFUL VACCUM YOU CAN FIND!! Also you should be glad it wasn't on concrete floors. That's a MAJOR PAIN IN THE ASS!!!! P.S I know how you feel. It's super annoying to clean the damn glitter!!!!!
How to fix when there is bubble after putting tempered glass and why is this happening?
If the bubble is in the middle of the glass (it's not touching any sides), then it could be a piece of dust.  Sometimes you can see them, sometimes you can't.  What you can do is get a piece of tape (masking tape works best), lift up the corner closest to the bubble, then slide the tape in between the glass and the phone. Press down on it, then lift the corner up again and slide the tape out.  Most of the time, the dust is stuck on the screen protector so try with the sticky side up first.  If it doesn't work, flip the masking tape and try with the sticky side down.  Do not take the screen protector off all the way or you will likely get more dust inside.When you let the corner down, slightly press the protector from the inside and slide your finger towards the outside to slide the air out.  With practice, you should be able to get it nearly perfect. 
How to make milk (cardboard container) ice cold fast?
To get any liquid cold super fast (less then 3 minutes), put 4 to 5 ice cubes in a plastic bag.  Those soft ones that you get from a roll at the grocery store work best but make sure they are made for food if you use other ones.  Then put the milk on a large bowl, put the bag of ice cubes in the milk.  Do not close the bag to let air out, but don't let milk get in the opening of the bag either so hold the opening with your hands.  Move the milk and bag around for a few minutes and you'll have ice cold milk without making it watery!You can hack a bag with cling wrap if you can't find any soft bags safe for food.
How to quickly remove a splinter
I know this contravenes the original question as it does require a purchase, but that aside, I recommend buying a jewelers loupe (about 20x magnification). I am a carpenter (splinters huh!) and my splinter removing skills were revolutionised with this simple and very cheap tool. Splinters almost too small to see with the naked eye become tree trunks embedded in a mass of skin.....It even makes the tip of the sewing needle look like a knitting needle!  
How to catch a loose parakeet without running him down?
I would recommend either waiting until night or find some other way to make the room very dark. Birds usually sleep/rest at night, and since flying without vision is a quick way to crash they usually don't fly then either. It's the reason why falconers put hoods on their birds to calm them. When you need to catch them, you will need to use a flashlight, but don't leave it on but only turn it on to see where you need to move next, then turn it off and then move to that location.
How to make milk (cardboard container) ice cold fast?
My method is similar to the one by BrettFromLA, but I place a coffee mug or water glass into the freezer. When I want a cold drink, I pour the liquid (milk in your case) into that mug and put the main carton in the refrigerator for later. It's amazing how fast a liquid chills when the glass or ceramic cup it is in is at below freezing temperature. For faster results put the milk filled freezing mug back in the freezer for a few minutes. For a larger volume of cold milk, just freeze more cups.An alternative is to get some ice rocks (sometimes called whiskey stones) and freeze them for use in your cup of milk.
How to clean glass without glass cleaner?
You can just simply use warm water, sponge and vinegar.DO NOT USE PAPER!! I've tried it and it is not very smooth and scratches the glass.
How to clean glass without glass cleaner?
Here's the official Lifehacks technique to use when you clean windows to save time and effort. It works with every liquid cleaning solution from technological to ecological. It's not only what you use but how you use it.When cleaning the exterior of the windows, use all the same direction for your strokes.BUTUse a different direction for the strokes for the inside surfaces.For example: use only vertical strokes when cleaning the exterior and only horizontal strokes for the interior surfaces or vice-versa.WHYWhen you're finished and you examine your work, if you do see a smear or a mark—You'll know immediately by the direction of the smear which side of the glass it's on to remove it completely.
How to clean glass without glass cleaner?
Use methylated spirits in place of windex. Spray it on and wipe off in exactly the same way you would use windex.
How to keep my shoes dry and smell-free when I'm living in a tent for 2 months?
The solution is a second set of footwear that is lightweight and inexpensive. Perhaps sandals, or canvas deck shoes. When you arrive at the campsite, change shoes and set your hiking shoes out in the sun to dry and to air out. Wear the lightweight shoes as you set up camp, cook your evening meal, and so on. If it's raining, hang them up under your tarp (rain protection) - believe it or not things do dry a little this way.It should not be moist in the tent. Typically it is a little warmer in the tent than out, and you should have ventilation. Let both sets of shoes spend the night in the tent with you. Your hiking shoes should not get worse over night. In the morning, put on the lightweight ones and first thing you do, find some sun to get the hiking shoes some more drying time while you prepare breakfast, pack up the camp, and such. One of the last things you do as you leave is switch from your lightweight camp shoes to your hiking shoes for the day, putting the lightweight shoes in your bag.Continue each day and your shoes should stay dry and well aired out. The alternative shoes don't need to be hiking shoes, so they don't need to be expensive or heavy at all. Also, your feet will be healthier switching into dry shoes (and even better, dry socks too) twice a day.
How can I remove sticky residue left by a vinyl sticker from the back of my iPad?
If you have access to an automotive garage, you might consider dabbing Brake Fluid into a disposable towel or cotton ball, and wipe a minimal amount of brake fluid onto the adhesive gum. It should dissolve and wipe away with little effort.Be cautious however, as brake fluid will attack plastic, rubber, and painted surfaces, which probably includes clear coat. Ideally try it out on a hidden area to test if it will adversely affect the surface. Since you mention an unpainted aluminum finish it seemed like this may be okay.
Hacky way to keep micro USB firmly in place?
I've used micro USB right-angle extensions to keep the connection secure. It works because a light amount of tension on the USB cord ends up rotating the male end of the plug ever so slightly inside the female end, rather than trying to disconnect. If you pick a sensible direction of 90 degree bend, it may be beneficial. The drawbacks to this hack are that you have to spend some money to see if it works, and if it does work it can result in breaking the port if you tug at it too hard.
How to compensate for sinking / uneven floor in office
It might look silly, but health and comfort are paramount so who cares. Use a balance chair, perhaps the kind that use a balloon ball for posture. Alternatively, if you need back support you could try a large bean bag. You can put a pedestal underneath to adjust it to a comfortable height. In either case a gravitational balance can be achieved just by shifting your position in the chair.
How can I mass produce confetti?
A "guillotine" style paper cutter is likely to be most efficient for this.  It will cut stacks of paper (older, heavier units will cut a dozen sheets or more; even the new ones that are mostly plastic will cut five sheets).  Cut a narrow strip from a stack of sheets, shift over, and cut another.  Cut as many as you can without risking your fingers, then collect the strips you've cut and cut the ends (length similar to width) to make your confetti.You can convert a full stack of sheets to confetti, leaving a handling strip and some tag ends, in a few minutes.  To make liters will take time, but almost certainly less time than anything else other than a crosscut shredder.
How can I mass produce confetti?
Cutting the first few sheets of paper by hand to make confetti will go well until you get into cutting up the thin strips which do not want to cooperate. You will slow down to a crawl.You must automate this process.To produce the confetti yourself, use a cross-cut paper shredder which produces chips/chads instead of strips of paper produced by most others.Place the shredder over a large waste paper basket lined with a garbage bag so that you won't have to empty it often.You can borrow, or rent a shredder if you look around and try the various flea markets and used equipment online listings. Advertise in the listings to make a contact to get the job done.If you can get your paper supplied in rolls, you can feed several ends into the mouth of the shredder at one time and it will be self-feeding. You can use up to 6 rolls of 20 lb/85 gsm paper stock.Paper when "fluffed up" this way will produce up to 50 times the original volume so have plenty of bags handy for the amount you will produce.You can visit a paper shredder company such as Shred-it to generate massive amounts of your supplied paper as well as a do-it-yourself. Bring your own paper as they treat all materials as confidential and cannot supply their customer's waste for you.
How can I mass produce confetti?
Use a kitchen shredder.You can try other types of "shredders" such as a blender or a food processor if the confetti can be various sized chips of paper. Making confetti with food processing equipment is easy but the quality of the product is low.It's worth a try since different equipment produces different results. Your mileage may vary.You cannot process as much paper this way as the container fills quickly and must be emptied often. The process gets messy very quickly. There's more dust produced this way if you're not careful or not paying attention.
How to remove ballpoint-ink on a card?
Unless the cards are extremely rare, your odds are better of replacing the card from a used source (auction sites, game-specific trading sites) than of removing the ink without damaging the card further.FWIW, the sleeves that many collectible card game players use to protect their cards usually have opaque (colored or patterned) back sides, so the marks on the cards will be hidden if you sleeve them.  That's quite sufficent to avoid "marked card" disputes during play.If you're trying to preserve/restore the value of rarer cards (for sale or trade), you may be better off not trying to remove the ball point ink.  Ball point inks are oil based, so they can be removed by non-polar solvents like naphtha -- but the problem is that the printing inks used to create the cards originally are also oil based and will come off or smear with the same solvents.  It's very unlikely you'll be able to chemically remove the ink markings without destroying the printing on the card.  The value is degraded by the marks, no question, but that reduction is surely less than what would result from massive damage to the printed background pattern from using a solvent that will remove ballpoint ink.Mechanical methods all share one common point: they'll leave white where the marks are removed; they'll gain nothing (relative to card value) over leaving the marks as they are.  I'd recommend accepting the fact that a bad decision to write on the cards (likely when you were rather young, right?) has cost you value, and be content with what you can get for marked-up cards.
Cleaning bathroom tiles without chemicals
Vinegar and water (50/50). That or warm soapy water. Mix it up and pour over the tiles. Let it sit for 30 min and then scrub off. Not just mop it off, it will require some scrubbing. That should do the trick.
How does one efficiently clean-up loose hair strands from one's back after washing hair in the shower? Is there a gadget designed to help with this?
A "lint roller" should do the trick. It's like a roll of adhesive tape, only the adhesive is on the outside of the roll.Once you're dry, you can hold the roller by the handle, reach over your shoulder, and roll the adhesive part across your upper and middle back. If you missed any part of your back, you can reach up under your armpit behind you, and roll the adhesive over the lower portion of your back.In my experience, the adhesive doesn't bother my skin (unless I roll it over a hairy part like my forearms).
How to remove ballpoint-ink on a card?
Some chemical that you can use to remove ink:Acetone (This is from nail polish cleaner)Isopropyl Alcohol (Use the odorless and colorless one. And use it only on the ink)And if you're looking for non-chemical stuff you can use:Lemon essence (Make one from lemons)Baking Soda + white vinegar + water (Mix them up into a paste dilute. Then use a soft toothbrush to clean the ink)The result varies depend on the ink and how long the card is exposed to ink. I'm not guarantee 100%. Use it by your own risk.
How to make a yellowish white shirt become perfectly white again
There are products called whitener.   You probably have minerals in your water.  Bleach + detergent is not the best combo as in some ways they compete. Split into one wash of detergent then a second wash bleach.  Don't over bleach as it is hard on the fiber.  Then a third wash with whitener.  
How to make a yellowish white shirt become perfectly white again
There are essentially two types of bleach, chlorine & oxygen.I assume you have tried the first, but not the second.Chlorine bleach is the most common - the one that smells like a really strong swimming pool, the one most likely to be kept under the sink or by the toilet.  The other type is oxygen bleach - particularly effective on organic fibres.Oxygen bleach, hydrogen peroxide, is pretty much odourless, can be made at home by adding sodium percarbonate to water. It has quite a short shelf-life once made up domestically by this method & any left over should be disposed of immediately. Continuing reaction in a sealed container can cause the container to leak, or burst because of the increased gas pressure. Any spills should be immediately flushed with copious water.Any left over can safely be poured down the sink & flushed down with water. The byproducts are just hydrogen & oxygen.The name I know best as a household washing whitener which contains peroxide is 'Vanish' - though whether that is UK market only, or truly international, I don't know. Supermarkets also have own-brands, very similar.Products of that type will contain other detergents & optical brighteners [blue & fluorescent dyes] to enhance the appearance still further.  You can actually buy sodium percarbonate on eBay & similar sites & make the solution up yourself. It's considerably cheaper that way, but needs careful dry storage (eg an old Vanish container, suitably labelled ;-) & of course contains no additional detergent/brightener, so needs to be used in conjunction with a regular washing detergent for best results.There are also liquid cleaning products tried on the domestic/household market - usually as surface cleaners rather than laundry -  but they don't seem to have gained much traction & are harder to find than they once were. Look for 'Oxy' or 'Oxygen' somewhere in the product name or description.Oxygen bleach is also pretty good on 'organic' stains, but not 'chemical' - wine will come out better than marker pen, for example.Note that cotton & other natural fibres are far more likely to come out white with this method than artificial fibres, which can yellow over time & cannot be brought back to white by bleaching.
How to remember mental notes
I'm confused by the example you've used; you're not going to put the diaper in the bin till the baby's dressed and somewhere safe (on the floor, in bed, in a chair, whatever). When you put the diaper in the bin, that's when you empty it as well. If you are putting it in the bin immediately because it doesn't mean leaving the baby unattended (because its nearby) then  don't - put it on top of the bin, that way you'll see it when you're done with baby and remember to empty it.If you really have a baby, I'm not surprised you're forgetting to do tasks, but the only way to remember what you need to do is by doing it as soon as you think about it, or making a note of it, or use tricks like the one I mention above to trigger your memory at an opportune moment. If, say, you're in the shower and you remember something you need to do, just repeat it to yourself till you're done in the shower, then either make a note of it somewhere useful that you'll actually remember to listen to or look at, or better still, do it immediately if possible. Tricks can be useful - if I need to order a prescription drug from the chemist, but its night time, I leave the pack from the last supply in front of my electric kettle at bedtime, so when I get up in the morning, I notice it there because its in the way and that's unusual... and make the call, so that kind of thing.
What can be used besides rice to keep moisture out of salt?
Now included with many medication containers of tablets that might attract moisture is a small hard silica plastic like barrel  about 1/2 inch (~1cm) long, in the container. It is a desiccant and is safe and does not breakdown. This could be used in the salt container.
How to Get Rid of Bed Hair Without a Shower
I have two suggestions:Sleep with your doo-rag : Use a shorter doo-rag, it will not irritate you when you sleep and dont use a thick one or you will get sweaty and effects your comfort.Try waking up every 3 or 4 hours. This may be unhealthy but you can try. Wake up and enjoy your snacks than brush your hair anytime you want to go to bed and try to diminish movements on the bed.
How to avoid a loud, embarrassing sneeze?
While the sensation is building up, try to force the sneeze out, with all your willpower. It sounds weird but actually works.Anytime I was on the verge of sneezing and tried to force it out and get it over with, the need to sneeze subsided. Using that actively requires a little bit more willpower, since you're trying to build up the intention to do something you actually don't want to while trying to avoid doing it involuntarily.Make sure to blow your nose afterwards, the cause of irritation will probably still be somewhere in your sinuses.
How does one efficiently clean-up loose hair strands from one's back after washing hair in the shower? Is there a gadget designed to help with this?
I would use a cleaning brush, also called neck duster, after drying off. You've probably seen your hairdresser use them to clean off your neck before taking the cape off. However, you might need to modify the handle for comfortable use on your own back.http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/c~AAAOSwstxU7Ic7/$_35.JPGAnother option would be a rubber lint roller. The hair strands stick to the roll due to its texture, so it works without adhesive. Just wash off with warm water.http://www.promo-wholesale.com/Upfiles/Prod_r/Lint-Remover_20090637700.jpgOne more alternative is those old-fashioned lint brushes. They tend to be less abrasive as even many hair brushes to avoid damaging the fabric.
Make torn patent leather look less ugly?
Maybe you can refinish your boots.Most likely, your boots were made with Leather Luster. This is a product that you paint on to the boot and allow to dry. It's a kind of enamel paint. This will give you an almost "instant" mirror finish with low maintenance. However, this finish will crack (as you've discovered) and will be next to impossible to remove. It should only be used on surfaces that will not bend.If you remove the residual loose finish, you can get and reapply a new coat on the damaged parts of your boots.
Good way to prevent phone camera from touching table
For a hacker solution, replace the sticky tack with strips of duct tape, sticky side to the case, and stack a few on top of each other to control the thickness.  Use colored duct tape and/or have different shapes/areas for the different layers if you want to get artsy. Starting with a slightly wider base and tapering a bit to the upper layers will help avoid a "sudden" extra thickness that is more likely to get caught on things. For something that looks less like a hack job, a "phone wallet" sticks on to the back of a phone and allows you to put in an ID, RFID transit card, credit card, or whatever else you want to put there, and this would add some thickness in a large, flat surface that could be the primary point of contact when the camera is laid flat.  This might provide some of the extra thickness you seek, without a 1:1 increase in net bulk of stuff in your pocket.  Most of these stick on with various gel-like or sticky surfaces; some of the more flexible or silicone-style ones would probably fit into the textured surface better than the more rigid ones.  Branded versions of these are commonly used as corporate giveaways (online example here).  You can purchase some custom items for your giveaway here (credit as image source; I have no direct experience with any firm mentioned in this post).
Make torn patent leather look less ugly?
This is a Looooooong answer ‘cuz it’s a loooooooong process.This is a simple procedure but it’s not easy and will take some time to undo the damage already done to the boots. When you’re finished, you’ll have a mirror shine. This is the technique used for polishing boots for a military dress inspection.You will require very fine sandpaper, clean polishing cloths (clean cotton dusting rag) or cotton balls/wool/etc., boot polish, a small bowl of water, a shoe brush, strong motivation, and a generous amount of elbow grease.Remove the laces.Carefully remove the material that has torn and lifted. Trim the edges near the surface without pulling off the enamel that still remains attached to the boot. A pair of small scissors may be helpful. Normally, one starts with boots in slightly better condition.Smooth the rough edge with the sandpaper and try to make it as even as possible. Try not to remove much material when doing this. You want to make the surface look more normal than they do in your photos.Now, you’re ready to start to rebuild the finish with polish. Brush off any dirt or dust on the boot, from heel to toe.Wrap the duster cloth around your index finger, making sure there are no wrinkles. Apply a medium layer of polish to the boot using the duster and your finger. Rub it in until a faint shine starts to show.Once the faint shine comes through and the polish has been worked into the boot, take your index finger and the cloth and dip it lightly into the water, and start rubbing it into the boot over the polish in small circles about an inch wide. Keep doing this until a greater shine comes through and the swirls start to disappear.Leave it to dry for a few minutes, and then once dry, take your index finger again and apply a thin layer of polish to the boot, start rubbing it in until an even better shine comes through, then apply the water to it using the method in Step 3. Leave to dry again.Take the damp index finger and apply a tiny dot of polish to the boot and work in till it shines. Make sure that the cloth is very damp but not dripping. Do the whole boot paying more attention to the damaged partsRepeat Step 5 until you get the desired level of shine. You should apply maybe about 8-9 layers as it gives best shine.Take the soft shoe brush and buff the boot all over until it starts to shine, then take the soft cloth and buff again until desired shine is obtained.Repeat until happy with results.TipsUse a Kiwi™ brand polish, as other brands will probably tarnish your boots and contain chemicals that will make them crackThe back of a teaspoon can be used to press normal polish into cracks in the boot before adding a coat of parade gloss to give the shine.Apply the polish to the sole edges as well. Boots look much neater and greater if they are cleaned literally from ground to top.To get a gleaming shine, use Kiwi™ Parade Gloss polish AFTER a base of Kiwi™ Shoe Polish as it contains silicone which makes the shoe/boot much shinier - BUT will make the boots crack IF it is used as the base layer.Another point to think about is to melt the polish onto the boot/shoe - sit the polish tin in hot water to soften to a thin paste and rub in.You can also use vinegar instead of warm water for improved results.Use more water than polish.More good boot shining tips from soldiersFirst get a lot of polish on your boots and melt with heat do this repeatedly until you have a good base on it. Then buff. Next, take a small amount of polish and apply in small circles. Breathe (like you would into cold hands—hot breath). Then, do small circles. Repeat until you can no longer see the circles.Careful not actually light the polish on fire when you heat it. Unless, of course, you want your boot to start flaking.The best thing I‘ve found is to just use ‘Kiwi™ Parade Gloss‘ instead of the regular black Kiwi™. get‘s ‘em shiny enough to pass an inspection.The only way to get a really good (and durable) shine is to build up many thin layers. If you try to glob it on, or use some ‘trick‘, you may get an impressive shine, but it won‘t last and therefore, won‘t protect the leather. Of course you can‘t just take a new pair of boots out of the box and expect to get a good spit shine. I would suggest simply brush shining them while you break them in. Then after a few weeks you should have a good enough base to spit shine. Only spit shine the toe and heel (the hard non-flexible parts); if you spit shine the leather where it flexes, it will crack. Use cotton balls, a  little  bit of water and a  little  bit of kiwi, and make small, circular motions with very light pressure. After a few months, you‘ll find your boots require less work to get them looking good.Of course, if you‘re going into the field, your main concern is protecting and waterproofing the leather, so a good brush shine should be sufficient.You need a good base coat applied thickly and brushed off.  After 20 or so of those then you spit shine with regular kiwi.  Many small applications.  If you apply it thickly it WILL crack and then you‘re stuck with bad boots.  A burn shine is a very risky gamble.  I‘ve seen it work and the result is impressive.  The other 99 out of 100 times the boots will be completely ruined.  So here it is:  Base coats. Then, many (4 per day is what I do for the first month) thin coats of regular Kiwi™--Parade Gloss is a gimmick.  After the first month, you have enough of a shine built up that you can actually slack off somewhat. Eventually, one quick shine will do it.In order to reduce the chance for the boots to crack, you will always shine them once and then wear them for a bit.  Walk around.  Always wear them after shining, then shine them some more.It IS possible to do a "burn shine" without actually involving an open flame... you only need the polish to melt, and it doesn‘t take that much heat to do it. You can achieve the desired effect using a hair dryer on a hot setting, or you can use a heat gun if you happen to have one. Using a lighter in close proximity to the boot, without burning the leather itself, also isn‘t that hard. Just hold the lighter close to the boot until the polish melts (about 0.5 seconds).Of course, all of this should be done as your final coat of polish after applying many, many base layers. I‘ve gotten really consistent results with it, probably because I put the time into those 3-4 coats each time I polish before the burn polish layer. If you‘re trying to find a quick, easy way, it won‘t work!!!I‘ve heard horror stories of cadets who use windex, turtle wax, candle wax, vaseline, and all sorts of other garbage on boots, but for the long-term, nothing wields a good result like a little elbow grease.Melt the wax IN the can!  Light it up with a lighter, let the top melt, put the lid back on to put the flame out.  You will have a layer of liquid polish.  I found it easier to apply and fill any divots, scuffs, etc., with a small round boot brush.After applying a thin layer of this and allowing it to dry, I then buffed with the soft cloth, re-applied polish, and then buffed again.For some reason I always had at least 30 minutes to work on my boots so I constantly buffed them using just Kiwi™ and horsehair brush. After a while, I needed just a quick buff and it was inspection ready.
How to fix plastic hinges, or prevent them from breaking?
I would add a few layers of clear adhesive tape (like Scotch tape) over the hinges while they're still working properly. The tape is flexible.  It should reinforce the hinge a bit.  And if the hinge breaks, the tape will keep acting as a hinge in its place.EDIT: @DangerZone points out that packing tape is more durable than Scotch tape. Cut strips of packing tape to the correct width before you stick them over your plastic hinges.
How to find out what size storage is needed?
I would suggest doing a rough measurement of floor space around each of the larger items of furniture since in general they can't be stacked. Smaller items of furniture such as lamps or small chairs can often be packed around or on top of larger pieces of furniture. Keep in mind depending on the type of furniture you have it might be possible to disassemble items (such as a bed frame) and then stack the pieces so that they take up a smaller space. For smaller items, try and figure out approximately how many boxes of a certain size you will need for your belongings. Companies like Uhaul and most office supply stores often sell storage boxes that are uniform in size and can often be stacked as long as the contents are not that heavy (a good guess would be about 3-4 boxes high depending on item weight and type/quality of boxes. If you can determine the number of boxes required for your smaller items you can add them up to get a rough estimate of the area they will take up when stacked in your storage space.Once you have a rough idea of the floor space required for your furniture and the amount of floor space required for the stacks of boxes just add the two areas for a rough estimate. Keep in mind it is always a good idea to estimate a bit high. If your estimate of required area is very close to the size of the storage locker, it would probably be worth going with the next size up just to be sure everything fits.One more tip: When moving furniture in a mobile storage container it is generally a good idea to separate adjacent and stacked items with a blanket or towels so that they don't rub together and damage each other during the move.
How do you plug a pinhole leak in a fuel tank without emptying it?
Bar soap. Rub it into it the pinhole and the fat in the soap will plug it. High-fat content soap such as Ivory works better. Obviously this will only work on pinholes, and I've only tested this on plastic tanks, though it will probably work on metal ones too.Then, roughen up the surface with some 40 grit sandpaper, clean the tank with some degreaser and patch the hole with your material of choice. I suggest a more permanent solution such as JB Weld (which has held up fine for me).If you don't care about the tiny amount of fuel that leaks out and you just need to satisfy the mechanic so your car passes the safety test, just using soap and cleaning the tank well so you can't tell there's a leak might work. However, it takes all of three minutes to mix up some JB Weld and permanently fix it, so you might as well do it right.Note: Pinhole leaks in steel tanks often indicate that the tank is rusting from the inside out and you will continue to have leaks. In which case you will need to empty and remove the tank to fix it properly, or replace it all together. This doesn't apply to plastic, since plastic doesn't rust.
Good way to prevent phone camera from touching table
I seem to post about this stuff so often I'm going to end up sounding like an advert for it - I have no affiliation, I just like the stuff, it works for a million things, so here goes...SugruThey have an example putting bumpers on the corners of a phone to prevent screen & camera touching the table, but you could easily modify that to a very subtle stripe across the phone, either side of the camera [Use black & no-one will even notice it]It goes on like Plasticene, Play-Doh, Silly Putty etc then cures to a rubberised plastic. Once cured it's pretty permanent. I've actually used it to fix chips on coffee mugs, which have since been through the dishwasher hundreds of times.A quick sketch based on your original photo...
Good way to prevent phone camera from touching table
So here is what I did with my work phone last time. I have a new one now, and its camera is actually recessed so no need. I wish I had taken a photo of it, would be easier to explain. Also, my work phone was IP67 so I felt confident I could work on it in my hobby room. I take absolutely no responsibility for your phone ;)Anyway here goes: I bought some of these, silicone muffin inlays or moulds or whatever. I have no idea how kitchen people use these, but it is something muffin like. I found only pink ones when I searched now, but I think you can get them in any color imaginable. I had grey ones. Now, cut out the wavy part, keep the bottom. From the bottom, cut out, as precise as you think is necessary a hole that is shaped like the profile of your camera (I am a perfectionist about these things, but you really don't need to be) Then, glue it around the camera. These things are not very thick, maybe you need two slices. I did. If you need more slices, make the first one glued have half the diameter of the second one (if size allows). The idea is to have both pieces glued to the phone. Silicone does not take glue very easy so glueing two silicones to each other halves the chance of success. Rub the silicone with some 60 sanding paper and don't use any sort of glue, two compund epoxies should do the trick alternatively there are glues that specifically works on silicone. Use one of them. Be sure to compress the silicone discs so a little glue bleeds out around the edges. Use this to "smooth" the edges.Now you have a round disc covering your camera, it is slippery, lipophobic and hydrophobic so it won't get dirty or stuck as much as any other material (rubber, felt etc).

How to cause my cat to bring in a dead thing
I would say, you should praise your cat. Then she might do it again. I'm not sure if supporting anyone or anything to kill stuff is a good thing, but that was not the question.
How to cause my cat to bring in a dead thing
Many cats are only occasional hunters, and even if they catch something (mouse, small bird, etc.), they'll only bring it to their human occasionally.  It's a reasonable approximation to say your cat brings you a mouse because they like you and can see you're unable to hunt for yourself -- and since cats aren't big on charity, they'll do so only when they're in the mood.As noted in another answer, praising her when she does bring in a creature is probably the best thing you can do to make it more likely she'll do it again -- but how long it'll be until next time isn't something you can influence much.  Next time she hunts successfully and feels like sharing with that big, clumsy, nearly toothless cat who none the less shares with her, she'll bring you another mouse (or whatever).
How to clean crevices of electronics without compressed air?
Anything that creates a stream of air:  compressorleaf blowerhair dryer if it has a no heat optionshop vacuum that has an exhaust port  I used to have a computer shop have blown out over 1000.  For a keyboard, I like the compressor with a nozzle as it is hard to blow them out and they are not very sensitive.  You can even vacuum on the keyboard.The downside to the compressor is you can get some moisture.  I have never lost one to moisture but for the motherboard, I prefer the shop vacuum. IMPORTANTBlock the fans before blowing them out.  I use a small screwdriver. With a compressor, you can get enough speed to spin (wreck) the bearings.  The power supply will be the dirtiest.  Blow it out in each direction.It is very hard to get into a laptop to clean it, but more important is it is smaller and the little fans and little fins can get impacted.

What is the best way to tape a cardboard box?
How to securely seal a cardboard box with tapeBefore you put anything into a cardboard box, you should tape up the bottom of the box. If you don’t, and only fold the bottom of the box flaps over each other, the box could collapse when lifted. You don’t want your best china in pieces all over the floor!TIP: Never interlock the flaps of the box as it reduces the strength of the box.TIP: Optional The quickest and easiest way to seal a cardboard box is to use a handheld tape dispenser which applies the tape tightly to the box and helps reduce tape waste.To provide extra protection and ensure all the flaps of the box are sealed, use the letter “H” seal method used by most moving companies.  It is called the letter “H” method as once complete, the tape on the box will look like a capital letter “H”.TIP: The “H” seal method will also reveal any evidence of tampering with the box because of the quantity of tape that would have to be removed.Fold two of the smaller box flaps in followed by the two largerones.Seal the edges of the cardboard box going across the whole length ofthe box where the flap edges join.  When doing this, allow anoverhang of tape.  Fold the overhang of tape to the side of thecardboard box.Seal the edges of the cardboard box going across the whole length ofeither side of the box where the flaps were closed. When doing thisallow an overhang of tape. Fold the overhang of tape to the side ofthe cardboard box.Pack the box. Ensure the contents are adequately protected by usingbubble wrap, polythene, loose fill, or air-cushion packaging.Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3, above, to seal the top of the box.Once complete, your cardboard box will be sealed on all openings and the tape will resemble the letter “H” on the top and bottom of the box. This method will provide optimal support for the box contents. It’s always better to use extra tape and provide a double layer if you are boxing very heavy items.
How to get that good smell to stick around [shampoo, cologne]
Invest in a small spray bottle that you can carry in your pocket or backpack, filled with some of your cologne. Spray as necessary, but be aware you grow accustomed to your smell and therefore it may seem more weak when it is in fact strong to others around you.Shampoo smell is dependent on how long your hair is, but others should not be able to smell it when a decent distance away from you.

How to remove/hide/destroy senstive information written on paper without a machine?
Ripping it up is as secure as the obfuscation you can apply to the task.A shredder is actually not a very secure method, unless your total shredded quantity is high. Re-assembly is just a jigsaw puzzle & the puzzle pieces are all in the same box. Forensics experts are well-practised at this.Let's say, just for example, you have a small 2" square post-it note with a phone number on it, which you wish to destroy.If you tear it in half, each half contains not enough information to be useful to any 'spy', so let's take this further.  First tear it in half right across the numbers, so one half has the top of the numbers, the other has the bottom of the numbers.Take one half & tear it into sections small enough that there's only one or two of your half numbers on each piece.Walk round the office & drop pieces in different bins as you go.That ought to be sufficient obfuscation for one half.Put the other half in your pocket & take it home.Repeat the same tear & redistribute as you did in the office; some bits in the regular trash, some in the recycle, some in the green compostibles bin, assuming you have all 3 types.Alternatively, throw out a random ⅓ of the pieces each week for 3 weeks, into the same bin.That ought to reduce the chances of finding & re-assembling all the pieces to as close to zero as possible.You could, of course, first write random letters over it and scribble over that, which will increase the complexity still further.This is a method I also use for expired credit cards...using scissors, of course.Though the method is not 'quick' it requires very little effort overall.

How to remove/hide/destroy senstive information written on paper without a machine?
I sometimes find scraps of paper around the house on which I either wrote down or printed out sensitive information in a hurry before throwing it off on some obscure table and forgetting about it.Here's how I destroy said information.For PensSince I write most things in gel pen, I have found isopropyl alcohol or any form of water to be the best solvent for obfuscating information. This also helps soften the paper for tearing.Simply wet the paper with either solvent of choice to cause the ink to dissolve and spread over the paper. If water doesn't work, use the isopropyl.For PencilLightly dab some water on your eraser and rub vigorously on the pencil tracing you want destroyed. This causes the paper to roll up into tiny wet cylinders that are effectively impossible to unravel.Do bear in mind that this method does destroy the paper quite effectively as well.For PrintOne of my favourite (but not very environmentally friendly) method of getting rid of printed information is by printing a bunch of random garbled data over it.Take a plain text document for example. Print over the text document in alternating directions a couple of times and it's almost effectively unintelligible.Alternatively, the more environmentally friendly method is to use the pencil method. It's not as effective (printed text is not as fine as pencil traces), but it gets the job done most of the time.Most of these methods were actually discovered by the best possible way to destroy something - catastrophic accidents - on some rather important documents as well, if I might add.The very reason that these methods can be easily applied to anyone, anywhere in the world, is because such accidents are ubiquitous, and the materials required to cause them are usually quite abundant and common.
How to remove/hide/destroy senstive information written on paper without a machine?
Here's what I typically do, scribble over it, using a black permanent marker - if you have one. If you do not have a black marker, use a pen with the same color of ink and repeatedly write the number eight over the words. Once this is done, cut it into strips, then cut those strips into small diamonds by cutting across the them diagonally.  Also, as mentioned above, you can use rubbing alcohol on certain types of ink, I believe water or acetone would also be effective. If the information is written in pencil then you could likely just erase it and then - for good measure - cut it up as described above. Also as mentioned, you could eat the paper; however, I don't think that I would recommend that. Although it would work beautifully, you really don't want to ingest ink, nor do you know what could have been used on that paper during manufacturing. 
How to compensate for sinking / uneven floor in office
When I was renting my old house I wanted to use one of the guest bedrooms as an office. I didn't want to use one of those plastic mats for my office chair and the floor was a bit unlevel at the wall so my desk was going to be tilted backward. Since I was renting the house I couldn't tear out the carpet or get the floor fixed, so I decided to build a platform just big enough for my desk and chair to sit on. If you are ok with a bit of DIY construction work, I would suggest building something similar. I used 4 sheets of 1/2" plywood to build a 1-inch tall base by placing two sheets side by side and then placing the second two sheets perpendicularly on top of the first two. This gave me an 8ftx8ft square platform. I secured the sheets of plywood together with 3/4 inch screws placed every 0.5-ft in a square pattern across the platform. Once I finished building it, I used some shims to level the platform. Then to make it presentable I applied wood grain peel and press floor tiles to the top of the platform and around the edges. In total, I only spent around $100 for all of the materials and was able to put it together in an afternoon.  It solved both the carpet and the unlevel floor problem simultaneously and actually looked really good. When I moved out of the house It was pretty easy to dismantle since it was just screwed together.

I often use your idea of writing over the letters with other letters.  But I always write over every letter with an "8" and then an "X".  That makes every letter look like exactly the same weird figure.(I know we're talking about manually-written letters, but I don't have a scanner near me so I just made the picture in MS Paint.)
How to avoid scratching door on garage door frame
Get a few tall traffic codes - the kinds that are tall enough to see from a car window, and tip over easily.Set them just inside the garage door frame on either side.  When any of the drivers are coming into the garage, if a cone tips over, they'll need to back up and try again.You could do a similar thing by hanging baseballs or something similar just inside the garage door frame.  If the driver bumps either of the hanging baseballs, they're too close!
How to not feel so sticky after swimming?
If you are exerting yourself during your swim lessons, then your body temperature is elevated when you get out of the pool and you'll be sweating even though you don't feel it while you're in the pool.  You need to lower your body temperature before you put your clothes on.  There are two ways I've used to cool off before getting dressed.If the pool temperature is typical (around 80 degrees F), i.e. not too warm, just stay in the pool for a few minutes to cool off.  Your normal skin temperature is usually above 90 degrees so full immersion in 80 degree water will cool you off.  The longer you can stay immersed in lower temperature water, the cooler your body will be when you get out of the pool.Take a cool or cold shower.  Most people like the feeling of a hot shower but if you're already overheated, this just makes the problem worse.  You'll be sweating worse after a hot shower.  Take as cold a shower as you can stand and spend extra time with the cool water directed at your head where your body's thermal regulating system is located.  A cool head is a cool body. Again, the longer you can do this, the lower your body temperature will be when you get dressed.Ideally you should do both of these, but obviously time is the constraint here.  As a final measure, I sometimes leave my shirt unbuttoned and untucked until I cool off a bit and use my towel to blot up the sweat off my body for a few minutes. 
A complex book with a spread containing 3 pages A4
Packing tape (and most other tapes) deteriorates over time. The plastic backing often slips across the glue, leaving the glue exposed, so you end up with a sticky mess.You need a tape that's designed to be used on paper. In my experience, Scotch Magic 810 Invisible Tape works well for this application. Other brands also exist, look for a tape that's 'acid-free' and designed for use on paper.But even with a good tape, binding the spine is difficult. And in the places where you have used tape, the book will become thicker than elsewhere. The page that sticks out must be narrower than A4, so it stays clear of the binding. How much narrower depends on the binding.  For this sort of project, instead of improvising I can recommend a visit to your local photocopy shop. They usually have A3 printers (avoiding the tape altogether) and for a few pounds/Euros/dollars, they can bind your book in a variety of ways. 
Does anyone know of a 'homemade' sunscreen?
I assume when you say sunscreen you mean sunscreen lotion, as in putting on your skin. According to Wikipedia, the ingredients that actually block the UV radiation in sunscreen lotion are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, and these metallic powders are mixed with a heavy oil to make a lotion that doesn't wash (or sweat) off easily.Commercial lotions may also have some other organic chemicals that also block UV, but not to the same extent that titanium and zinc powder do. Although the type of oil you mix into a home made recipe version is up to you, you will probably need to buy one or both titanium dioxide powder or zinc oxide powder to use if you plan on mixing your own. The only health risk of DIY sunscreen is inhaling the powders prior to mixing them in oil; this is not healthy for you but neither chemical is poisonous. One other disadvantage of homebrewed sunblock is you may end up looking like you are covered in white paste depending on how thick you smear it on yourself.I checked Amazon for prices and food grade titanium dioxide powder runs about $20 a pound, and zinc oxide powder goes for half that.
How can I mass produce confetti?
Once I used an hole puncher to create confetti for carnival. If you have enough time you can get one from Amazon.

The confetti were really beautiful, all round and perfect. It was fun and relatively fast! I was young, 10-12 y.o., so if you have children you can let them play with it with no risks.

If you have a lighter or a match stick, burning it will be a good option. Off-course, it's better to burn it on a metal surface away from flammable substances. If you can't find metal surface, you can try to burn it by holding the paper's edge in hand. You can easily extinguish -- just by blowing air through your mouth -- this fire since it is a small paper. On some papers, the writing will be visible even after burning. In such cases, it is best to crush the burnt paper to powder and throw it in dust bin. This method ensures that the paper doesn't even exist to read the content.

How to get cat urine smell out of wooden floors?
You cannot "remove" cat soaked urine odors from Hardwood. The only option is to refinish "Sand" the floors. Any undesirable boards that turned black from the urine acid will need to be replaced. After sanding it is best to use 3 coats of finish. Swedish finish is recommended. Not many hardwood floor guys are proficient with swedish finish application so do your homework. The alcohol in swedish helps kill any bacteria left from the urine. Oil polyurethane would be 2nd choice but takes much longer to harden. I've seen waterbased finish absorb the odor. 30 year hardwood flooring refinisher.
How to remove rust stains from cloth?
First off, don't use bleach; bleach works by oxidizing the stain, which tends to make rust stains worse.  There's a commercial product called "Iron Out" that uses a thiocyanate to very effectively remove rust stains, but you can do the same with oxalic acid, if you have access to that and not to the commercial product.Oxalic acid can be obtained from rhubarb leaves (it's the toxic component in those leaves, so avoid ingesting it and wear gloves while preparing and using the solution).  If you have that plant in your garden, though, you'll want to take precautions to avoid replacing the rust stain with a green chlorophyll stain if you use rhubarb as a rust stain remover.

How to destroy personal information on courier package containers?
What I use in these situations is a Sharpie Magnum.  In my experience, these are fairly good at blacking out information on package labels. But you have to keep in mind that most of this information is fairly public and readily available (not to mention any package handler had access to it before it was handed off to you).  You could always take an extra step and scratching bits of the labels off with a knife or scissors, but that's probably not necessary in most cases. If a bad guy was on the lookout to do harm to someone, the information they could get from a blacked out shipping label would likely not be worth their time anyway.  Try to obscure (or even cut out, if you want to sacrifice convenience for security) parts that are most sensitive, then black out everything.  In case you don't feel like buying a sharpie, I'm certain something like a nice coat of black spray paint would do the trick. But unless it's particularly sensitive information (which should never be on your package anyway. If it is, there are other issues here), worry more about making it inconvenient to retrieve, rather than impossible. Destroying a document is just on another level altogether.
How to destroy personal information on courier package containers?
I recommend getting a ball-point pen the same color as your printed information, then drawing tight loops and curlicues over the top of the letters you want to obscure. The loops and curlicues will make it confusing to figure out what each letter/number is. A wide, permanent marker may still allow the letters and numbers to show through, especially on close inspection.Follow up the curlicues with a coating of opaque correction fluid (like Liquid Paper or Wite-Out).

Organise cables which often need to be replugged on the wall
A quick hack is to tie the cables to each other. Whichever is plugged in will hold the other. No need to retie them when swapping plug (the knot stays).
Organise cables which often need to be replugged on the wall
I recommend purchasing a velcro cable tie roll. The hooks are on one side and the loops on the other so you can cut short lengths e.g. 15cm as reusable cable ties.

How to remove the wheels from casters on a chair, to remove hair?
I succeeded, and I share with you.I used a 9" channel-locks pliers, which fit perfectly between one wheel and the leg frame.  Carefully pry from side to side until one wheel pops off.  This will do some chewing on the frame and the inside of the wheel, but these are not visible areas.  Don't be afraid of breaking. This is tough ABS plastic, and if the clog is bad enough you'll do it!Pull the roll of hair off the exposed axle.  Now instead of prying the other wheel off, pop the whole axle out by closing the pliers and pinching the end of the axle towards the other side of the frame.Pull the other roll of hair off.  Reassemble.Here's the before and after.  I did two chairs, each with five casters.  Nothing broke.  Second one took 7 min. total.  Very satisfying.
How to remove the wheels from casters on a chair, to remove hair?
You can pop the wheels from their axles with a large flat-headed screwdriver, they're just push-fit.Speed is the trick - they're somewhat resistant to a continued hard force, but if you 'surprise' them with a rapid motion, they will come off relatively easily. Prising near the axle itself is much better for the wheel than putting force near the rim.Pop them back with your hands, heel of your palm or side of a clenched fist - a sharp blow is all it needs....but note that you weaken the joint each time you do it, to the point that eventually the wheels will just fall off when you move the chair.Nissim's answer is actually very good for the second wheel of each pair, as it obviates the need to remove the second wheel & therefore weaken it.
How to level a paella
To check if the pan is level, place it on a surface you know is horizontal and use a spirit level. Or pour some water into the pan, and measure the water level at different locations using a ruler. If at one location the water level is higher, the pan is not level. Then you have to check if your cooking range is level. Again, use a spirit level. If the range is not level, adjust it (generally, a range has adjustable feet). If you have a gas range, you have to check the level of the range itself, but also the cast-iron frames where you place your pans. If the frame is bent, you have to wrap some sheet metal (preferably iron) around the prongs to shim the prong to the correct height. For other ranges (e.g. electric and induction): never use shims between the hot plate and the pan. Adjust the feet of the range instead.

Though a metal detector would find lumps of any type of metal, such as nails in the wall, a grid dip meter (GDM), used by electronics and radio amateurs, or "hams, could identify a closed loop of a good conductor such as gold alloy. Calibrate the GDM by comparison with another ring of close to the same diameter, and then scan each room from floor to bureau-top. You'll need to be within 30 cm or so, so if the ring's under a bed, take off the mattress to check underneath.

Loud neighbor living upstairs depriving me of my sleep!
Use a white noise machine, they continuously emit noise (usually actually Brownian or pink noise) that drowns out the noise created by your neighbour.You can improvise one by tuning a radio receiver between frequencies and turning the volume up.Make sure your alarm is loud enough (if you are clever, you may be able to have it shut of the white noise when it sounds, I can't think of an easy way to achieve this).
Loud neighbor living upstairs depriving me of my sleep!
Some people simply don't realise how much noise they make, or how much it impinges on others.I've found - empirically, & without ever actually falling out with any noisy neighbours long-term - that one good lesson is to make your own loud noise while they're trying to sleep.  Whether this takes the form of some hefty DIY at 6am, or putting the hifi on as loud as it will go then going out for 3 hours is entirely up to you; but matching approximately like for like would feel most appropriate.When/if the neighbour enquires/complains, you then have you opportunity to discuss how thin the walls are; complete with fake apologies, "omg, I didn't realise", etc etc.  I've lived in the same apartment for 25 years & never had to do this trick twice with the same neighbour.

Depending on your sleeping habits, you may be able to use earplugs after all. Earplugs don't block all sound, they merely reduce the volume by 20-30 dB. The alarm is right next to your bed and probably loud enough to be heard through your earplugs. When you wake up at the same time every day, your body gets used to this and often starts to wake up before the alarm goes off, so even soft sounds are enough to trigger waking up. If that doesn't work, an alarm that includes a light (Wake-up light) is an option.
Hacky way to keep micro USB firmly in place?
I would try anchoring the cord to the keyboard, leaving a couple inches of slack between the anchor point and the micro USB plug.  Any pulling on the cord will stop at this point, instead of continuing to the plug and disconnecting it from the jack. Also, the cord can still be unplugged (allowing something else to be plugged into the port) while remaining anchored. Possible methods of anchoring the cord with a bit of slack at the micro USB end could be: 1) A Strip of strong tape, holding a couple of inches of the cord's length to the back panel.2) Glue, used in a similar fashion as the tape, would also work. A glue that is flexible after drying (much like the tape is flexible) will "give" a little and still hold. A  hard, brittle adhesive might crack and release the cord.Having a good length of the cord held by either of the materials will hold better than anchoring at a single point, since the stress will be transferred from the cord (and  absorbed by) a greater amount of surface area of the materials being held, and to the glue/tape itself.  -If the tape is wide enough to come over top and bottom of the keyboard it will help even more with holding the cord. -Glue should be applied thick enough to completely surround and embed the cord, since it is holding onto both the cord and the keyboard's case, while absorbing any stress on the cord.I Have used "Gorilla" brand tape or silicone-based glues for this type of cord anchor several times, and it has worked great for years on most occasions.Another option is a mechanical anchor of some sort, such as a wire clamp, or zip-type cable tie screwed-in to the keyboard.The tape solution is more temporary than the others; but I can't really see why the cord isn't permanently affixed in the first place, unless a different length was sometimes needed. If it were my keyboard, I would use a permanent anchor.

Mac Keyboard cleaning
If it's just dust, try Blu-Tac. If it's sticky, then use a soft cloth, spray Colin over the cloth, and wipe it off.
Cleaning bathroom tiles without chemicals
To clean without chemicals you'll want to explore options that do not contain matter.One possibility is to clean using sound. There are different options available, but they all work on the general premise of dislodging dust, oil, and other particles using rapid sound induced pressure fluctuations. This technique has been used for decades over a wide range of uses. Ultrasonic cleaning uses sound waves that are outside of the human auditory range (your neighbors will be happy!) and is used for cleaning things like jewelry and surgical instruments. Acoustic cleaning uses sound waves that humans can hear and are effective at cleaning larger items like grain elevators.Electromagnetic radiation provides many options, including radio waves, visible light, ultraviolet light, x-rays, and gamma rays. It's not uncommon to find cleaning products that use ultraviolet light to kill or inactivate bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms, but I'd recommend for your own safety that you steer clear of x-rays and gamma rays (despite their increased effectiveness).Avoid any kind of soap, as all of them (even the "natural" ones) contain dozens of chemicals. Vinegar should also be avoided, as it is a combination of water and the chemical acetic acid. You'll also want to avoid water, too, since it's made of the chemical dihydrogen monoxide. Just remember, if it's made out of matter it's made out of chemicals.
How do I feed my fish while I'm on vacation?
If you search Amazon (or Google) "Fish Feeder Timer" there are a large number of products which will dispense food periodically - a lot of these are under $30.Some examples - Here is a 14 day feeder for $25 Here is a feeder which willwork for 14-20 feeds depending on what you feed.
How do I feed my fish while I'm on vacation?
You can buy feeding blocks that slowly dissolve in water and reaese the food over a given period of time. They are cheap and sold with names as vacation food block, weekend food block or something similar.
Tea dispenser leaks
Adjust either the height of the dispenser or the shelf on the door of your fridge that is hitting it. These dispensers are controlled by the lever on top. Most likely what is happening is that your door shelves are just the right height to slide over the top of the front of spout but compress the back of it just enough to cause the leak. Place a cutting board under the dispenser and then it won't line up so perfectly(imperfectly?). Update: another thought... how about elevating the dispenser enough that it won't have to be slid forward for a cup to fit under the spout? If the dispenser never moves it will never be in the wrong spot.
Tea dispenser leaks
If the dispenser always sits on the same shelf in your refrigerator, put a piece of tape (like red electrical tape) on the shelf to mark the "farthest forward spot" that the dispenser can sit without leaking. The let everyone in the house know that the tea needs to be behind that line.  The tape should be a simple reminder for everyone.
Tea dispenser leaks
Put a small turntable (lazy susan) under the dispenser, and rotate it away from the front of the refrigerator when you close the door.
Tea dispenser leaks
Attach a dowel or similar item to the front of the dispenser that sticks out farther than the tab.  Attach it at such a height that it also bumps into part of the door.  If the dispenser is pulled too far forward, closing the door will actually shove it backwards.  (No, I'm not sure how to attach a dowel securely to a glass container that may have condensation on it.)This could also work with a brim all the way around the dispenser, like it's wearing a top hat.To reverse the idea, you could attach the dowel to the refrigerator door.  However, if the dispenser gets moved, this wouldn't work.

Tea dispenser leaks
I think you need to change your question. I've used one of those jugs before and it is kind of a pain to use in the fridge because you can't get your glass underneath the spout; so your friends/family may be pulling the jug forward to get some juice. Why not fix a small rubber hose on it so they don't have to move the jug? Or perhaps some sort of horizontal funnel. The main idea is that you could put something on it to redirect the liquid out past the fridge shelf so people don't need to pull the jug out to get juice. Anyway, that's how I would approach it. That way your jug could be farther back and you wouldn't get that problem (if my assumptions are correct).

How to protect coffee machine from others in a public space?
Option 1: Put a sign on the machineIn a Uni environment, I think that putting a sticker on the coffee machine telling that it is for your group only would be sufficient.If someone else uses the machine:Either he/she does not do it regularly, in which case, you probably won't care.Or it is regular, and the person will be caught one day in the action. When that happens, make a fuss, for example by sending an email to the lab mailing list.Option 2: Card reader on the machineIf you happen to be in a science/engineering department, I am sure you could find a student with enough motivation to interface the coffee machine with a card reader. Many university access cards are pretty standard, so that you can easily buy a cheap USB reader to plug in a cheap computer (e.g. Raspberry Pi) and control a relay connected to the coffee machine.This would typically cost about 100 USD and an afternoon of assembly. The advantage of the card reader option compared to other answers is that it is still very easy to make a coffee, and the coffee machine can stay pre-heated (if the relay just shuts down the buttons on the machine). The system can also be used to calculate a "coffee bill" for the users depending on how much they consume.Option 3: Make the machine look dirtyThis would work pretty well if the machine has a clear and visible water container. In that case, paint the container with transparent green paint so that it looks like the tank is full of algae.
How do I open this watch without special tools?
Screw covers have notches for the spanner wrench to grip. This cover is a snap-off press-fit cover (with a gasket inside the cover).Any sharp edged hardened steel tool (similar to a knife-edge) can be inserted between the watch case and the cover. There will be a short "groove" in the watch case where you fit the edge to "pry" the cover off.An easier (and better) way would be to bring the watch to a jeweller who will replace the battery for the cost of the battery alone. At the same time, the jeweller will set your watch correctly and possibly regulate it to keep time more accurately.

How do I install an aglet on my shoelace?
In short, you can't.You'll never get that one back on the lace without damaging it. They are made from a roll of tape, wrapped & shrunk onto the lace.Alternatives you can try.Cut it lengthways so you can re-wrap it; glue it on. Use a piece of sticky tape to hold it in place until dry.Melt the end of the lace with a flame, roll it in your fingers [carefully]. You will either get it small enough to then fit inside the existing aglet so you can again glue it on - or you'll be left with a substitute aglet that will still function. This is my usual trick for 'nylon' laces.Make a new aglet by dipping the end in wax, resin, hot-melt glue, cold glue, nail varnish etc etc & rolling into shape before it's fully set.Find a metal aglet DIY kit at a local hobby shop.Cobblers used to fit metal aglets back in the day when everybody had them - maybe see if one still does. 
Allergy relief without medicine?
You may find it beneficial to try a Neti Pot.People often use Neti Pots to flush the pollen out of some of their sinus cavities.If you choose to try a Neti Pot, make sure you use an appropriate solution mixture (typically containing pure sodium chloride and pure aluminum-free sodium bicarbonate) and distilled water.  Never use tap water, well water, or regular bottled water, as you don't want to introduce contaminants/bacteria into your sinus cavities.Some people have experimented with using Himalayan salt in a Neti Pot, but it is unknown whether or not that is a safe practice.
Massive magnification without a microscope
The original microscope, as created by Anton van Leeuwenhoek (spellings of the last name vary) in the 17th century was nothing more than a drop of water (or glycerin, which doesn't evaporate as quickly) caught in a pinhole in a metal plate, with the sample mounted on an adjustable holder.  The simple "lens" was held very close to the eye, and allowed examining an object at a close enough distance to see the "animalcules" (as he called them) in a drop of pond water.A similar setup could be cobbled together using a drop of clear liquid, mounted very close to your phone camera's lens cover.  The lens mount can be made from aluminum foil, held on the phone with tape.  Careful cutting of the foil can avoid covering the camera's flash LED, allowing good illumination of the sample (possibly aided by putting frosted tape on the LED cover, to widen the illumination angle).  Combine this with the phone's zoom, and you should be able to see individual cells in an onion slice or similar tiny details.
How do I install an aglet on my shoelace?
Rather than trying to get the same aglet back on your shoelace, wrap a small bit of adhesive tape tightly around the end of the shoelace. You could use Scotch tape, duct tape, clear packing tape, or something else you have handy. Make the tape as wide as the original aglet was, and don't wrap around more than 1-1/2 times, so the tape just attaches to itself but doesn't become too thick.You'll most likely need to handle it with more care than you usually would, but it will do the trick - and it's cheap!
How do I install an aglet on my shoelace?
Find some heat shrink tubing (auto parts stores sell it, as do many other stores in the auto parts section).  You want a piece that barely slips onto the lace.  Slip it on, shrink it (match or lighter flame is just right), and you're done.  Often, you'll get a choice of five colors, or black in a separate package.
Finding a gold ring lost in the house
I think there is only one way that is pretty sure to work.  One by one, empty each room of every object. You'll need an empty room or a large clear area to stage removed objects.An alternative to this, though less reliable is to picture each room as a grid.  Work methodically through the grid, lifting, opening, prying, whatever to clear that grid. This is what search parties do when looking for lost sailors, children, etc.
How can I blacken a brown pair of boots? Will black shoe polish work as I'd intend?
Shoe polish and anything else creamy/pasty will not penetrate enough, unless perhaps melted.  Needs to be something liquid and fine.  Search "black leather dye."  Four oz. runs about $5.
How can I blacken a brown pair of boots? Will black shoe polish work as I'd intend?
If you use a dye, it should work, but your best bet is to go to a professional for the job.  However, they are quite expensive, and you could be better off getting new shoes.  I suggest the dye.  It really works after a few coats.
How to decarbonate ("make flat") beverages more quickly?
Add sugar. A spoonful of sugar will bring a lot of CO2 out of solution at once. The beverage will fizz furiously, so don't fill the container to the brim or you'll spill some. Adding surface area will help too. I've done this by inserting a teaspoon, but that's too slow. I haven't tried this, but maybe using a tea infuser (an egg-shaped strainer made to contain tea leaves) is better (more surface area): stir your drink with the (empty) tea infuser.
How to decarbonate ("make flat") beverages more quickly?
Not certain about the practicality of this solution, but as a child I discovered that putting the chewed end of a stick of liquorice [the real stuff, made of 'wood'] into a fizzy drink would flatten it in seconds.The reality is likely not the liquorice itself, but the very large surface area it would present.  As an adult I've never actually tried to reproduce this, but perhaps something like a paint brush [clean of course] would reproduce that large surface area.

How to decarbonate ("make flat") beverages more quickly?
I despise carbonated beverages so I often flatten my drinks.  In order to meet all your acceptance criteria (namely, portable and works for cans) the solution I suggest is simple.  Carry around a plastic sports bottle... must be strong enough to handle pressure but have an easy to operate lid.Transfer contents of carbonated beverage into bottleSlightly shake, to build up pressure.  Open lid to release pressure.Repeat step 2, shaking a bit more each time, until all carbonation (or as much as needed) is gone.This process usually only takes a few minutes.  With beverages in plastic bottles you can just use the bottle itself.  With glass bottles (and clean hands) you can form a seal with your finger or thumb and do the same process.  But for cans the easiest way would be a separate bottle.

How can I wear my headset and glasses in a way that doesn't hurt?
I cut small holes in the pleather that holds the pads onto the cans and slip the arms in there so that the arms are between the pads and cans rather than between the pads and my head. This means i have to put my glasses into my headphones and then my headphones onto my head, but it also means i can wear them for hours with no discomfort or distortion while maintaining isolation. the arms of my glasses do get spread by this but they have hinges that allow this.

Following are some ideas that I have seen people do when they don't have dental floss or toothpick:1) Use visiting card (Material - Non Tearable PET) which have 260 gsmthickness. (Thin enough to get between two teeth.) This is effectiveas it is thin enough to get between two tooth, and disturb the particle state (Suggest you to clean a visiting card before use)2) Use of waterpiks 3) Gargling water only in area of the subject tooth4) Use of tongue to remove (very difficult toremove)
How to quickly cure hiccups
From my observation,Hiccups come after a particular time interval.So first start the count when a hiccup comes and till the time the next hiccup comes.For example:- You got the next hiccup after 10 seconds.Now when the hiccup comes start the count, take a glass of water and start taking sips 2-3 seconds before your time count of hiccups and continue drinking water.It will stop if you drink the water just at time hiccup has to come.This technique always works for me.Try it.

How to easily clean dough remains after baking bread?
My own preference for homemade bread is to use a bread machine.  These can often be had very cheaply from second hand stores -- mine was $8, plus $15 for a new paddle on eBay, so $23 invested, and I downloaded the user manual for free.  Reasonably modern machines can make a huge variety of different breads, including quick breads, fruit/vegetable loaves, and even jam -- as well as providing kneaded and raised dough ready for loaf forming if you want a loaf that isn't shaped like the machine's pot (see other answers about oiling your hands if you choose to form your own loaves, nothing to clean up other than washing off the oil).With a machine, you just put the ingredients in the pot and start the machine (on a timer, even -- you can wake up to hot fresh bread for breakfast!).  Your hands never touch the dough, if you let the machine run straight through, so there's nothing to clean off them.  The dough inside the machine's pot is 100% baked into the loaf (you may find you need to scrape down the pot between mixing and kneading with a soft spatula, but the amount of dough you'll need to clean off the spatula is genuinely trivial, and if running overnight the part that didn't get scraped down will just be a crisp crust, easily removed and trashed or eaten).  Just wash the pot and paddle after removing the loaf, and you're ready to start again.And, as you already know, the ingredients cost for fresh homemade bread is about a quarter that of economy brand bread from a grocery store.  Even if you pay full retail for the machine, it'll pay for itself in a short time (hint: get your bread flour in a large bag -- 50 lb. costs about as much as two 10 lb bags -- and when you open the bag, transfer the flour to plastic buckets).
How to easily clean dough remains after baking bread?
Put a bit more flour into your mixture until it comes away clean from the bowl. I do this inside the food processor, because it is a devil to get clean otherwise. When you take the dough out you press it all together and it comes out in one piece.When kneading or rolling out, use plenty of flour (I have it in a shaker) whenever it starts to stick.

Allergy relief without medicine?
Take a placebo, and try to control any significant psychological factors. Psychology is an important factor in allergies because they are basically overreactions of a bored immune system. Basic things such as work-related stress, being in love etc. can have a significant impact. So if you were surprised by unusually strong hay fever, you might consider manipulating your psychological state:Do you have work-related stress? Tell yourself that since you are ill, there is no longer any pressure as you will just do whatever you can under the circumstances.Are you working but not experiencing significant stress levels? Put yourself under artificial pressure.If you are easily excitable that way, try a horror movie.Maybe even fall into or out of love.If you have access to a completely harmless placebo, consider taking it. The placebo effect can work even if you know you are tricking your body.Of course manipulating your psychological state could also make things worse if you don't have a good idea of what it will do to your allergy.Also, this would be the best time for getting some kind of proper infection so that your immune system has real work to do. I am just not sure how that would translate into something you can actually do...

How to decarbonate ("make flat") beverages more quickly?
Add salt. Upon adding salt, the beverage will fizz furiously. So make sure that the container is not full. I used to add little salt and it would reduce the gas in beverage.

How do I open this watch without special tools?
The watch in your picture states water resistant to 3ATM.  Therefore, it has a screw back.  Watches with backs that prise off are not water resistant.Many screw-type watch backs will have notches into which you insert the arms of a spannerTo open a screw-type watch back that doesn't have notches, like the one in your picture, a professional would use a suction tool like this:This is pressed firmly against the back to form a friction seal and twisted.As you don't want to use a specialist tool, you need to find something that forms that firm grip against the watch back.  A common trick is to use a stress ball.  Hold this in one hand and the watch in the other.  Press the ball hard into the back and twist.If you don't have a stress ball, something of similar rubber consistency will do.Don't forget that once opened, you won't be able to get the full water resistance back without specialist tools.

Finding a gold ring lost in the house
This may seem very silly but call for it. There have been studies that show calling for an inanimate object makes it easier to find. Other than that do a fingertip search, work from one end of the search surface and then work in a methodical way. For cupboards and draws, once searched put a postit note on it so you can see what you have and havent searched. Search everywhere, no matter how unlikely it is to be there. If you have searched every place it could be then it must be in a place it cant be.

How to "recharge" sodium acetate hand warmer without a stove?
Heat up water in kettle or microwave . Pour hot water into s bowl, and place Hester into hot water. It won't take 10 minutes. Make more hot water and add it to bowl as necessary to keep the water in there hot. Under NO circumstances should you put your heater in the microwave! The metal disc will start arcing and destroy microwave!.The reason they tell you not to put heater in a kettle, is so that the plastic bag doesn't get melted against the hot metal surface in kettle. You can try to "suspend" heater bag in kettle, so that it doesn't actually come in contact with the kettle's interior. Or you can wrap your heater in a cloth rag before dropping it into the kettle's water. Rag with keep plastic bag from touching kettle's hot surfaces, which is hotter than the water.

Opening a box without a knife
Commercially, there are "safety knives" with the only cutting edge on the inside of a hook; they're made specifically for opening boxes in warehouses and retail stores, but that's not much of a life hack...For non-fiber tape, I've used ball point pens.  Poke a hole, and the tape will tear easily outward from that break.  I've seen people use a fingernail for this, but mine are almost always too short to punch through the tape.For fiber tape, the only real alternatives are scissors, or the metal tab on a plastic keyring bottle opener.  You'll probably find you have to break or cut off the "hook" part (that sits on top of a crown cap when opening a bottle) to expose the metal tab for this use, but even after that modification you shouldn't have problems with such a device at an airport terminal.
How to repel ants invading my bottled water?
Try smearing a line of Vaseline all the way around your water bottle, an inch from the bottom. I have heard that ants don't know what to do about the sticky, goopy, petroleum jelly. (It's inexpensive, too!)You'll need to avoid touching it yourself, of course. It's kind of hard to wipe off.
How to fix shoes worn out inside?
I had the same problem and bought hard insoles. They do not look very comfortable, but they actually are! Because they are harder than the soft leather insoles you might not notice the unevenness. If they are still uneven, you might be able to put a piece of leather between the hard insole and the shoe, but I doubt that will be necessary.
How to remove oil without soap while washing?
The only things other than soap or detergent that will remove oil during washing are extremely hot water (like genuinely boiling!) or alcohol.  Neither of these is likely to be more available than dishwashing or hand soap when you're washing out your lunch box in the work or school lunch room.You might explore whether you can get dish detergent in little packets (like the ones with condiments in them from fast food restaurants); you could bring these with you and be able to properly wash your lunch box and utensils each day.
How to remove oil without soap while washing?
I would try a putting few drops of dishwashing soap on a paper towel, then put that in a Ziploc bag with your lunchbox.One more idea that I got from cleaning cast iron skillets in my home.  You're not supposed to use soap on a cast iron skillet because it can remove the seasoning.  The recommended way to clean them is to use salt and water.  From what I've seen a paste of salt with a few drops of water will do a pretty good job of removing excess oil from a cast iron skillet, it doesn't take off 100% though.  It would probably also work for your lunchbox, it's kind of abrasive though and would encourage rust depending on the material the lunchbox is made of.
How to remove oil without soap while washing?
Paper towel - this will absorb oil 95%Flour - Spread flour inside lunch box and rub the flour around thesurface. This is best solution as it absorbs most of the oil. Basedon my experience, I would say 99%To avoid spreading of oil within box surface - keep a aluminium foil (or worst case plastics sheet) inside surface of box before putting food.

What would be the easiest way for you to be able to dry your footwear? I would suggest an oven you heat up for less than a minute empty. Turn it off. Then put your shoes in it on a tray that is room temperature. But if you do that wrong, you will have burnt shoes. :( But an oven that is already heated just a little bit will dry anything out pretty well. Also, you can put shoes in a regular dryer, or in the sun coming through a window. Anything to get the temperature up just a little bit so the water evaporates faster.Also, and this may not apply to you at all, but most smell from shoes come from bacteria that grow naturally on your feet. That bacteria will build up throughout the day in your socks, then be washed away when you wash your socks. If you are NOT wearing socks, you will have LOTS of bacteria in your shoes, and they will always stink, wet or not. The only way to get rid of it is to wash your shoes regularly, which is not good for them.Good luck!
How to deodorize the bad odour in footwear due to wetness?
The smell is caused by bacteria. Place the shoes in a freezer overnight and allow them to warm up to room temperature normally the next morning. This process will kill the bacteria.Consider placing the shoes in a plastic bag before putting them in the freezer to prevent contact with food.

How to deodorize the bad odour in footwear due to wetness?
To deodorize sneakers and tennis shoes, an easy solutions to eliminate odor is to wash them in a laundry machine with detergent, cold water and no spin cycle. Before washing, separate the shoe laces and insoles from the shoes.It is really important to turn off the spin cycle or the shoes will be destroyed. (cough, cough)After washing, you'll need to dry them. Leave them in the sun for a couple of days, on a cloths line hanging from the tongue. If you live in a humid area where two days isn't enough, consider investing in a shoe dryer.Various sources on the internet warn to avoid using bleach with the shoes in the washing machine. I personally always use a little bit of bleach just to make sure the shoes are perfectly disinfected.Please note, don't do this plan with leather shoes or sandals.
What is the best way to recondition a whiteboard?
I am a maintenance person at a facility that has 30+ whiteboards.  I have done ALL of the suggestions I found online.  The whiteboards we have here will stay clean and work fine for 3 days after cleaning, but the ghosting appears and then quickly becomes a huge mess.  I have used: 99% Iso alch., re-conditioning rubs (aka wax, rub on rub off) Expo cleaner,which is the best of them all, don't be fooled by advertisements of others. There is NOTHING, NOTHING that will restore these boards to like new condition. The only thing that works and will last for 1 week is to first clean thoroughly with Expo, then with as hot as you can stand it(without burning your hands of course) just plain water. After cleaning with water, dry with paper towels, making sure there are no water spots (water spots attract and keep the dust) Other than that....buy new boards.
Removing pages from a spiral notebook
You could try running a blade (knife, scissors, etc) along the spiral binding to make the break more consistent. This will leave the paper withing the small binding portion largely intact.The problem as I see it, is that the paper tears in different directions. Sometimes an individual ring of the binding will tear through the paper leaving the paper on the full sheet. Other times it tears between two of the binding openings leaving the paper inside of the spiral. Since cutting to the edge of the paper from each individual binding would be tedious and still likely require trimming the final sheet, cutting in the other direction will be quicker and easier.So you'd cut through all the binding holes leaving a strip within the binding (easily removed in one piece from an end of the binding). The rest of the sheet will need trimming to appear neat, but the result is that there are no small loose pieces to appear messy or linger among the pages/binding of the spiral.
Removing pages from a spiral notebook
I just cut the pages off of the spiral binding with scissors, maybe 10 pages at a time. The scissor-cut edge of the page may be a little jagged, but for me it never matters.A similar approach would be to use a utility knife, and just cut through a lot of pages at once. You'll need to draw the utility knife's razor blade along the same cut several times to make it through all the pages.
Removing pages from a spiral notebook
Many spiral notebooks (like the one I use every day) have Perforations all down the side along the spine. However that would still leave you with a 1cm(ish) line of paper remaining down the spiral.However if you do not want that or your notepad doesn't have the Perforations, you can use a small blade and run it across the holes where the spiral goes through. That would allow you to remove almost all of the page in one go, and then simply pull the paper which is inside the spiral out. That shouldn't make much mess at all since if you cut down every hole, the entire side in the spiral should pull out in one go.

How to remove foot stink?
Although you can't wash your sandals and feet in the restroom at work, you could bring a container of pre-moistened towelettes into a bathroom stall with you and wipe your feet & sandals clean there.  Then you could either flush the towelettes (if the package says they're safe to flush), or bring them out discretely and throw them away.
How to remove foot stink?
Something I do when normal stink removal methods aren't working for me, such as spending extra time cleaning my feet and using foot powder in my shoes to dry them and absorb odors, is to clean my feet after my shower with rubbing alcohol. After you dry your feet, just get a corner of a rag wet with the isopropyl alcohol and scrub your feet, Especially between the toes, and let them air dry. If that method doesn't work when done at home, you could bring the alcohol and rag to work with you, or even just keep them there. Hope this helps. 
clean Off! bug spray stain on car's handle?
If the plastic is black, there are special car detailing (cleaning) products which remove white haze from the black plastic. Your local car shop will probably stock some. Stick with reputable brands like Meguiars, Autoglym, etc. The cheaper ones tend not to last, and the "stain" comes back after the product eventually washes off. Try Autoglym Bumper & Trim Gel, Meguiar’s Ultimate Black Plastic Restorer etc.You can also ask your local car repair shop, or look up a local car detailer and ask them what they use.I have tried other home remedies on occasion but they don't last, and can even make the problem worse once the "quick fix" is gone/washed off e.g. orange oil

Opening a box without a knife
Push in on the point where the side of the box meets the top.  This should create a gap between the tape and the box large enough for you to stick your finger in.  Then you can grab the tape and peel it off.  This won't work as well if the contents inside the box are stiff or if there is tape across the whole edge, but the idea is the same.Apply force in the direction and location of the beautiful arrows.

How to seal envelopes without licking
To expand on the "wet sponge / cloth / finger concept":As we are dealing with multiple envelopes, I recommend layering the flaps of the envelopes, slightly staggered, so that the sticky parts of the flap form a coherent area, looking somewhat like '>>>>'.Then use your preferred method of moistening (I recommend a damp sponge) to wet the seal in one go and close one envelope after another.Instead of folding down each flap, I recommend you grab the envelope at the rectangular part, pull it away from the rest of the sticky pile and fold it up towards the flap, so that the front of the envelope is on top again. It's one smooth movement without the risk of paper cuts (edge of the flap!) or sticky fingers.(Source: Helping with business mass mailings as kid.)

What's the easiest way to wash a bowling ball microfiber rag?
The easiest way? Throw it in a normal washer with your other laundry. Air dry to finish. Don't use any sort of fabric softener.If you can't/don't want to put it with your normal laundry, wash it in the sink with warm water and some mild detergent. Again, air dry.Basically, you won't hurt your towel unless you really do something to mess it up.See a discussion here.

How to prevent clothes from shrinking in the washing machine
Generally speaking, natural fibers, such as cotton and wool, tend to shrink, industrial ones don't.Go one size up when you buy cloths which are made out of cotton or wool, or a material mix with a high percentage of natural fibers.If you have the problem with cloths at home and you can't exchenage them for bigger ones at the store:Don't use a dryer but a drying rack ANDstretch the cloths by hand while they are wet. However, this will only help til the next wash.

I always take a deep breath and try to hold it for as long as I can, sometimes I need to try 2 or 3 times before it works, but it always eventually does (usually on first or second try).I learned this method from the water drinking trick (To gulp down water till you gotta breathe) I use this because I don't always have water on hand.
Is there a way to erase pencil without a standard eraser?
I see that you are an artist so I'm gonna give you a really neat trick, although using it would mean ditching pencils and paying a little extra for your supplies (but worth it!). It's a matter of supplies but you can get pens with ink that is (very) easily erased by heat. The pens in question (or the only brand I'm aware of anyhow) is called Frixion made by a company called Pilot (So Pilot Frixion pens) these pens cost about 3$ a piece (6$ for two pack) and they come in various different types (Fine, extra fine, ballpoint, point, highlight, LX (luxury), etc) and they erase at around 60°C(140°F) and then they can also reappear at around -10°C(14°F) If you apply it right you can use it to deliberately erase and even undo your erasing without ever damaging the paper in the slightest. You can "burst" erase an area with a butane lighter then for erasing details you can use a wax sculpting pen. You can see it all in action in my source video.This might not exactly answer the question for erasing pencil marks without an eraser, but it does provide a completely alternative method. Using this method there are many other ways to get by as well (while un-erasing can pretty much only be achieved via a freezer, erasing can be achieved with all kinds of things around the house, electric heaters or your stovetop for example, a hot running lightbulb, maybe even toss it in the microwave oven to completely wipe it all!)So I guess this is a way around the problem ever happening, then again the trade-off is that you have to trade your pencil drawing techniques for pen drawing techniques which always end up depending on more than one type of pen (whereas with pencil drawing techniques you can always make do with just one pencil and go all the way with your drawings)Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BS7_-xelCs
How to remove ballpoint-ink on a card?
Erasing pen ink from papers is a difficult process, especially if you don't want to damage the paper in the process, in your case the cards also have printed ink on them besides your own ballpoint pen ink so basically what you're asking for is next to impossible without damaging the ink on the card as well.However there is an alternative, which would be to grab another pen in a color matching the background and draw over your original pen lines. This works for hiding it, you will still of course see it, but only when you look close enough (i.e. if you get it right you can hold the card arms length from your face and you won't be able to tell).There are however inks which can easily be wiped off whatever they were used on without damaging anything (for example thermo-sensitive ink can be erased with heat or cold depending on which it was designed for; Pilot Frixion pens are one excellent example of this) so next time you want to put marks on something that you might regret later, make sure to think of this ahead of time.
How can I prevent the flame of a matchstick going out as I light a barbecue?
It's actually pretty simple, if the wind is blowing out your match, all you gotta do is block the wind with your own body.After the match is successfully lit, cover it from the wind with your free hand (e.g. hand that held the matchbox, put the matchbox away and now you have a free hand) to make sure it definitely won't get blown out, (i.e. this way you can turn your body freely while keeping your hand blocking the wind from blowing out your light)Then light that grill up!Tip: Make sure to move relatively slowly (if you move the match too fast it'll die because fast movement essentially creates wind)

Sharing grocery costs and responsibility
Simple way to deal with the cupboard inventory: if you use something and there isn't enough to last until the shopping trip after next, write it on a list (kept in a designated location -- a magnetic pad on the fridge works well, if there's a pen attached).  Take the list on each shopping trip.Your method of splitting costs is a pretty good one; another is to have a "grocery jar" with money in it, and always put equal amounts in (for instance, both drop in a $20 bill -- at the same time helps avoid disputes over who did or didn't pay up), then take the contents to shop with.  This latter could also be done with a prepaid debit card, though that has some associated expenses and "who has the card" issues...
There is a tiny plastic ball stuck in my Macbook's earphone port. How can i remove it?
So, the toothpick is now glued into the port, locking the ball in?  I think you're to the point of needing a technician.  This would be a major operation on most laptops, but with the proprietary parts Apple loves to use in Mac systems, just getting a replacement socket that will fit (both the space and the solder pads) may be a challenge -- plus the point from comments, that soldering on the system board is a high risk operation.Take the computer to the Apple Store and let their techs deal with it.  At least that way, your warranty will be preserved after the repair.
Sharing grocery costs and responsibility
Something I've been doing for 30 years...Plan your menus weekly, so you know pretty much what you'll be eating each day, & therefore its components. Plan on eating things with the shortest use-by dates early & the longest dates later in the week.Check what you have in storage - cupboard/fridge/freezer & list what's missing; we use AnyList for iPhone & Mac, sharable lists so both can see what's on it at any given time. There are many alternatives.Buy for the entire week, one day a week - say Saturday morning - & split the bill. Most supermarkets can split the total over two cards.If you pre-plan so you don't run out of things mid-week, then you don't need any sort of 'cookie-jar' system at all.

There is a tiny plastic ball stuck in my Macbook's earphone port. How can i remove it?
The headphone jack is metal, while the ball is softer plastic.  The following may work:Find a very tiny drill bit that can slide easily inside headphone jack.Wrap a piece of Scotch tape around the bit next to the tip, leaving the tip exposed.Hold the bit with your fingers (not a power drill!!), and slide it into the headphone jack. The Scotch tape around the bit should protect the inside of the jack, but the exposed tip should be able to grind away at the ball.Rotate the bit back and forth with your fingers, apply a little bit of pressure. The plastic ball should "erode" into smaller bits of plastic. I imagine you'll be able to tell when it's gone, or you could pull out the bit every few rotations to check on your progress.When you're done, you can tip up the computer to dump out some of the plastic shavings, and clean out the rest using compressed air or a wooden toothpick.Note to electronics experts: If this is a terrible idea because it will ruin the jack despite the Scotch tape around the bit, and I get enough comments and thumbs down, I'll remove this answer.
There is a tiny plastic ball stuck in my Macbook's earphone port. How can i remove it?
While researching more on SO, I found the following image on this thread. There are 2 possibilities :The plastic ball's diameter is bigger than the end of the tube and it is stuck before the point where the tube gets narrow (at point just before 404).The diameter of the ball is small and it has reached the end of the tube (in the narrower region, marked by right red arrow).(To determine the case, then you can try shaking your laptop and holding it close to your ears. If you can hear a slight sound, then it's probably case 2, else its stuck at case 1.You said you tried with a toothpick and glue, and it didn't work. This suggests that it might be the second case.)In both cases however, you can take a needle and try to poke and break the ball into pieces. Broken pieces might fallout then.Precaution : This might damage the internals of your laptop. Proceed at your own risk.
Sharing grocery costs and responsibility
Keeping a track of inventory is a tough job. One way to not over stock is to check the cupboards before going to buy groceries. Splitting expenses is easy. Me and my team at office use an amazing app called Splitwise. The app shows how much you have spend and how much do other members owe to you.(Note : I'm not related to splitwise in any way, except for being a user.)
How to keep my shoes dry and smell-free when I'm living in a tent for 2 months?
Put rice in a pair of socks, then put the socks in the boots when not in use. rice will absorb the moisture. The reason feet and shoes smell is due to bacteria, if you reduce the moisture content of the boots then they will smell less. You could go down the route of antibacterial spray like they use in bowling allies but keeping them dryish should do.

How to stick slivers of soap together to form a large bar of soap
Some types of soap are more malleable than others. One method is to soak them and press them together with your bare hands. For harder types of soap, let the soap sit on a damp washcloth or sponge for a few hours, then using a toothpick or some other pointed object, score the surface of the soap, then press them together. This is really similiar to attaching a piece of clay to another.Another method to combine small pieces of soap is to cut them into small pieces, heat them up in a microwave, then let that sit for a week or so. For more details go to this instructable on how to recycle soap Hope this helps!

How do I remove the chewing gum stuck in my shoe?
A chewing/bubble gum is always a mess when it sticks to an object (shoe, cloth, etc)My answer will add two ways after freezing and ice cubes: 1. FreezerPut the shoe in a plastic bag. Wrap the bag tightly against the shoe and close the bag well. Put the shoe into the freezer for about one hour. When you take the shoe out of the bag, you will see that the gum is stuck to the bag.2. Ice cubes Put the shoe in a plastic bag with ice cubes. Make sure the ice cubes only touch the soles or the heels, or you may damage the shoe. Press the bag so that the ice cubes press against the gum. Hold it there for a while, so the ice cubes freeze the gum. When the gum is frozen, remove it with a knife.3. WD-40Spray the gum with WD-40 and wait one minute. The gum should come off with a paper towel 4. Peanut butterApply a thick layer of creamy peanut butter to the gum. Leave the peanut butter in place for about 10 minutes. Rub a wire brush over the area to remove the gum. The peanut butter will pull the gum off along with it. When it's gone, clean the sole of the shoe with water I love peanut butter, and would consider last possible approach.I have followed this referenceStay gum-free, stay clean

There is a tiny plastic ball stuck in my Macbook's earphone port. How can i remove it?
Use tweezers (the sharp type of tweezers used for soldering or medicine) I know you tried toothpicks but tweezers are different! tweezers always save me in these kind of situations! specially considering they don't break, be careful not to push the ball further however!alternatively, use a stronger glue and a tooth pick, insert it while its wet and pull it after letting it dry overnight! do all of these on your own risk!you can also insert a hot pin if it's a plastic ball but I wouldn't as you have to be insanely careful! but you can apply some hot air with hair drier to change it's shape!

Smoke smell in my house
Few things worked... Hope it would work for you as well. I am a non-smoker, but  I still couldn't catch it. I suppose the owner has sprayed some room freshener when I visited them...I moved into a room that was used by a smoker... I didn't feel the smoke when I initially did the inspection.. but as I started to stay - I felt the smoke.. I think you have a similar issue.. on speaking to my mother and sister they suggest me following tips.Keep all your door and windows open, so that air can flow through.. this will reduce the smoke smell.When door and windows are closed - like night time - Get vinegar in a big bowl and keep in the middle of the room - whole night, as the smell of vinegar will remove the smoke.Rub parts of the mirror / closet - and the other parts with baking soda solution ( baking soda dissolved in water). Spray the solution on carpet and tiles and wooden parts- and floors where you feel - the smoke might have settled- this will remove the smoke.Get some diffuser and essential oils - Eucalyptus in your room and use it in your house.. this will remove the smell and may keep you calm.Hope this helps.
Smoke smell in my house
If it's tobacco smoke from long-term use, it's not easy to eliminate. The stench adheres to every surface, particularly painted walls and carpeted floor. You might need to try all of these:Change furnace filters, and, if possible, clean the furnace ducts (if forced-hot-air heating is used).Wash all walls, ceilings, counter-tops and hard (wood, vinyl, tile) flooring with detergent that is safe for the wall and floor surfaces.Wash carpeting with a commercial carpet cleaner (often called "steam" cleaners, though no steam is actually generated). These can be rented from hardware stores, tool rentals and even some supermarkets.If the house was furnished, clean furniture with a mild cleaner such as Murphy's Oil Soap.If the smell persists, you may need to repaint and/or recarpet.You might check with an attorney (solicitor) for legal advice... part or all of the cost might be borne by the seller or agent.

What can be used besides rice to keep moisture out of salt?
My first salt grinder, a Peugeot, clogged up just a few weeks after purchase. It still had the salt that came with the grinder. I placed it in a narrow cup-like plastic container, not much wider than the grinder itself and inside the container I placed a couple of unopened sachets of silica gel. It seems to have cleared out the clogging to a large extent.I suppose you could also fill such a narrow container with some rice and store the mill in it. The rice/silica gel gets to do its work effectively because it's right next to the grinder mechanism and there's no chance of getting any in your food.
There is a tiny plastic ball stuck in my Macbook's earphone port. How can i remove it?
Use a pin/needle. On the laptop, mark the depth of the socket. Use e.g. some adhesive tape (painter's masking tape), line up the edge of the tape with the end of the socket. This way you can see how far you can insert your pin without hitting the end of the socket. The adhesive tape can be removed afterwards. Check how far you can insert the pin.Heat the pin. You can use a soldering iron, or your gas range. Use pliers to hold the pin.Insert the pin into the ball. With any luck, the plastic will soften, and your pin will be embedded in the ball. If it doesn't work, the ball is made of a thermo-hardening plastic.Wait for the pin to cool down and the plastic to solidify. Withdraw the pin, hopefully with the ball attached. 
How do I run Windows OS virtually instead of on a PC?
You're looking for an RDP client.You do need to have a host system somewhere that has access to the internet. The following instructions from the MS support site detail how to setup an account for remote connections:Open System by clicking the Start button Start button icon,  right-clicking Computer, and then clicking Properties.      Click Remote settings.  If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation. Under Remote Desktop,select one of the three options.      Click Select Users.If you're an administrator on the computer, your current user account will automatically be added to the list of remote users andyou can skip the next two steps.      In the Remote Desktop Users dialog box, click Add.      In the Select Users or Groups dialog box, do the following:          To specify the search location, click Locations, and then select the location you want to search.          In Enter the object names to select, type the name of the user that you want to add, and then click OK.          The name will be displayed in the list of users in the Remote Desktop Users dialog box. Click OK, and then click OK again.https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17463/windows-7-connect-to-another-computer-remote-desktop-connectionSince you mentioned not needing to buy a Windows connection, you'd have to use a cloud service like AWS. If you follow the following instructions, you will create an "EC2" instance:Creating your own AMI with the right configOn AWS, create a new EC2 instance. Use defaults everywhere except as mentioned below:*Base image should be Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base (since Windows still has all the best games)*Windows Server 2012 R2*Select an instance with the hardware configuration that closest matches your needs.*Use a Spot instance, it’s significantly cheaper (fractions the regular cost) than regular instances. Note cost will vary depending on  region. I usually bid a penny more.*For the storage step, leave everything at the defaults. This will provision a 35GB EBS drive where your OS will live, and a 65GB  SSD-backed instance-store (which is super fast and where the games  will go). This instance-store will be available as a Z:\ drive.*For the Security Group, I’d recommend creating one that has 3 rules: one that allows All TCP, one that allows All UDP and one that  allows All ICMP. Source should be from Anywhere for all 3. Yes, its  not maximum security, but with the VPNs you’ll be setting up, it’ll be  very convenient.*Finally, for the Key Pair, create a new one since you’ll need one for Windows (to retrieve the Administrator password later)Once your machine has spun up, get the Windows password using your private key. Connect via Microsoft Remote Desktop and add the  details in there. Also make sure to select Connect to admin session to  avoid GPU detection troubles.

Smoke smell in my house
You could try placing a few bowls of regular, white vinegar around. Although this is typically used to get rid of paint smell, it may work on smoke as well. Some other things you may try are crushed charcoal, strong air fresheners, or baking soda. Baking soda is often used to absorb refrigerator smells and hence may be a bit more versatile. Charcoal may be a pretty good avenue to try as well. Because it absorbs and traps smells (it does the same with poisons, when someone is given charcoal as an antidote).Also, burning a strongly scented candle will likely help, at least for a time. These two websites are where I got most of my information. Remove paint smell - VisiHow and Get rid of tobacco smell - WikiHow.
How to remove dust from tiny holes in mobile device?
The other end of the vacuum may work too -- the exhaust port (rather than the suction end). It functions almost the same as a compressed air canister.
How to remove dust from tiny holes in mobile device?
Use a soft toothbrush thin enough to get inside the holes marked followed by a vacuum pipe sucking all the dust out of those tiny holes.Soft toothbrush will disturb the dust and break the binding or reduces the binding. And applying suction from a vacuum cleaner just after that will remove most of the dust from it. Note: this will not be 100% clean as it is achieved by opening the parts and cleaning.Thanks for bringing this up.Stay clean, stay good..!
How can I remove scraps of food from books?

Heat water in two buckets using one immersion rod
Two buckets, two siphons full of water, one situated at the top of each bucket, and one situated on the bottom of each bucket insulated. put the heater in one of the buckets. As water is heated, it rises to both buckets because of the upper siphon that is full of water, and is replaced by colder water from both buckets because of the siphon connection at the bottom of both buckets, thereby heating both buckets at the same time, no connections, no leaks. Be sure to place the heater away from the siphon so that no bubbles get in the hose and break the siphon.
How to wake up without waking up other people in the same room

Heat water in two buckets using one immersion rod
Place the two buckets next to each other. Take a length of copper wire, wrap this around the heating element several times. Remove the coil you've made from the heating element.Wrap the other end of the copper wire around the heating element several times. Keep enough space between the two coils that you can dip one coil (on the heating element) in one bucket, and the other coil in the second bucket. Repeat step 2 and 3 several times, so you end up with several coils of wire on the heating element, and several wires going from one bucket to the other. The more the better (increased heat transfer).Of course, all proposed solutions ignore that it's much easier to heat one bucket, then the other. You spend far more time jury-rigging the buckets than you save by heating them at the same time. And if you're going to buy copper wire, it's probably cheaper to buy a 20-litre bucket instead.

Once i used a a heated pin to remove the tip of an RGB cable, pin or needle or anything equivalentit pierced through it like butter ( luckily it was plastic ) and i waited for it to harden again and it just stuck to the pin and i just pulled it easily.maybe use something to stabilize the pin ,for safety , because you'll be shaking (at least i do) like through a hole in a piece of paper. like in billiard or something.Sorry for any poor phrasing or misexplanation
How to stick slivers of soap together to form a large bar of soap
For what it's worth, here's what I've been doing successfully for the past several years.1.  Take your slivers and put them thru a salad shooter or grater to make flakes. 2.  Cut the bottom 2 inches out of a plastic bottle - I use this as a mold. I recommend a polypropylene or polyethylene bottle, not a clear bottle from other materials. 3.  Fill your mold with the soap chips. Add water up to about 1/2 inch from the top.  Put it on a microwave safe plate, and put in the microwave.  Turn on the microwave for 15 seconds at a time --- keep an eye on your mold - when the soap begins to bubble and rise, stop the microwave and let it settle down.  Keep repeating this until the soap has become real mushy.4. Take out your mold and using a spoon tamp the soap down and smooth off the top.   Put it in a dry place and let it sit for a week or so.  Then, squeeze the sides of the mold and slowly remove the cake of soap. It will still be soft, so let it sit out in the air for another week or so until it hardens.5.  When it's hard, it's ready to use.  I make one cake at a time-  when I begin using one, I start another so it's dry and hard by the time the first one is just a sliver.  I have a supply of soap chips I made by grating all the hotel bar soap I collected when I was traveling at work, to which I've added all the slivers in the house which I'd been saving so I have a generous supply available.  
There is a tiny plastic ball stuck in my Macbook's earphone port. How can i remove it?
I think the best advice is you find a jeweler.  If that is not possible, I would go to a hobby store and get a pin vice and very fine drill bits(about the size of a pencil led).  The pin vice is made to hold very small drill bits and pins that you can twist by hand.  Make a small hole in the ball but not all the way thru(use the advice above to judge the depth you need to drill). Then take a tapered screw that will fit in the audio jack and is long enough to screw into the ball and twist it into the ball.  With any luck you should be able to then remove the ball.  Good luck.
How to stick slivers of soap together to form a large bar of soap
Just put the soap slivers in a sock and use it like soap-on-a-rope.For example In the US we have a problem holding on to soap in the shower and would rather not bend over to retrieve a dropped bar (mainly in a public shower!) so we put a leash on our soap to keep it handy. Check out this link for an example: Wednesday Wisdom – Soap on a Rope.
How can I remove scraps of food from books?
Just tap the book on the table a few times then dust off anything that remains with the nearest napkin (or blow on it with the built-in can of compressed air in your chest). Another thing you could try is not eating over top of your books. I read while I eat too and I put the book off to the side. Food doesn't fly over there unless I eat like a wild animal.If you're eating exceptionally messy food, like a rack of BBQ ribs, or a whole turkey leg, or spaghetti with your hands, or live squirrels, just don't read while you eat (or accept that you'll trash what you're reading).You could also save up and buy a Kindle or something.And I hate to point out the obvious but if you find using a pencil leaves pencil marks, try something pointy that isn't a pencil... I mean, it shouldn't be a surprise to you that your pencil is working as designed and drawing lines...

Though I agree with @Kevin C. Jones answer, an alternative "armor" is commercially available: split loom, which is simply tubing slit along its length that may be slipped over the cable. If you have some plastic tubing, you can slit it to make your own. When doing so, you might find a diagonal split, forming a spiral, easier to apply and less prone to falling off.

Keeping cats out of an area
A lot of people in my area fill old plastic bottles with water and position them around their gardens or driveways. The reflection of light on the bottles filled with water seems to deter cats from encroaching on their land.We don't want to leave plastic bottles lying around so we keep a super-soaker handy so when we see an offender approaching we can fire a warning shot or two to frighten the cats away.I'm not a lover of cats but it is important not to harm them, simply scare them away so they find an area to do their business that's less hassle for them!

Slowdown digestion for a 30 hour journey?
Use of a fast-acting laxative about twelve hours before your journey starts will help empty the colon.  Once this is done, you won't need to "go" for twenty-four or so hours, until your colon is refilled by normal digestion.  Combined with avoiding food during the journey and eating light, low-fiber foods for your last two meals before travel, this is likely to be all you need.
How to stop bed from squeaking
This depends on where the squeeks are.if they are in the frame, tighten the joints, put a rubber washer between the metals being joined together. If you dont have a washer or cant adjust the bolts then lubracate the joint, normal cooking oil works, just put a little on and then make it squeek to try to get the oil to the squeek.if it is in the springs, this is a bit harder. the easiest way is to get a board to go on top of them. but some people like the springs and this turns the bed into a non sprung bed. Otherwise find the bit that squeeks and either lubricate or replace.

How to straighten board game board?
A steam iron (for clothing) should do the job.  To avoid marring the board pieces, be sure the iron has never had impure water in the steam passages (distilled or filtered water is recommended).  For each piece to flatten, place it printed side down on a piece of olefin (Tyvek or non-adhesive Pellon), and steam the back side evenly, then hold the iron (without steam) on the piece until it stops steaming.  Remove the iron, and place the board piece under a weight (heavy books work well) on a flat surface until completely cool and dry.That should fix you up.
How to get rid of pantry moths?
To get rid of a pantry moth infestation is:Remove the moths, their larva, and their eggs.Prevent them to come back.The first step you already succeeded by throwing away all possibly infected food, seal their hiding places, and prevent them to mate by setting up pheromone traps to catch all males.Things to considerreally, really be generous in throwing away all food if you want to be sure. Moth eggs are too small for our eyes to see.  Store food you want to keep i nthe freezer (this will kill the eggs).clean all and everything from cans to cupboard to remove all possible eggs.  We will not get rid of 100% of all moths. They hide in the weirdest places (I found them sitiing in my kitchen radio) but if you catch all males in the traps then after all their life cycles went through they will not be able to spawn. Make sure to set up fresh pheromone traps regularly.Now here is the harder bit. We don't want them back. Moths will enter your clean kitchen from the outside, from your neighbours cupboards, or from litter bins around your flat. Little we can do here. But quite often we will find that food from one supermarket is much more affected than from another. Therefore:change your grocery storewatch out for infected food before you buy it (webbing often is the clue)store food that often harboured moths in the past in the freezer (it was the ground almonds for me).always store all food in air-tight containers after you had opened the packaging.Still, when living in a city they will come back sooner or later. Get used to set up traps from early spring to late autumn.
How to clean out a pencil sharpener
I assume you mean a conventional compact manually-operated prism sharpener like this:Thanks Asim18 at Wikipedia!To remove anything lodged between the blade and casing, use a thin metal instrument (like the tip of a mechanical pencil, or back of a hobby knife).  Put it in the slit between the blade and casing, and use it to push stuff out toward the opening. To remove any left-over dirt inside the cone, put a piece of tissue or toilet paper over the end of a pencil, and "sharpen" it anti-clockwise (the opposite direction compared to the usual sharpening motion, to avoid tearing the tissue).  If the dirt is sticky (e.g. some fool tried to sharpen an oil-based crayon), try isopropanol.

A little dab will do you.

How to get rid of ants
I have always used ant poison like nipon which the ants will take back to the nest and it will kill the queen. This is not a fast solution but given time works well.
How to get rid of ants
This really really depends what type of ant. Most you can just keep spraying til they give up, die off or decide somewhere else is more profitable.Destroying their pheromone paths will prevent hungry returnees. Killing them in your house will prevent them returning to the nest to set a pheromone path to your comestibles.Things which are smelly &/or sticky make good path-breakers. Vaseline they will not cross even though they can still smell the other side of the path. Hairspray works for a day, then loses its potency. Lighter fluid washes the path away, but doesn't prevent their return & is also a bit flammable ;)Pharoah ants, on the other hand, can only be killed by feeding them with a hormone which prevents their breeding. If you try to kill/spray/squish pharaohs, they go into 'under attack' mode & all turn into breeding females & dissipate - not what you want - you will end up with tiny nest sites everywhere.[This, strangely is not borne out by the wikipedia link - but was what I was told by the exterminator who came to rescue us from an invasion we were unable to deal with ourselves after 6 months of poisoning & the methods described above, which have been pretty successful on every other ant-type. It may have just been a poor or misinterpreted version of the 'budding' which that page does discuss - nevertheless, pharaohs need specific pharaoh 'poison'.]

Rain Jacket losing waterproof ability
In my experience, the spray-on products I've tried only worked for one shower of rain and then the jacket went back to allowing water to seep through. However, I have also tried the products that you wash into the jacket, after washing with a special detergent, and the re-waterproofing lasted much longer (about a year). I made sure to remove all traces of washing powder from the washing machine first, by removing and cleaning the drawer.
How to increase shoe size
There are many types of shoe stretchers from ~US$5 to ~US$20. There are videos demonstrating the use of the stretcher.Also try thinner socks and, if you've added a cushion insole, remove it.Finally, check your weight. Some people periodically gain and lose weight, sometimes due to water retention. This might be normal for you, or it could indicate a medical problem.
How to increase shoe size
DrMoishe's answer (i.e. use a stretcher) is correct, but I'll just add one twist to it that I got from my girlfriend that makes it free and more convenient.Pretty much every decent size mall has a shoe repair store (at least everyone I've been to). At these stores stretching is usually a free service that can be done within 15 minutes while you shop or wait.

How to use free electricity?
Any energy storage is going to require investment -- and the magnitude of the investment relative to the amount of energy you can store is why power utilities almost never attempt to store energy (as opposed to offering consumers incentives to use power when they have excess capacity, as they've done with you).Batteries aren't the only way, of course -- you can store energy by lifting weights, including pumping water into a high tank, and using the weights' fall later to generate power; by spinning up a large flywheel to very high speed, and using the flywheel to run a generator later, or by pressurizing a gas that will later be used to run a motor/generator.Of these, only lifting a weight (either a solid mass, or liquid) is reasonably obtainable without high-tech equipment, and reasonably efficient.  It will still require more investment per kilojoule (both in money and in time) than batteries and an electronic inverter to give AC output of the correct voltage.  Worth noting that nearly all UPS units can be upgraded by connecting larger batteries; deep cycle lead-acid batteries are currently the most cost-effective for this, and cost significantly less than a similar capacity in the gel-cell lead-acid batteries usually found inside a UPS.  You could also assemble your own such system from batteries, a charger, and an inverter, likely at lower cost than a UPS (because you're not paying for their automatic switch-over feature and hardware damage warranty).  Look at systems designed to use solar power with regular mains-powered appliances for building cues.
How to keep chairs from moving across the floor?
Buy duct tape that is the same color as the chair legs, and cut a small piece to put over each "foot" of each chair. This ought to increase friction with the floor and keep the chairs from sliding so easily.Note that the duct tape would need to be reapplied periodically, as the pieces you add will probably slide a bit due to use.(If it turns out that this solution isn't permanent enough, just peel off the duct tape and remove and residual adhesive from the chair feet using an inexpensive adhesive remover.)
Protecting cords against chewing pets?
The only way to guarantee that your pets won't damage the cords (or hurt themselves) is to make it impossible for them to access the cords.  You can do this by simply moving them behind a piece of furniture or running them along the top of a wall.For example, I keep my laptop charger plugged in behind my couch and have positioned the couch so that it's impossible for my dog to get behind.  When I need to use the charger I simply extend as much of the cord as I need and then return it to its home when I'm finished.  I do the same thing with tv/phone/etc. cords by hiding them behind other pieces of furniture.  For dogs specifically, if they are properly stimulated and have something better to chew on they will ignore the cords.  My dog loves Himalayan Dog Chews, Benebones, etc.Most natural or chemical repellents only work for a short period of time.  Chewing [on the cords] is intrinsically rewarding to dogs, so after a while they will be desensitized to whatever you're using to repel them.  If you're dead set on using some kind of repellent you can try diluting some hot sauce and spraying that on the cords — it will work better than the bitter apple spray everyone sells.  Whatever you do don't use Vicks Vapor Rub as camphor is toxic to dogs.

Cockroaches in a speaker cabinet
You can't totally confirm the non-existence of eggs without visually inspecting every part of the cabinets.While some recommend using an IGR (insect growth regulator) the simplest thing you can do it wait it out. According to this source, the eggs hatch in 24 to 38 days, reaching adulthood by 103 days on average. If you don't mind waiting a few months you will know for sure. Otherwise (if if more begin to appear), pursue the chemical route.
How to quickly "cool down" from exercise before work?
What you're observing is the temporary increase in metabolic rate that goes with any exercise.  This requires your body to get rid of the greater amount of heat it's generating, and it can generally only do this by sweating.  You won't stop sweating in this way until your metabolism returns to your normal level.One way to avoid sweating in the office is to build more time into your schedule between exercise and office -- end your workout an hour earlier, drink cool to very cold water afterward, and wait until your perspiration rate has dropped before showering -- and it goes without saying to shower in the coolest water that's comfortable, as hot water adds heat back to your body and promotes sweating.Another idea is to exercise in the evening instead of the morning -- then cool off and shower before bed.  This will also save time in the morning, letting a slightly later bedtime compensate for the time you spend in the gym, cool down, and shower.
How to increase shoe size

How to get rid of pantry moths?
We have had excellent results with using one of those ultra-violet electronic fly-killers (usually seen in cafes, etc).  After cleaning out the pantry and ditching bags and paper containers (plus any contaminated tins) we installed one of these, it's now been there for a couple of years and we NEVER have moths (except the occasional night moth or fly).  Electricity usage is negligible, and a quick whizz with the vacuum cleaner every few weeks clears up the beastie bodies.  We also have a similar gadget installed in the kitchen, paid for themselves many times over.
How to stay at the bottom at a swimmingpool
Paparazzi's suggestion from comments, to dive with a weight (not bound to your body, for safety reasons -- the weight should drop away when you straighten to push off for the surface, at the least) that will overcome your natural buoyancy.  You'll need to experiment to see how much weight is needed.A milk jug or similar, partially filled with sand and then topped up with water to eliminate air, is a good adjustable weight (more sand makes it heavier under water, but the water portion is weightless when submerged).  You can also tie a rope on the handle with a float on the other end, to make it easy to retrieve the weight from the bottom of the pool.  Most "normal" people will require between 5 and 10 kg of sand, perhaps less if the weight is iron (like a weight plate from a barbell set) or lead (like scuba divers' weights).Very Important!!  Never do this without a "buddy", someone who can push the weight off you and assist you to the surface if you go over your allotted solving time -- if you lose consciousness underwater, alone, you will die.
How to get rid of ants
I had a problem with ants for a while, and you can do one of two things.Put baking soda near doors or anywhere you think the ants might be getting in.Poison the anthill.
How can I remove large amounts of duct tape from a door?
Heat the tape and use a paint scraper or try to peel it off the door, if that does not work, then pour hot water and try then.Also, if there is some of the glue left on the door, take another strip of tape and repeatedly put it on the area with the residue and then take it off again.
How can I reattach to the Ziplock bag its slider that separated?
First of all, buy a new one, they are cheap. If you really don't want to, then pinch the two ends of the bag together and slide them on, i'm not sure if this works all the time but I used this method a few times and it worked for me.
How to "recharge" sodium acetate hand warmer without a stove?
I have put a hand warmer in my tea mug and used the Hot water feature on the tap that is connected to the coffee maker and it took about 12 minutes if I poured the hot water over the bag while it was in the cup and then put the lid on.  Worked fantastic, was warm from that for almost an hour and then activated it after that again.
How to "recharge" sodium acetate hand warmer without a stove?
You could make a stove out of some candles, find something to hold a bowl above them, fill the bowl with hot/boiling water and that should fix your problem.
How can I prevent mattress protectors from being removed in rented properties
For something like this you can use a curved needle to stitch the protector onto the bottom of the mattress. You additionally stitch something in that says removal of the mattress protector will affect the return of the tenants security deposit. You shouldn't need to stitch all the away around, just maybe around the corners and middle of the sides. This will effectively prevent removal. When you want to remove it, a few minutes with a seam ripper will make short work of it.
How to use free electricity?
Only being once a week is pretty limiting. Energy storage is not impossible, but it is impractical because the cost is too high- for example, the Tesla Powerwall would save a couple dollars worth per week, but costs $3K, so it would never pay for itself. An electric car would have similar economics. Most big energy consumers in a home can't be time shifted easily (A/C, fridges, freezers, hair dryers, kettles) or don't use much value of electricity. I suggest looking at vampire consumption such as TV set top boxes and AC adapters that are not plugged into anything, that can be turned off when not in use. This is not shifting, it's simple conservation. Anything that is warm all the time when you touch it is sucking juice continuously. You can buy products that will show the consumption of appliances such as the Kill-a-Watt. Some homes have dozens or scores of such adapters continuously powered. 
How to remove build up of biofilm within pipes
The best thing to do is to remove the trap on your sink (it needs cleaned at LEAST once a year very well to keep things 'moving well') and then use a pair of gripping hemostats to poke up in the pipe, grab the hair (if there is any) and yank it out gently.I just did this recently with our main bathroom's sink that had been giving us trouble for nearly a year.You would not believe the GUNK that came out of it after putting numerous sinkfuls of near boiling water in it into the bucket I put under the steel sink pipe.Surprisingly the spare bathroom that I use the most when I took the trap out and looked up in the steel pipe coming from the sink to the plastic trap? Whistle clean almost, I just had to rinse it out with hot water and our kitchen sinks sprayer.Strange thing was the extremely hairy (literally) clog that was hanging on the pull-switch for the drain stopper. LONG LONG hairs. I'm talking 6 inches long at least. Even my mother does not let her hair get that long so I was going "Where the heck did this come from?"Clog was so bad that the trap was nearly fully occluded and it was a wonder that anything could get through it.
How to get rid of bad odour coming out of a water bottle?
Not really a hack.   Clean with soap and water.   Leave it open and let it dry thoroughly.
How to get rid of bad odour coming out of a water bottle?
In addition to Paparazzi's obvious but necessary "clean them in warm soapy water" periodically...We get the same thing with re-usable SodaStream bottles which are only ever plain water, fizzed.  If you have a smell that still hangs around after washing properly, then try filling with a solution of Bicarbonate of Soda & let stand overnight. Leave the lid off, it can be a bit fizzy.Then, to prevent it in the first place, always leave the lid off once it's empty.   Lid off allows the bottle to dry out between uses. You don't really want stagnant water sitting around for too long.
How can I prevent mattress protectors from being removed in rented properties
If people are removing them, consider the reason they do so. Some mattress protectors are annoying because they are not breathable and because they make noise as the slumberer moves.Get a better quality protector, or cover the protector with a second fitted sheet to make it less noisy and more absorbent of perspiration.
How do you stop headphone wires from breaking?
The best method I've thought of requires a bit of hot glue to stiffen the end of the cable, and some heatshrink tube in the color of choice. First apply a thin layer of glue at the end, from wire onto connector ~2mm. Then push the heatshrink (which should be 2-3cm / 1 inch) over the glued part, and carefully heat it until it fits perfectly. 
How to empty a sponge of its soap?
Garden hose with a nozzle. (if the sponge will hold up to the nozzle)It is probably easier to have a dedicated rinse sponge.
How to empty a sponge of its soap?
I sometimes set the sponge in the sink directly under the faucet, turn the water on, and leave it for a few minutes.  All that water running through the sponge will wash out anything that isn't water (except for crumbs & particles that are wedged in, but that's not the issue here).  The sponge may need to be repositioned under the running water once or twice, depending on the shape & size of the sponge and the size of the stream of water.After a few minutes, you just wring the rest of the water out of the sponge and you're done.
Best way to remove "wound closure" tape that is taped to some of my eyebrow?
I have always used baby oil for removing adhesive bandages. It eliminates the adhesive like magic. However, I've never used it on that particular kind of tape, so you should try it out first. Get some more of the tape, if you can, and experiment first on another part of your body (like your forearm, especially if you have hair there so it is similar to your eyebrow).
How to make sure that only paying customers use my 3D archery course?
From your description, the only remotely cost-effective way to ensure only paying shooters can use the course is to enlist technology.  There'll be a significant investment up front, of course.One way (not the only one, just one that came to me immediately) would be to use a vending machine to issue an RFID bracelet or tag with payment, then have targets activated by reading the RFID.  This will require a computer to control the targets, actuators for each target (to rise up or move into view), RFID readers at each shooting station, and wiring the course to connect everything (or installing wireless equipment, likely somewhat cheaper to install and much cheaper to maintain).  For safety and tracking, you could also use RFID activated gates to enter and leave the course -- activation of the exit gate would replace the sign out list now in use.  As a safety bonus, the computer could include a function to notify someone (the course operators or rescue authorities) if a shooter doesn't leave the course in some reasonable time longer than the normal time to walk and shoot the course -- and, of course, once the RFID has been used to exit the course, the managing computer would disallow that same RFID tag from using the course again (though if desired, the course management could also issue "season tickets" or "lifetime memberships" that are issued from special blocks of RFID tags).Of course, this depends on having a fence around the course, but you need that anyway, for safety of non-shooters.Once the initial investment is paid, maintenance costs will almost certainly be much less than paying a wage to a gate guard, and you can likely increase the course fee for the "pop-up targets" -- targets could, for instance, be on a delay after the RFID is read, could "run" or "walk" across an opening in cover, etc., which would be attractive for sport shooters.
How to help an office coffee 'club' succeed?
I ran one in my last office but went with a pay to drink system.  When there is a requirement of bring your own to share with everyone mentality, it usually doesn't succeed because others start to become aware of who isn't contributing.My suggestion to you would be to require people to pay.  Figure out:how many people will be part of ithow much people drinkhow many K-cups are needed to sustain the needtrack in a spreadsheet that can be viewed be everyonerequire payment by XXXX dateWhen people realize how much they will be saving, it usually goes quite well.  I charged $5 a month for each person (about eight people).  The cost of going to a chain at about $3-$4 a cup adds up.
How to help an office coffee 'club' succeed?
I have a coffee machine that uses "pods" and we have an honesty box for the cost of each pod. This may not be able to be done in other workplaces as we have a company culture that makes honesty boxes less of a risk, there is over £20 in the honesty box at times.
How to help an office coffee 'club' succeed?
In the next department to ours there is a Cafe X (X is the nickname of a guy who founded it and then later died of cancer). It has been going for 30 years. There are two machines. People put marks on a list when they take a cup. They are expected to refill machines when empty and so on. In general this works fine - people do restart the machines, they do mark the list. Cafe X never makes a loss, and if they make a profit they reduce the price for a while. Since X died other people take turns to do the shopping and keep the kitty.Maybe it works so well because they still remember X, who was a really nice guy, and everyone knows they don't make a profit.
How to prevent feet from getting sore after standing all day long
Besides changing posture as much as possible (fairly obvious and I imagine you want more specific advice), there's a great trick to rest your feet and legs throughout the week: when you sleep, put your feet up on a pillow. The rest you get every night will really make a difference during the day.
How to prevent feet from getting sore after standing all day long
Stretch your legs.  Some of the sore or tired feeling in your feet comes from the muscles in your feet moving to compensate for inflexibility in your legs, specifically your shins and achilles tendon.  Alternate pointing your toes down and pulling your toes up, several times a day.
How to clean my iron so that it won't leave brown spots on my clothes?
The brown coming out with the steam is mainly due to rust in the steam passages.  Given the price of a new iron, the sensible way to deal with it is to replace the iron and use only distilled or reverse osmosis filtered water in the new one, to prevent recurrence.If that's not a viable option for some reason, it might be possible to soak the iron's steam system with a rust remover.  I think it's unlikely you'll find anything that will take rust out of the steam passages that won't itself stain clothes.  Mechanical cleaning would require something similar to a pipe cleaner, but thin enough to push through the steam passages (which are far from straight, to hold the water inside the sole plate as it heats and boils).Another option (one we used when I was a child, forty-plus years ago) is to keep the iron dry, but spray a light mist of water directly on the clothing as you iron.  You can use tap water for this in most locales, because the solids in the water won't get concentrated by repeated boiling in the iron's sole plate (but test first on a piece that's already got stains; if you have high iron content in your water this can also cause problems).  This last also works with a dry iron (one without steam passages), which is how I recommend using it if you decide to replace the iron.
How to help an office coffee 'club' succeed?
If someone wants to make coffee, they use their own K cup.They can keep a box of their favorite in their desk or bring in a K cup in their pocket every day.  If they forget to bring one in, they can ask a friend to sell them one.
How to clean my iron so that it won't leave brown spots on my clothes?
You can prevent (slow down) deposits by using distilled or reverse osmosis water.You don't have a clean button but I would try using the steam button as a clean button.  Fill it up, heat to max, unplug, take it to the sink, and hold the steam button util it empties.  It may not empty but worth a try.
How to empty a sponge of its soap?
I always squish the sponge as good as I can while holding it under running water. Then after I squished it hard enough I resale it and let it soak as much water as possible. I usually repeat the steps 3-4 times and then the sponge will be soap free.
How to empty a sponge of its soap?
Use less soap.Most of us use far more soap than is necessary.  You don't need extravagant lather to clean something.
How to maximize total apple/pear volume in a space limited bag?
Considering that in a bag of those dimensions & taking the individual objects' sizes into consideration, that there will only probably be one piece of fruit difference in an optimal vs non-optimal filling, & the fact that you don't have time/inclination to keep replacing items until fully satisfied, you have to my mind only two potential methods...Choose smaller fruit. The gaps will be smaller, more randomness is possible & pure luck could find the right gap in the bag to get that one last piece in.Like settling a box containing flour or cereal, which is much easier to visualise, the item size being much much smaller & the settling therefore more obvious - shake it or bang it [gently] against a horizontal surface.This will give the items a rough chance to naturally find their own best levels.... a late 3... do 1. a few times on separate visits with clearly differing sizes. some same, large or small, some mixed weights & see which comes out heaviest when you get home.  To really be sure you're onto a winner, you'd have to weigh the cores afterwards too, & subtract from the arrival weight.No good if you can get 3kg in the bag, only to find later that 2.5k of "better" sizes would produce less waste overall
How to remove ice formation inside the car windows
I had this issue with my 2006 Tundra and its sunroof.  The sunroof sealing system is designed with  passive drainage and the weep holes can get plugged up, which allows water to overflow/seep inside the cab. Use an air hose to blow out weep/drain holes in corners when sunroof is in open position.  Also, close heater vents to "recirculate" option when weather is both sunny (warm) and rainy/cold, which can cause a condensation situation. The recirculate setting shuts down the outside airflow into the cab.
How can I wear my headset and glasses in a way that doesn't hurt?

How to maximize total apple/pear volume in a space limited bag?
Choosing all large or all small fruit does not change the packing density. But if you choose some large fruit, with some smaller pieces that fit in the interstices amongst the larger, you can increase the density. See Wikipedia on sphere packing.

How to use the end of a squeezy tube?
Step 1: Ensure you have all the product squeezed into the "forbidden" part of the tube.Step 2: Fold the empty tail in half, then in half again, and again -- you might, with a very thin tube, get a fourth fold, but at the end of this, the empty part of the tube should be very short and very tightly folded.Step 3: Hold the folded empty tail with a chip clip or similar device.  Steps 2 and 3 are to prevent product returning to the empty tail of the tube during step 4.Step 4: Hold the tube nozzle between two fingers on your stronger hand, and push your thumb into the flattened part of the tube material.  You should fairly easily be able to squeeze more product out of the nozzle -- and do this several times.I've used this technique at work to get the last 3-4 tablespoons of grease out of a squeeze tube before discarding it and getting another; if you have strong enough hands, it works very well, but there will always be a small amount of product you can't extract, short of cutting open the tube and removing it with a spoon-like tool.  Another answer suggests combining the leftover contents of multiple tubes into a single one, cut right at the tail; you might then be able to heat-seal the tail of the refilled tube with a soldering iron or hot glue gun tip.  This is still an option after using the "thumb and fingers" extraction method above.  This method could also be used to load a large syringe with a cap in place of a needle (these are sold in hobby shops to apply glue, or in machinist hobby suppliers for grease).Another option might be to search for another product equivalent to this one, but packaged to reduce waste -- for instance, in a tube with a softer top, or even in a (recyclable, we hope) metallic tube, where you can crush the top of the tube to recover the last of the product.

How to remove rust from tools
I obtained a great collection of hand tools from a retired car mechanic. Ratchets, sockets, swivel sockets, pry bars with ratchet adapters, extensions, impact sockets, wrenches, screwdrivers, etc. A number of them snap-on and craftsmans, prontos, Napa, etc. Most had medium rust, some heavy rust. Because of the sheer volume of tools I didn't use evaporust, etc, due to the cost. The best and most cost effective method was white vinegar and then 1 cup of baking soda per gallon of water. Let the tools soak, completely covered, in the white vinegar. 24 hours if not too bad, 48 or even 72 if very bad. Then scrub with brass wire toothbrush. Pull and Dip in water to rinse then into baking soda paste. 5 or 10 minutes. Pull and scrub with 0000 steel wool. Wipe down with rag soaked in mineral oil. Coat with coconut oil or a corrosion proofing spray.
How to deep-wash a backpack?
I will address mainly the smell part. This will probably wash out the food spills as well.The key here is that the smell comes from cooking and stays for a long time in your bag. It suggests that oil with plenty of cooking flavours that is dispersed as tiny particles in your flat when you cook meet your bag and stick to the fabric.Since the dirt is oily, and the oil may have become very viscous with time, I suggest that you prewash the bag in warm water with dish washing liquid. Then rinse, and put on a regular washing machine cycle. Such bags resist washing well. Maybe just avoid spin-drying too fast, as some parts of the bag may contain cotton stuffing that could move around too much.
The smell of metal (mainly brass)
Brass musical instruments are coated with clear lacquer to prevent contact with skin acids from corroding the metal -- and it's corrosion products left on your skin that you're smelling.  You should be able to eliminate the smell on your hands by thoroughly cleaning the brass on the top (soft scouring powder such as Bon Ami, a careful rinse, followed by rubbing alcohol or acetone to degrease the metal should be a good method), followed by coating the brass parts with clear nail polish.This is likely to require occasional reapplication, as the lacquer will wear off due to contact and handling.  When reapplying, use acetone to remove the old nail lacquer before repeating all three cleaning steps.
How to catch a loose parakeet without running him down?
You are in luck.  I had some wild parakeets that would fly around the house.  Wait until night, then kill the lights in the house.  Grab em with a hand towel, if they are good biters.  If they are not, bare handed grab 'em.  Parakeets will not move if there is no light.  They cannot see as good as human's either.  You don't need a flashlight, just very little light in the room is enough.

How to stay at the bottom at a swimmingpool
NOTE: This all depends on how long you can hold your breath.When a rocket launches, the force from the bottom of the rocket, in kids words, "fire", pushes the rocket up in simple means. However, if the pressure was coming from the TOP of the rocket, the rocket will go down instead of up.Now, take a very deep breath and jump into the pool. As soon as your nose goes underwater start breathing out. This is similar to the example I gave you earlier, it's like the pressure making the rocket fly, but instead the air is pushing you down. Now, you'll start going back up. When that happens start moving your arms in a way that it looks like you're "pushing the water. You can stay down for a while, but this all matters on how long you can hold your breath.

How to make a big decision, then have it stick?
Something I was once taught on how to make a decision, mainly of preference, but without sufficient information to decide on any logical basis.Toss a coin.  The traditional method; assign one outcome to heads, the other to tails (this works best with a dichotomy, but you could do the same thing with multiple options and the right kind of dice), then give the coin a nice, high toss.By the time it comes down, you'll know what you were hoping it would show, and that's your choice.For sticking with it, from there, it's just a matter of reminding yourself as needed that this is what you wanted to do.  If it really is what you wanted, you'll find it easier to stick with it because you know that.
How to reattach headphone cables that have separated
I use tape. It works fine, just not very attractive. A little stiffening of the wire is not a problem and the tape reinforces connection between the broken parts. 
How to keep food fresh without a refrigerator
If you want long-term preservation, then some traditional methods work well:Dehydration - Dried apple rings, apricots and banana chips are some examples.Osmosis - Add enough sugar or salt and spoilage organisms grow slowly. Jams, jellies, marmalades and other preserves rely on this principle.Blanching - Quick-cooking just enough to delay enzymatic and bacterial degradation. Look online (e.g. Mother Earth News) for more ideas.
How to reattach headphone cables that have separated
If the connector is not too large, you can use heatshrink sleeve. You need a sleeve with a diameter large enough that you can slide it over the connector, and small enough that it will be a tight fit on the cable when you shrink it.  Cut a short section (1-2 cm), place it at the point where you want the cable to come together, and heat the sleeve to shrink it.For best results, do this as soon as you notice the cables have started to separate. If a long section of cable has separated, you'd need a long section of heatshrink sleeve, and it's too stiff for that to be a usable solution.  Nondestructive heating is not possible in my experience. Gluing it depends on the exact type of plastic used as insulation: you need a glue that will weld the plastic. Anything else will be too brittle. 
How to keep food fresh without a refrigerator
Since most food goes bad because of bacterial growth, exposing the food to UV light is often used as an alternative to thermal treatments (freezing/cooking).https://www.reference.com/science/uv-light-bulbs-inhibit-bacterial-growth-a6c35dcc8c74e449Also, putting meat in an enclosed space that has salt blocks for dry-aging works. Rather than salting the meat directly, which changes the flavor, the salt blocks affect the air in an enclosed space and bacteria growth is hindered allowing the meat to age with minimal bacterial decomposition while allowing the natural enzymes to break down and tenderize the meat.(plenty of google references for this technique)

You can try to tape the wires for every 10 centimeters or so. This also solves the problem of stiffening of wire, to some extent. But, be sure to choose tape with very low width.
How to keep food fresh without a refrigerator
My answer is based on the assumption that you are looking for an alternative refrigerator which does not require electricity.Use can use Pot-in-pot refrigerator.A pot-in-pot refrigerator is an evaporative cooling refrigeration device which does not use electricity. It uses a porous outer earthenware pot, lined with wet sand, contains an inner pot (which can be glazed to prevent penetration by the liquid) within which the food is placed - the evaporation of the outer liquid draws heat from the inner pot. The device can be used to cool any substance. This simple technology requires only a flow of relatively dry air and a source of water.Alternatively, you can put the vegetables in steel utensil and cover  the whole utensil with clean wet cloth. However, this alternate solution does not cool better than Pot-in-pot refrigerator.
How to rid steelware of metallic taste
A bit of a late answer but after researching this a tad myself I may have a bit of relevant data and conjecture to contribute in the case that anyone may see this topic as well and desire a way to rid their cutlery of the metallic taste. I found an article in a similar discussion online: http://www.ttl.fi/en/publications/Electronic_publications/Documents/Stainless_steel.pdfOn page 21 it references how chromium and nickel can leach out of stainless steel and mentions that the amount will decrease after each use. I believe if this is true the cutlery at your work may have been fairly new and will lose that taste over time once it is used washed and so on. Applying what I know of chemistry you may be able to speed up that process if you apply heat to speed the reaction or use acids to help strip away surface impurities faster. I have yet to try this, but if anyone feels like running an experiment try soaking the cutlery for a day or two in a mild acid such as vinegar or soda or submerge it in water and let it boil for a decent while, wash it, and then see if there is a noticeable change in the bad taste. It might not be a quick enough fix you could use at work during lunch break, but could help anyone who bought cutlery and can not stand the metallic taste.

How to separate plastic grocery bags?
If I'm in the produce section, I touch a piece of wet produce to moisten my finger tips and open the produce bag. If I'm checking out, I either touch some moist produce in my cart, or hold a small section of the bag opening area taunt and wiggle it back and forth until that section becomes separated. I then blow on it; creating a small opening to work with. I have also used the "pull the handles apart" method. If I cannot get the bag open, I go for the paper bags.

How do I get rid of smoke smell
I agree with @Ron that you need to seal the wall to prevent further smoke infiltration.But you already have a noticeable odor - in order to do something about that, you need to do 2 things:1) Air out the space.  Leave the garage door open as much as possible.  If there's a way to run a fan so it pushes air through and out the garage, do so - open a window in the house, open the garage door, put a box fan in the door between the garage and the house.2) Clean and deodorize what's in the garage.  The inside of your car, anything you store in the garage, etc.

Take a rounded spoon of peanut butter and swallow it all down.  Don't rush the process as the consistency is quite thick.  Do this multiple times ( I usually do it twice with large tea spoons ) and you will generally get great results. It's been my go to for hiccups for years now.
Want to replace a friends license plate
You can't make your own license plate. You can order a replacement plate, or switch to a vanity plate, but only for your own car. You could try to do it for your friend, and pay, but you would have to pretend you were your friend, it would probably be delivered to your friend's house, and you might be committing some sort of fraud.
Want to replace a friends license plate
While you can't legally replace the damaged plate with a custom made one, or (most likely) order a replacement from New York aside from just paying your friend's cost to do so, it's most likely possible to straighten the existing plate enough that the damage won't be noticeable, because license plates are made of soft aluminum.First, the plate needs to be off the car.  Then you can use basic tools (or even your hands) to take out the main bend and a hammer and punch on the back side to undo creasing at the embossed areas.  Be very careful not to damage the paint or reflective coating (do the punch work on a surface padded with a folded towel or similar), or the plate may become non-compliant with legal requirements and force replacement.If you try to do this, you'll want to make sure it's okay with your friend; taking the plate off his car without his permission might qualify as theft, leaving you in the position to wind up making plates for your own state (in prison).
How to quickly cure hiccups
Hiccups can be caused by many reasons as other posters may say. One of them is stress/jitters.I had an extremely strong hiccup attack a few months ago, one that I am glad no one but me had the bad luck of watching. It would not stop by any means I found on the internet but a very strange one:Watch closely the pointer of a clock for a period of one to two minutes, concentrating solely on the seconds pointer, trying to count how many hiccups you have. The result is that you can't count more than 3 hiccups, because they suddenly stop.I am pretty sure there is a scientific explanation of why this happens, but it did work for me, and for some other people. Though my source is only a blog, and it is in portuguese, it's where I got the tip, and some other users claimed this technique to work for them too.I did it as a last resort, unbelieving that it would work, but it did. Later during the same day, the hiccups came back again, and I stop them by using the same technique, so it worked twice for me.
How to clean cloth-wire earphones?
You could gently dab the cloth part of the wire with a damp kitchen towel, and rub a little bit if there are stains/dirt. Otherwise, I don't know if there is much else you can do to clean them, particularly in terms of the wires...
Rain Jacket losing waterproof ability
To increase the longevity of the water resistance, avoid using fabric softener in the wash or the drier with the item.  I got that tip from an insider at lululemon.
How to reduce noise disturbance?
"Reasonable quality and intensity" would not disturb your neighbors. When you play your beautiful music through the walls it becomes noise!You could try fiber egg cartons (if you like eggs), attach to the walls with that poster tape that doesn't leave a residue (can't remember the name).They have been used in radio and recording studios to reduce echo, not sure they would reduce high-volume low frequencies very well though. Or buy a house with a basement... :>)
Cockroaches in a speaker cabinet
Rubbing alcohol (isopropyl) in a spray bottle will kill roaches, spiders, etc., then it evaporates leaving no smell or residual poison. You would have to open the speakers and spray any bugs or eggs, but it would beat smelling bug spray! Probably don't want to spray the speaker material or foam.

All you need is a glass or cup and a piece of paper.  Trap the spider in the glass against the wall, then slide the paper between the wall and the lip of the glass, fully covering the mouth of the glass.  Place your hand over the paper to keep the glass sealed, then dispose of the spider in whichever way you wish.  Down the toilet, out the door, you choose!

Kill Tiny Spider Without Contact
They're probably clover mites. They are usually found outdoors, eating plants. They also hang out in grass. New edit I re-read this and realized I didn't really answer your question. These little buggers are pretty resistant to most pesticides (pesticides are bad anyway), but you get them off plants by spraying with dishwashing liquid mixed with water, or hot sauce and water, or essential oils and water. Someone mentioned spraying them with alcohol, so you could go with that. It sounds like you have a lot of them, so you'd have to spray a lot. Also, you can prevent them from getting in your house by caulking, sealing, etc.
How to clean cloth-wire earphones?
Because wiring is involved (though it's a very low voltage), you may want to head over to the Electrical Engineering board; they're very helpful. Okay, this is what I would do... Use a black permanent marker to color the cloth part. Use one of the big ones, because it will be much easier, and faster, and you'll probably have to go over it to catch the missed spots. A permanent marker dries very quickly, so don't "soak" the cloth, better to let it dry. I've done this on clothing, like jeans, that have accidentally been splashed by bleach. I'm not sure what kind of wiring runs through the cloth covering (maybe loose, most likely covered in plastic), but it shouldn't hurt them. Again, check with the EE people if you're uncomfortable with this. As far as where the wire meets the white plastic, you could put tape over that part, though the absorbancy of the cloth will probably make the marker migrate just to that point, when you get closer to the ends. This looks like nylon cord, which I've "markered" to use for wrapping gifts. The cord looks fine to me, so I probably wouldn't do anything. If I did color it, it would be in purple, because I'm from New Orleans, and we're crazy down here. :)
New trainers - leaky sole!
In the short term, you can use sealskinz waterproof socks. It might be worth it to try to determine if it is indeed the sole or perhaps the upper. I would start with a plastic bag to block water passing through the insole. If your sock gets wet, your problem is the upper; if it stays dry while the insole gets get wet - you guessed it - it's the sole.
How to stop scratching my eyes
I would still suggest that you see a doctor for professional advice on the issueBathe the area in warm or cold water - I sometimes get really itchy eyes so opt for putting them under running cold water to try and relieve some of the irritation. Experiment with both cold and warm water to see what works for you bestCover the area - If you are unable to stop the urge to scratch, then you can just employ a physical barrier to completely stop you from being able to scratch. Unless of course you just remove said barrier to get the itchy goodness but then you must really love to scratchPut pressure on it - Sometimes I just find the most simple thing is to put a deal of pressure on it either by sitting on (if possible) or laying on it. This is usually the most effective for me personally so it might work for you too.
How to stop scratching my eyes
I recently received a diagnosis of Keratoconus after a visit to the opticians caused the automated machines to return a reading far from my actual prescription.On visiting the consultant, he checked the inside of my eyelids and noticed a redness that indicated an allergic inflammation which causes my to regularly rub my eyes.  The mechanical action of my rubbing my eyes over a number of years is what he believes has led to the shape of my cornea to change.He prescribed me some eyedrops which are intended to prevent the allergic reaction of the inside of my eyelids which in turn reduces my need to rub my eyes.  It's early days yet and I have an appointment in summer 2017 to assess how successful this has been but it may very well be that you are suffering from something similar.Your vision is too important to mess about with so I'd be inclined to suggest you speak to an optician about this as a priority.  It could very well be nothing but it's worth getting checked out ASAP.
How do I get the last lines of dust into the dustpan?
Just keep sweeping the remaining line into the dustpan. It'll shrink more and more each time you sweep it, until in the end there's nothing left of it.It also helps to change the angle of sweeping each time; that way, what was a long line becomes a shorter line relative to the new angle of direction.
How do I get the last lines of dust into the dustpan?
This is a widely known lifehack. Use masking tape - just tape the front of the dustpan to the floor. It should cover the gap between the floor and your dustpan.(Image taken from this Reddit thread.)
Is there any hack I can use to prevent having to clean my gas stove so often?
Not really a hack but effective. A splatter guard does not prevent shallow-fry of food with high heat and a fair amount of oil.  Water moiture can still escape and most of the fat splatters are caught.Also a cone silicone product.
Is there any hack I can use to prevent having to clean my gas stove so often?
Some people use aluminium foil to cover the gas stove. This way, you can remove it every 7-15 days and you won't have to clean that much. It might be a bit tricky to put the foil the first times, but it gets easier with time and practice
New trainers - leaky sole!
The correct answer is to take them back for a refund. They're unfit for the purpose for which they were sold.Failing that, contact the manufacture and get them to repair / replace the shoes.Anything else you do to fix the problem is likely to make it impossible to return them.
How to keep sticky notes from falling down?
I can't believe that nobody has posted this yet...First, one thing I've been told is to not pull sticky notes upwards or sideways. Doing so causes them to bend, which allows grime to get between the sticky surface and whatever surface it's attached to. That obviously reduces its ability to stick to a surface.Instead, prepare the note (write or draw whatever you want on it) first, then lift it slightly from the bottom (the edge opposite to the sticky edge), place a finger underneath it to hold the remaining ones in place, and pull straight toward you. Place it flat against the surface you want it to adhere to (after cleaning the surface, if necessary), and gently flatten it against the surface.If that is not sufficient, while this latter is admittedly not a life hack, you should consider purchasing "super-sticky" sticky notes.
Does boiling tap water make it potable?
I'm not a biochemist or anything, but as far as I know, boiling water will kill any biological contaminants. There can still be remnants or byproducts from them left in the water though, in addition to chemicals, heavy metals, etc.You should filter first, then boil, if you can.  Ideally, distill it.As a general rule though, tap water should already be considered "potable" to begin with.  If your town/city has put you under a boiling notice, then the boiling should suffice.
Does boiling tap water make it potable?
Yes and no.Boiling water for a minimum time (I recall it as ten minutes, but I could be wrong) will destroy any biological pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites) in the water, but will not make the water chemically safe if it wasn't before boiling.  If you suspect your water is contaminated with toxic chemicals (lead, cadmium, perchlorates, petroleum seepage, etc.) you should use a suitable filtration system to remove the toxins.You may also want to boil the water if there's reason to suspect bioharzards, but most high quality filters will remove bacteria and parasites as well as dissolved chemicals.  Read the labels to be sure.
How do I get the last lines of dust into the dustpan?
I use a hand held vac on the small particles of dust that won't sweep up. My mother always dampened a paper towel and wiped up the dust that way. Either is logical and works perfectly.
How can I safely trim my fingernails without a fingernail clipper?
The simplest way to safely trim your fingernails without nail clippers is to use your eye teeth, fingers, and a rough surface.  While it sounds odd, this is how I have trimmed my finger nails for most of my life.  I do not do this for my toe nails.Please note that I leave a 2mm white section even when my nails are trimmed and trim them when then are around 5mm in length.I use my eye teeth (sorry canines) to pierce the nail on the side closest to the thumb.  I then use the thumb and index finger of the other hand to tear the nail off.  Due to the way nails grow, the tear naturally follows the same curved line parallel to the pink part.The resulting "cut" can have two issues: it can show a thinner paper like remnant or the "cut" is slightly rough (but has none of the sharp points I get when I use nail clippers on my smaller toes). Both of these wear off with normal use.  In grade school, I used to smooth them by drawing them against the edge of the thumb nail on the same hand. In college, I used a granite rock the same way. Now I use a nail file (doesn't feel good but works better).I don't know how well this will work for other people.  My nails are abnormally healthy, even, and thick and I have been doing this for a very long time. I do this in private (or more likely alone in my car) and don't tell people. Nevertheless, the end result have been complimented many times. I've been accused of getting manicures.
How do I get the last lines of dust into the dustpan?
Modern dustpans have evolved a compliant rubber lip that already assists with this task.Using a feathered bristle brush with light downward pressure also moves the dust sideways over the lip instead of down and under the lip.The bristle type I mean is illustrated in this car washing brush but common these days on those sold with dustpans as well.
Does boiling tap water make it potable?
OK, I'm going to go out on a limb here...To answer the question directly, the answer is an emphatic No.If there is something 'wrong' with the water to start with, then simple boiling in a kettle will not 'fix' it.It will not fix:-  Chemical contamination in any way, shape or form.  Biological contamination - though it will kill a lot of biological contamination it is not 100% certain.You can improve your chances by many methods, but not with only a kettle.Having said that,  if the water came straight from the tap in pretty much any "developed" country, then it's potable right out of the tap.if it came from a well, stream or lake, then you cannot guarantee it to be potable.Processes to 'clean' water, but require more than just a kettle:-Sterilisation does not remove chemical contaminationDistillation can remove some, but not all contaminants.Anything that will boil off at a lower temperature than the water will move across with it, unless you have a fractional still [far too much to explain here, but some general info].Reverse Osmosis - allowing 'pure' water to pass through a semi-permeable membrane; a very complex process not normally done as a single stage, but also employing additional chemical &/or bacterial filtration.
Does boiling tap water make it potable?
From this link to REIBoiling is not going to remove heavy metals or other toxic chemicals but a filter is also not effective against most heavy metals or toxic chemicals.Your stove, fuel and a pot are an effective treatment system to combat  the full spectrum of biological pathogens. Bring water to a rolling  boil for 1 minute; if you’re above 6,500 feet, boil it for 3 minutes.Pros:The only additional supply you need to pack along is extra fuel. Murky  water doesn’t impair effectiveness. Serves as a readily available  backup method in case your main filter breaks. Cons:Time and effort required to bring water to a boil. Wait time for the  water to cool. If it’s your primary treatment method, you need to pack  an extra fuel container.
Cleaning oil spill on a concrete floor
You can use an absorbent such as oil-driKitty litter is a decent absorbent  And over time it will evaporate  
How do I get the last lines of dust into the dustpan?
Just blow it back around the floor and pretend it never happened.If a rug is available, traditionally you would sweep it under the rug.Explanation: if it's not enough dust to sweep up it's not enough to care about.I don't have any citations for this. It's a technique I came up with myself and I haven't documented it anywhere else. Maybe someone else has covered it, I can update if needed.
How can I avoid peeling my hangnails?
There are foul-tasting materials that can be applied to the nails to remind you to keep your hands from your mouth, or wear gloves.Even if it's just while you're home alone, wearing of gloves is a reminder that will help you to break the habit. BTW, I had a similar issue, but after a hand injury required bandages for a week, my bad habit was broken.
How do I get the last lines of dust into the dustpan?
move the dustpan backwards when sweeping the last few bits into it. I've done this for years and it helps greatly. 2-3 of those usually gets it all.
How can I avoid peeling my hangnails?
Try maintaining your skin too. Keep a 99 cent nail file on hand that you can use on callouses or rough skin near your cuticle. If you start picking, biting, etc. consciously smooth your skin with the file.
Does boiling tap water make it potable?
I've read that just boiling at atmospheric pressure is not sufficient to kill all bacteria - that's why we use pressure canners to raise the temperature of boiling enough that the canned food will not spoil.  Boiling at atmospheric pressure seems likely to kill MOST of the bacteria, though, and therefore make spoiling much slower.
How can I avoid peeling my hangnails?
If the skin is going to come off, it's definitely going to come off. Let it hold you for some more time. Forcing it to peel off definitely hurts the skin surrounding it. And also, biting our finger skin is unsafe as it may have numerous germs. Skin near our fingers are stressed when we do a lot of manual work, which partially blocks blood flow. One thing which helps me overcome biting skin near nails is to apply lubricants like oil or lotion.I am a drummer and I face the situation quite often. Using oil or moisturising creams to keep the skin active is what I follow and it really helps. 
Remove wet sand and mud from shoes

How do I fix poor sleeping habits?
I find staying up for 30-35 hours will help reset my body clock. I would not sleep one night then go to sleep a few hours before the time I want to reset my sleep time to. This then allows me to wake at a normal time and then sleep at a normal time again
How to clean the charging port of iPhone 6?
I normally clean charging ports using a straightened paper clip (best results with classic metal ones that do not have a plastic paint cover). I found they scratch the inside of a port much more effectively than toothpicks (resulting in dragging more of the stuff out).More resistant/stuck lint can be removed if you can bend the last few mm of the clip with pliers a bit. If you have problems with bending a clip, try a sewing pin instead. They're thinner and more easily bendable.Of course, turn off the phone (remove battery if possible) to make sure you don't short-circuit anything.
What household substitutes are there for cotton buds?
Unwind a paper clip. Bend it in half - the point is to get a loop that's much narrower than an original clip. If a paper clip is not available, try any other wire of similar hardness and thickness.Wrap the bent end with regular cotton wool (if not available, substitute with a piece of soft toilet paper or paper hand towel).Two things to be careful of:The wrapper material should be in one piece (best to try and hold a small scrap of it with one finger while cleaning) to make sure no piece of it stays inside.Operate carefully with this improvised device so that you don't injure the ear canal.
Does boiling tap water make it potable?
If it is already drinking water, then chemically nothing needs doing to it as storing water wont affect it chemically. (assuming you are using glass or food safe plastic bottles.)Biologically, it depends on how long you want to store it for. If you want to store it for a few days, it should still be fine straight from the tap assuming that you are using a sterile bottle as any contamination will take time to grow. Any more than that I would treat the water after storage as you can not produce water bottled at home without any contamination.If you store the water in a cool and dark location this will decrease growth of any contaminants. Additionally the dark will reduce the degradation of plastic bottles.
What household substitutes are there for cotton buds?
I start with a facial tissue (Kleenex). I fold on corner over about half an inch, and then twist / roll that whole corner to a point. It doesn't damage your ear, there's nothing to get left behind, and it does a pretty good job of gently scratching your itch.
How to clean the charging port of iPhone 6?
I like to use compressed air and a tiny brush that came with an electric beard trimmer.  The brush is normally used to  to clean the shave head but it scrubs well in the usb ports too.  I'm sure an old toothbrush would work just as wellUse the little brush to knock loose dirt and grime then use the compressed air to blast it out!
How can I get single portion size amount of sprouts per day, with minimum attention?
This method takes about 20 minutes daily, if it's worth that to you. You can line a small tupperware container (or any other small container with a lid) with cheesecloth or similar. Each day, start a new one, with the desired amount of seeds for your needs.Twice a day, take them to the sink, open the containers (individually of course), and lift out the contents in the cheesecloth by the 4 corners, for rinsing. Rinse the container too. Then place them inside with just enough water that they remain damp, and replace the lid. You can do this in the morning and evening (handy if you work during the day), and have them sit on a counter (for green sprouts) or in the dark, like under the sink (for blanched sprouts).To streamline the system, you could invest in making or buying pouches of similar light material as cheesecloth. this will make lifting the seeds/sprouts easier, and also the transportation. 
How do I get the last lines of dust into the dustpan?
A sheet of paper can serve as a makeshift dustpan. Hold it in the middle on one of the long sides, giving it a slight crease with your thumb. When applied with gentle pressure, and at a rather steep angle, the leading edge should hold true to the floor.No other technique using a broom can get more dust into the 'pan' and less into the air.
How to open a door without it creaking?
Often, lifting up the door and pushing toward the hinges keeps the hinges from squeaking.
How do I get the last lines of dust into the dustpan?
As a computer guy, I realized that the remaining dust is an exponential problem. This realization would have been bad for a mathematician: It means that true cleanliness can only ever be approached, never reached. Alas, I am an engineer, and for me exponential decay is very good news. It means that I can get the amount down a lot with just a little persistence; and where a  mathematician only has an infinite featureless floor, I have djechlin's carpet which will take care of the rounding errors.The underlying observation was that even versus the end of the "shoveling-into-the-dust-pan-process", each sweep does move a certain fraction of the dust into the dust pan, which is of course the reason for exponential reduction.As an engineer I'm bound to link practice and math. On the practical side, the removed fraction can be increased by:Moving the dust pan an inch or two backward each time to expose any dust that got under the lip before, and to give the dust space to "jump up" a bit into the pan;tilting the pan forward a little so that the rubber lip is nestled better against the floor, leaving a smaller gap for dust to go into;sweeping in a more "upward" movement, rolling the hand brush around its handle axis.In this fashion I sweep half a dozen or a dozen times in quick succession, each time moving the pan back a little, each time catching another fraction of the remaining dust. The operation only takes a few seconds and needs maybe one or two feet of space. Because my floor is not featureless I can take advantage of seams and gaps where they are available.On the math side of engineering we can estimate the remaining amount of dust after n sweeps: Even if each sweep only removes 20% of the dust, i.e. 80% of the dust remain, then each three sweeps halve the remaining dust; 12 sweeps reduce it exponentially to 0.8^12 = 0.06, or 6%. That is often good enough to move on to djechlin's strategy ;-).
How do I get rid of smoke smell
A simple way to make smoke smell disappear:Take a wet towel, not too wet. Towel of this kind would be sufficient.Wave it around the garage and car. It will absorb all the smoke smell.After that you can use room freshener/perfume, which is optional though.
How to open a door without it creaking?
Use a lipsalve aka chapstick on the hinges, push it into the gaps between the two hinge leaves with your fingers. It also works on swinging shower screens. Oil runs out, lipsalve just stays put.  
How to clean the charging port of iPhone 6?
You can use blue tack to remove a lot of dirt. Just gently press it over the port and remove. Repeat this multiple times.Don't be tempted to jam the tack in to the port otherwise you'll end up with some stuck in there.
How to clean the charging port of iPhone 6?
When my ports were dirty on my iPhone 6 I unfolded a paper clip and attached a little cotton to it from a cosmetic cotton ball. Then I took 100% isopropyl alcohol and dampened my cotton with it which I then used to pull residue from my port. If some of the stickier stuff doesn't come out right away you can leave the damp swab in there for a few minutes and it will start to absorb/degrade the residue making it easier to remove, just make sure you are using 100% isopropyl alcohol or you might damage your phone.
Cleaning oil spill on a concrete floor
You could do what I do with oil spills in my garage by taking a match with a long stick and burning away the unwanted residue. However, do that with caution and ensure that you will not light anything else on fire while you are cleaning.
Rain Jacket losing waterproof ability
I usually spray down my jackets with outdoor Scotch Guard after they start absorbing water and I do not have any problems repelling water for many wash cycles thereafter. I have used the regular stuff before such as Scotch Guard designed for clothing, but it does not work as well and typically cost the same as the outdoor version of it.
What household substitutes are there for cotton buds?
I would recommend getting in there with a twisted baby wipe. It might feel awkward, however judging by how good those wipes work by removing gunk from my pugs flaps and ears I don't see why you would not get the same success using wipes in yours.
How to clean the charging port of iPhone 6?
Had this problem as well recently. I simply took a dental floss stick -   one with a pointed end, and thus then the connection "switched off". Is at the beginning perhaps a bit tricky. You should swap the stick from right to left and then again, in order to get all the dust.I have always tried again with compressed air cleaner, but has not really worked.
Cleaning oil spill on a concrete floor
I'm not sure how applicable this solution is to finished concrete (It depends on how polished your floor is I suppose), but an old solution can be found in this video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPnmJItZVUEEssentially, you take oil dry and spread it out over the stain, then you start to grind the absorbent into the concrete. In the video the guy used a brick, but I've always just put on my mowing shoes and went to town with my legs. In hindsight,  brick sounds easier, but then again, it may depend on how polished your floors are.
How can I avoid peeling my hangnails?
Just keep thinking about all of the gross germs that live on your fingers when you start to bite them. Unless you like being sick, you will probably want to stop.
How to clean the charging port of iPhone 6?
I take a strip of transparent tape and make a tight loop with the sticky side out.  Then I jam it in the port, twist it around, and pull out the dust.  No worries about scratching the terminals inside.  Repeat as necessary.  Usually on my first attempt, the loop is too wide to fit in the port.  So I end up folding it in half.  That also gives it some stiffness.This may seem smart, but what would be smarter (and what I am too lazy to do) is to find a way to cover up the Lightning port when you're not charging the phone.  
How to make a ball pen work on difficult paper?

Fix a broken loop on a car key
This happened to my thumb drive that I like to carry on my keychain.I used Velcro strips to affix it to my key fob.  Do you have something else on your keychain that you could attach the key to with Velcro?  If not, maybe you could add something flat to your keychain to stick the Velcro to.The adhesive on the Velcro is VERY tacky and the thumb drive has never even thought about coming off the key fob.
Fix a broken loop on a car key
There should be a screw under the emblem - though idk how replaceable that loop is once you get in. It looks like just a small bent piece of metal with an angle at one end & the loop at the other...though as it's bent rather than cast it might just take solder.picture from dhgate.comOr you can get 'blank' keys for 15 quid/bucks/shekels & just swap the guts over to the new one - exampleOr... looking at the lack of vital structure at that point, drill it & put a larger ring right through the entire case at approximately the point the loop hooked in; even leave the inner part of the loop for strength/wear resistance & file off the outer part.Late Edit: - I had another late idea - now you added further pics &  I've seen the loop isn't bent metal, but cast.  I just thought about what I have attached to my own key-ring. It's purely decorative, meant as a joke, but might hint in the right direction. A threaded 'eye' outside the housing, with two small square nuts inside, locked against each other.Sorry the picture isn't great... it's a bit small & it's dark in my workroom right now ;-)

Saves the risk of loosing your key again should the repaired one fail suddenly.An example case would be:   http://www.ebay.com/itm/Fits-for-Alfa-Romeo-Mito-Giulietta-GTO-159-3-BUTTON-REMOTE-KEY-FOB-CASE-BLADE-/222306027717?hash=item33c278c8c5:g:i3AAAOSw44BYHaBd&vxp=mtr
Fix a broken loop on a car key
Since you've already extracted the broken part, it would be best to replace it.I see 2 handy options:1) Superglue and sodaThis is pretty simple - you pour some soda on damaged place, add a drop of super-glue above. It instantly goes pretty deep to the soda. After it's solidified, you file off excesses.Material is pretty sturdy (good enough for fixing plastic stuff), can take any form and can be done with household stuff (if you have superglue, which is pretty handy in itself). If you are fashioning replacement for the broken part (instead of mending it), you could also reinforce it with a loop of wire, but that is more of a trouble.2) WireWith a pair of pliers and some wire you can fashion a replacement. On the upside, it would probably last more than plastic analog. However, that just means that wear would be transferred to its socket, which is plastic just as well (and several years down the road you'd have a glaring hole in that place). So if you go down that route I'd recommend adding some sort of soft washer - plastic, thin rubber, even cardboard or several layers of paper would do.Due to the same reason - wear transfer - while you could use soldering iron to apply wire patch to the broken loop (if the material melts, not burns), that wouldn't last.Get yourself some wire roughly around 1mm. (remains of a sparkler, or coil from used notebook or whatever) Thinner or thicker would do just fine, as long as you're able to work with it.Take a thin pencil, coil the wire tightly around it several times (coil should be as high as the loop, so 2-3mm), leaving several loose ends of couple cm at least. Pull the pencil out.Now, imagine you're tying a simple knot. Put one loose end of wire trough the loop. If you can, maybe do the same with another too. This is supposed to hold different turns of the coil together. Part of coil that is wrapped around is the part that will be facing outside.Then, squeeze the coil with pliers. This will make it thin enough to pass through the hole in keychain's body. If you stick a match / toothpick / q-tip middle in the coil, you can make sure that you don't accidently squish it flat. Or simply use the corner of your pliers.Now you just have to spend some more wire on the part that would anchor the ex-coil inside the keychain, and don't forget some sort of soft washer.If you find your wire breaking after you bend and un-bend it in the same place several times - heat it red in lighter's flame, this sort of resets the metal.

Fix a broken loop on a car key
If I wanted to avoid paying for a new case, I would probably try making a replacement for it from a cotter pin:You can usually buy a whole bag/case of assorted sizes at the local hardware store for a few bucks, which is good because you'll probably want some extras -- I'd mess up at least twice before I found a shape that worked. You'll also need a couple pairs of pliers to bend it into shape, and something to cut it short with.It looks like you've got enough space to route a cotter pin replacement further inside the case, making it very unlikely to break or slip out. Just make sure you wrap the end(s) with some electrical tape, so it doesn't short out or scratch the circuit board. I would also consider adding a dab of super glue or hot glue to keep it from jiggling around (once you've tested that it fits, of course).
How to write on a blackboard
Not really a hackA chalk holder
How to write on a blackboard
Most people use mere chalk pieces to write on a blackboard. If the chalk pieces are getting broken often, then either the chalk pieces are of not so good quality or the way you hold the chalk piece is not right. Chalk pieces are made up of ionic salt which is light and easily breakable and that is why we use it for writing on a rough surface.If you hold the chalk piece at its centre while writing, the chalk piece is definitely going to break because of the torque acting on it. I would suggest holding the chalk piece just as how you hold a pen or pencil while writing on a notebook. But experienced people hold at its neck, I.e., few millimeters away from the tip which may help you apply more strength resulting darker font. 
How to stop snow from sticking to the shovel
After 20 years of shoveling heavy wet snow here in Colorado, I have found one product that works great.I used Amsoil auto and motorcycle and 4cycle oil for years, and Amsoil sells a product called "Heavy Duty Metal Protector" or MPHD. It is meant as a motorcycle chain lube, but it really works on all types of snow shovels. It sprays on, and dries to a very durable wax like finish on metal and plastic shovels.In the fall I bring all 3 of my snow shovels inside and clean and dry them. I then spray a heavy coat of MPHD. In March, I may have to spray again lightly.The oil sprays like the dupont spray wear off the first time I use them.

How to reduce the noise from PC's fans?
First, check if the CPU usage is low. For that, press Ctrl+Shift+Esc and open Performance tab. You'll see a chart. Wait for a few minutes without using your PC (for instance without playing videos).If you see that the usage is high (25% or more), then something is using your CPU, which in turn leads to the fan noise. You'll then have to find what is using your machine and fixing it. IF you're unsure how to do it, SuperUser may be of a great help.If the usage stays low (1% to 5% with occasional short peaks at 50% is OK), then the problem is usually with the fan itself.In this case, you have to clean the fan with the help of a vacuum cleaner. Carefully extract the dust from the fan and the heatsink (the metal plate between the actual CPU and the fan). The fan may start to rotate very fast, which is normal.Hairs, fur and large chunks of dust may be impossible to remove with a vacuum cleaner: if those remain, try to carefully extract the remaining dust with an ear Q-tip.Proceed with caution:Unplug the PC before opening the case.Don't use anything which could conduct electricity (such as a screwdriver). Even unplugged, the PC uses battery power from a small battery on the motherboard, and a wrong contact could do a lot of damage.Never touch the motherboard. There are a lot of fragile components on it, and damaging them is relatively easy. This applies as well to other parts such as the GPU and the RAM.Try not to damage the blades of the fan: remember that fans are both precise and relatively fragile. While a slight contact between the vacuum cleaner and the blades shouldn't do anything harmful in general, there is still a risk to damage it.Don't shake or push or pull the heatsink. Doing this can damage the motherboard, and eventually the contacts between the CPU and the motherboard if the PC is old.Finally:Make sure you also clean the airflow holes of the PC case, which are usually found beneath the front panel, at the rear and on the side.Organize your cables. None of the cables should be near the fan: if there is a contact with the fan, it will make noise, and could potentially damage the fan and/or the CPU (because of the overheat). Cables shouldn't prevent the airflow inside the case.

How to cut a pill in half without a pill cutter?
The best way is just to create your own score. We have to halve potassium citrate tablets at my job, and they're far too big to fit into a splitter (they're effervescent tabs). The best method we've found is to use a scalpel, and create a thin score along the tablet, then put on gloves and break it by hand. To create the score, we just drag the scalpel in a straight line across the tablet once or twice. It works quite well. The score doesn't need to be deep; you just need to create a "guide" for the tablet to fracture along. Things to note:Obviously you will lose some drug when you score it. We use a scalpel that's incredibly thin and sharp so loss is minimal. This doesn't work well for small tablets, unless you have tiny hands (so your fingers can actually grip the tablet). For small tablets, the loss due to scoring will also be higher; relative to the size of the tablet. The makeup of the tablet will decide how well this works. Some tablets crumble if you look at them for too long. The force required to snap a tablet may cause it to just fall apart instead of breaking cleanly. You'll need to experiment a bit to figure out if this is a feasible method for the tablet in question. The OP specified non-perscription drugs, but I'll say it anyways to cover my butt: make sure the drug you're splitting can be safely split. Splitting tablets increases their surface area which affects absorption. Splitting can also affect absorption if the tablet is a long acting version. I work under the supervision of a pharmacist, but anyone doing this at home should learn about the drug prior to manipulating it. 
How to cut a pill in half without a pill cutter?
I would recommend a serrated knife.  "Saw" through the pill while apply pressure gently. It make take time, but the lack of pressure should prevent the pill from crumbling.Note that some pills are coated to protect you from the taste of the actual medicine.  Cutting a pill in half exposes the medicine inside, which may taste horrible!
How to keep sheets from tangling and staying wet in the dryer
We have a policy in our house to dry the sheets separately from everything else. In other words, we run a separate load for small items like the pillow cases, shirts, socks etc. We also open up the flat and fitted sheets before we put them in the dryer, rather than putting them in as a ball. We haven't had a "Hershey's Kiss" situation since we started doing this.
How to reduce the noise from PC's fans?
Generally you cannot do much with your current fans (unless they have some defect), I mean, they are generally noisy. But you can do a few changes:purchase SSD - completely noiseless. Even if not directly concerning fans, it does help in reducing overall noise. It also produces much less heat than an ordinary HHD and reduced the need of fan work to some extent;purchase special low-noise fans - some brands offer such and while not completely noiseless, the reduction of noise is tangible (speaking from first-hand experience).Another possible measure is to simply place the computer case as far as possible so that noise simply does not reach you. This would come at the expense and incovenience of extra long-cables.

How to clean white streaks on rubber of speaker cone?
Honestly, leave them alone & try not to do any further damage.Those "rubber bits" are the suspension mounts which allow the speakers to freely move the coils within the magnet frame.They are designed in such a way that the movement is only ever at exactly 90° to the housing.The tolerance on a speaker coil is measured in microns.Thumping the mounts around in some clumsy attempt to clean them is just going to distort the coils & ruin the speakers, permanently.Accept the visual appearance, don't ruin the speakers.
How to get rid of bad odour coming out of a water bottle?
What I have always done is once a month or so I rinse my water bottle with white vinegar then soap and water to get the vinegar smell out. The vinegar kills all those bacteria that sink into the small crevices that are too small for the human eye to see. It is also best to leave the lid off when you have finished drinking the water as to let the rest of the water evaporate and not become stagnant.

How does one efficiently clean-up loose hair strands from one's back after washing hair in the shower? Is there a gadget designed to help with this?
A much simpler and free way to remove those pesky hairs, is to wrap a towel around yourself so it is wrapped around your back, so that you are holding both ends of the towel in front of you, and the towel on your back. take one end of the towel that you are holding, and pull forward , let the other hand be pulled, but don't let go of either end of the towel. then repeat the motion with other hand so you feel the towel going side to side across your back. that should remove any stubborn hairs that are clinging on.

It comes in a yellow, blue, pink and purple. Get the yellow bottle. it is light in color. If it says dry clean only ,then put 1 tablespoon of fabric softener ans one tablespoon of water. and steam it into the tie.from a distance so it only gets damp from the steam, not soaked and wet.
How to write on a blackboard
I would suggest a hack that we use to present details on black board.Please dip the chalk in small quantity of water before use. At first, as you write, your writings will be in lighter shades, but within a short duration it will become brighter. In this hack, no external force is required, as here it expects only our normal writing force. Moreover, this writing will last long and you may need to apply some force while rubbing the contents on board away.

I would suggest you to use this hack:Use a small piece of waste cloth(should be clean and dried one)Dip it in a small quantity of oil (I prefer coconut oil, you may use cooing oil)Rub it on the surface having these marks. The marks will dissolve in oil, cloth absorbs this oil.The shiny appearance of surface can be left as such as it will not cause any problems.This shiny appearance can be resolved either by using hair dryer or by cleaning the surface again with a wet cloth.
How to reduce the noise from PC's fans?
If the fans aren't defective, try some double-sided tape between the fan and the mount. I've used that with some Deltas and it reduced the noise dramatically.This worked as Deltas are high-RPM, high-CFM fans. If there was any play between the fans and the mounts they would vibrate against the mount. If there wasn't any play, it would vibrate the box (in this case, an antminer). The tape dampened the vibration.
How do I get the last lines of dust into the dustpan?
Sand the edge of the dustpan down to a knife's edge.  Reason the the bigger stuff gets swept up and the fine dust doesn't, is the edge of the dustpan is dull and rounded.  You need to sand it down to a point so that it meets the floor like >← and not like )← As an added bonus, if you're ever attacked by burglars or isis or whatever while you're sweeping the floor, you can take out their carotid artery with your sharpened dustpan.   As an added added bonus (bonus x2), you'll be able to sweep up the entirety of your attacker's mess without leaving behind those annoying last few lines.

How to reduce the insulating effect of new socks by "breaking them in" more quickly?
Drying them stretched might work. Cut a feet shape in cardboard that is bigger than the sock and put the sock on it while it is wet. Drying in this condition should help loosen them.Disclaimer, I never tried it myself for socks. I'm just improvising a hack from an old hack I was using to have longer jeans, hanging them with bricks as I couldn't find jeans long enough for my thin waist.
Cleaning oil spill on a concrete floor
If you know someone working at a gaz station you could ask them some of their absorbent. You might also find this sort of thing in hardware shops... I always found it looked it paperish sand. This will suck up most of the spill in no time. Once you have have removed everything (do not use a vacuum, this could set it on fire), use dish soap to clean the rest.

How to clean white streaks on rubber of speaker cone?
If that rubber is starting to degrade to the point where its wearing off from cleaning it, or some mild cleaner or Armor-All is going to wreck the surrounds - you may be ready to replace the surrounds anywaysAs for the reactiveness of the coil/suspension mechanism of that type of speaker - the spider takes on most of the work, NOT the surround. The surround is just there to seal it up and let the speaker "float" in the middle.You can order parts and DIY the surround or bring it/ship it to a place to have someone else do it if you are not comfortable with that kind of thing. I used to replace surrounds amongst other repairs of speakers, amps and other audio/electronics equipment.TLDR; just clean it, if it gets wrecked it can be fixed.use oil or armor-all, Windex, diluted vinegar...whatever you do DO NOT use acetone - it WILL dissolve the rubber.
How to perfectly pick only one tissue paper from a tissue box?
The reason you are getting two tissues out instead of one is because the plastic lining that regulates the tissues leaving the box was damaged.

Is it possible to make stiff cables and wires flexible again?
Two cents worth on softening dried or stiff wire/cable insulation:First of all, a "one size fits all" approach will not work because different cables use different materials for insulation. Having said that, here are a few observations I've made over the years, along with a few tips that may help to soften cables:Wires can stiffen for reasons including and not limited to any combination of the following reasons:1) Certain types of plastics when brought into contact with certain types of oils, can result in the insulation stiffening in varying degrees that in some cases will leave the plastic so brittle that it will become extremely hard and brittle, and will crack if the cable is flexed in any degree.2) Heat and temperature changes (whether cumulative effects of many years of seasonal changes, or from having been exposed for shorter periods of time to heated conditions.3) Ultraviolet light exposure (can produce changes in color characteristics as well as changes in pliability). 4) Gradual dehydration or drying out of the insulation over time.I haven't tried to find solutions to the brittle cable problem, but I have found that the following treatments will work on various cable insulation materials:1) Lucas Power Steering Stop Leak. (this softens rubbers and plastics, and will probably work on PVC and Teflon in some degree). This is the thick gooey dark-red gel. 2) Whitestone Renewal Gel. (softens rubber, plastics and other materials - not as drastically as the power-steering stop leak, but it does soften the materials over time. 3) WD-40 (this works more on the surface of plastics, although it may work it's way deeper into the plastic if allowed to soak over some time.

How do I find out who provides my water?
Ask nicely in writing.Get and use names whenever you can. Ask elected representatives in your jurisdiction.Involve othersSqueeze whomever you ask by "cc"ing the local news agencies (print, radio, and television) if they brush you off. Let the person know that others are interested in this potential environmental/political/health issue. Involving the news media will force the issue. It is the equivalent of pouring gasoline on a fire.Regional water resources are tested and the results are usually part of the public record stored at the town hall department for building permits, premises, registry of deeds, or nearby. A real estate broker or salesperson can usually find answers to such a question.Local water can become contaminated between the public source and the user. If you suspect a problem, a good first step would be to verify your specific situation and then work from there. Maybe the landlord will split the cost of analysis with you. It's a deductible expense for the landowner in a rural area. Perhaps, a test has already been made because periodic testing is required by law.A private nearby water-testing service would make it their business to know if their results are common to a specific aquifer.Social MediaSome might include social media to get an idea of what others have experienced. 
What are the other substitutes for an iron?

How to completely be rid of bed bugs
Vigilance and PermethrinPermethrin is an insecticide which kills insects nearly instantly and lasts for up to a month on surfaces. This means you can spray it on the seams of your mattress and the frame, your furniture, carpet, baseboards, and even your luggage and clothes to stop an outbreak and prevent picking up bed bugs from traveling.The one downside to Permethrin is it will kill your cats, but if you don't have any cats, then you can use it throughout your house (also may be useful against unwanted cats). I originally tried diatomaceous earth (prehistoric seashells) but ran into a few problems. One, diatomaceous earth gets everywhere, and your living space will be super dusty. Two, diatomaceous earth will dry out your skin on contact, so if you have it along your bed or on furniture, you'll see the affects. Three, it is a slow killer. I timed that it took anywhere from twelve to twenty four hours to kill a bed bug after being exposed. While a slow death might be preferable to a sadist, in a bed bug invasion you want to kill them as quickly as possible. Permethrin is available on Amazon or other places. Diatomaceous earth can typically be found at a Walmart or anyplace with a garden area. It has the advantage of being all natural and super cheap. VigilanceIn order to eliminate bed bugs from your actual bed, move you bed away from the walls so no part of it (or blankets and sheets) touches the ground or the walls. Examine the bed thoroughly and remove any bed bugs and spray seams with Permethrin (or use Lysol wipe to one-time kill eggs or bed bugs). Place your bed posts in bowls or plastic containers. Apply baby powder from the bed post bottoms to a few inches up the legs (this will prevent bed bugs from being able to climb your posts). Place an agent of death in the plastic bowls (either diatomaceous earth or Permethrin). Now when bed bugs come crawling in the night they will enter the bowls, be unable to climb the bed posts, and die the death they so richly deserve. You may do similar things to couches, chairs, or anywhere with fabric that you sit or lie down. I had bed bugs coming from an adjacent apartment (through the walls), and I ultimately sprayed all the baseboards, cracks, and socket / light switch plate areas with Permethrin. I found a couple of bed bugs in some of my folded clothing, so I washed and dried all my clothing (using a dryer) which killed any bed bugs hiding in them. I then stored my clothing in large 10 gallon ZipLock bags while I was waging my war. This prevented my clothing from becoming recontaminated (Bed bugs are attracted to heat and CO2, so freshly dried still warm clothing sitting in the house may attract them). Finally, I made a pact with the Devil and sold my soul, after that the infestation disappeared. In summation: Related bed bug comics: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

How to make sure I can't be heard by neighbours (without asking them)?
Best way I can suggest: ask.  Ask the ones on your floor closest to your shower; ask the ones above and below your apartment.If they don't know offhand, they probably aren't being bothered by it.  If they hem and haw, they probably are.  If they fetch a shotgun, well -- they probably won't.Another clue -- if you can hear them, they can hear you.  If you hear bedroom noises or bathroom noises from your neighbors, it's a cinch they can hear them from you, so act accordingly.
How can I more quickly warm up the interior of my car during winter?
-30 this morning in Fairbanks Alaska. If you really want to know how to warm and maintain a vehicle during a truely cold winter (not the stuff a lower 48er considers cold) you need to ask an Alaskan or Canadian.Here is a list for you to do a search on:•block heater•oil pan heater•battery; blanket, pan heater or trickle charger•transmission heater•radiator thermostat (winter) •grill cover•seat warmer (these are nice)•low viscosity oil (winter weight)•winter coolant•high idle switch or idle adjust•auto start.....or if you want to save money just build a heated garage
How can I get all the applesauce out of the jar?
The jar appears to be plastic.  If so, you could use sharp and sturdy shears to cut the jar in half, vertically, through the mouth and down to the bottom. Once the jar is separated into two halves, it will be much easier to remove the rest of the applesauce. A basting brush, with bristles an inch or two wide, can be drawn along these ridges to wipe the applesauce into a container.
How can I more quickly warm up the interior of my car during winter?
First thing, park in the sun.Beyond this, we're assuming a gasoline or diesel engine, not a hybrid or electric vehicle (most of those have electric heaters and will start blowing hot pretty quickly anyway).If, like me, you leave home for work before the winter sun is up, or must park under cover but without heated space, your engine will warm faster with the heater off (it acts like a radiator, but without benefit of a thermostat to control coolant flow through its core), and under load.  Don't turn on the air conditioning, but do turn on lights and (electric) rear defogger if available.  Don't run the heater fan, and set the temperature control to cold (you want to close off coolant flow through the heater core).Now, move off as soon as the oil pressure is normal (warning light out or gauge in range).  Watch the engine temperature gauge, and turn on the heat or front defogger (as you choose or need) as soon as the temperature is off the peg, or at least two minutes after startup if you don't have a gauge.These steps will give you the fastest engine warm up, hence soonest useful heat, and avoid wasting fuel at idle (when you're getting zero miles per gallon), as well as limiting engine wear (a cold engine doesn't wear faster under load than at idle, but warms faster under load).  In that light, if you have to deice the windshield and windows before departure, scrape before starting the engine.  The exercise can warm you, a little, and if you're properly dressed the weather won't chill you or your hands.Once you're on your way, drive with appropriate caution; watch out for ice, especially on bridges and overpasses.
How can I more quickly warm up the interior of my car during winter?
Revving the engine will make it warm up faster but it is not a good idea to rev a cold engine.  The metal parts are contracted so extra gaps.  The oil is not warmed up.  You should let it just idle for at least a couple minutes.  The oil will warm up pretty fast.  You should see the oil pressure come down a little bit when the oil warms up.  I wait for the idle speed to come down.When it is cold the engine will just circulate water in the block.  The block is massive so there is a lot of heat capacitance.   The transmission will also pull off heat.I wait to see the temperature gauge move and then turn on the heat / defroster.Or you can just turn on the heater / defroster first thing.  Yes it will take longer for the engine to warm up but you will also get some heat in your vehicle. Don't rev the engine or accelerate hard until it is up to normal operating temperature.  Turn on lights and electrical heater(s) is good for a light load. If you are in a hurry I suggest a heavy coat, hat, and gloves.  If you let it idle a full 15 minutes to heat up that is a bit of fuel.  If you are willing to drive easy the vehicle is ready to go after a couple minutes.  If you only need to drive a few miles then just gut it out.Window fogging up and deicing is another thing.  Recirculate to hold in heat but you will need to to bring in external air if the windows fog.  My hack is wear more clothes.
How can I more quickly warm up the interior of my car during winter?
Seems something is wrong with your car. 15 min is too long period i guess.Check if your thermostat got stuck in "long circuit" position, when the main radiator become a part of water circuit.. Because when the engine is cold, the thermostat must be in "short circuit" position and the main radiator is disconnected from the cooling circuit for more fast engine heating.
How to remove formation due to AC water outlet?
For cleaning the calcium formations you can try to use cleaning liquids for bathroom/kitchen.To prevent of appearance of new layer of formation you can use a piece of hose, attached to the stock outlet by using armored scotch tape. Hose must have bigger diameter than the  outlet's diameter to prevent the cluttering with wet dust or with mustiness or something else. Instead of scotch tape you can use cable tie or the sanitary screw coupling. Point the hose to the closest side of balcony if possible, so people on floors below won't see water on their heads and hand-rails (e.g. when it is windy).Anoter and faster way is to use plastic bottle with removed bottom - scotch tape, glue, screw through bottle neck etc.
How can I get all the applesauce out of the jar?
Hold the jar by the bottom.Swing your arm real fast a few times.Stuff in jar moves to top. Reminder for folks whose imaginations may not be too physically oriented: Do it with the lid on. If you don't have a lid I'm sure you can figure something out.Or cut plastic jars with scissors (not a knife/saw), and get in there with your fingers...
Possibile ways to charge a mobile in a train
I am afraid that there are no way to charge your phone fast enough without using of built-in AC sockets if they are present in train.Passenger trains may have an AC socket for electric razors, at toilet. If you are lucky man and your train has AC socket and if your phone supports fast(quick) charge, you will have enough time to increase your battery level for 10-20% from 0, while you are in toilet, until next man who wants the toilet will start knocking. You also may use AC splitter and charge simultaneously your phone and your power bank. Another way is to try to use the USB hand crank dynamo charger (very cheap, easy to buy), but it produces too small power and too big noise for regular using.

Two words, one tool which will save you time and money with all jars, Tupperware, pots& pans:RUBBER SPATULA
How can I get all the applesauce out of the jar?
Let it warm up when you want to get the last amounts out of the jar.Spoilage will not be a concern if it's at room temperature for 24 hours.When it's warmer, it will be less viscous, and will therefore not stick to the sides as much, and flow out of the jar more easily.
Safety pin of fire extinguisher broke, how to make it active in terms of need?
If you're in the middle of a fire, you shouldn't be posting on Lifehacks SE, you should be evacuating the building.  (joke)The general rule is, only fight a fire if it's either quite small, or you need to do so to clear an evacuation route.  That said, if you were trapped by a fire and the only extinguisher in reach had this problem, you'd need some kind of tool to pull the remains of the pin out of the handles so you could activate the extinguisher.  In an office environment, I'd look for scissors -- they can act a bit like a small-nose pliers or wire cutter, in terms of gripping the short straight end of the pin.  Another option might be nail clippers (which many people carry with them) or a multi-tool (forbidden in some office environments because of attached knife blade, but pretty common otherwise -- I carry one every day).One slightly out-of-the-box idea would be to very gently squeeze the handles to take the spring tension off the pin hole, and see if the pin will just drop out (turn the extinguisher on its side and shake) or strike the short end of the pin with the base of a stapler, paperweight, or similar, in hopes of driving it through so it doesn't lock the handles any longer.
How can I get all the applesauce out of the jar?
Here's a little "tip" that works for me.Try tipping the jar slightly as you tap the bottom corner of the jar against the counter top or the palm of your other hand. After several "taps" in the same spot, you'll see the sauce start to pool near the bottom of the jar and along the bottom-most part of the jar side. Tipping the jar will help the sauce between the ribbed sides "flow" more easily toward the jar corner. The tapping need not be violent or very hard. Start with light taps and experiment until you get the right combination of angle and force. Repeat as necessary. Continue until the bulk of it is in one convenient spot in the jar to reach with a spoon. Warm sauce flows more easily than cold.The same technique also works with other viscous blends and purees such a ketchup, chili sauce, and salsa.If you don't tap too hard, you can do the same thing with glass jars and bottles with no damage.
Is writing "Return to Sender" on junk mail effective for reducing the amount of junk mail one receives?
Generally speaking - no.  The sender won't care, they've budgeted for it.The only way I have found that works most of the time, is to write "Addressee Deceased" on the envelope and then return it to sender.Even the most dedicated senders don't want to send mail to the dead.
Is writing "Return to Sender" on junk mail effective for reducing the amount of junk mail one receives?
This is completely ineffective.  Most junk mail (at least in the USA) is sent in a mail class that doesn't even provide return service; all you accomplish is to task the Postal Service with transporting the mail piece to a Dead Letter Office, where it will be destroyed, if it isn't destroyed at an earlier step in the dead letter process.Functionally, there is no way to get off junk mailing lists; many bulk mailers simply buy listings of all valid addresses in a particular geographic region and send their pieces to Every. Single. Address.  These are often the ones marked "Resident" or addressed to someone who might have moved years before (with "Or Current Resident" appended).  Even on more targeted lists, like customers of particular businesses (those that ask your address at checkout, or issue loyalty cards, for instance), once you're on the list, you probably can't get off it.Best I can suggest is that you might be able to heat your house for "free" (you'll spend some of your labor, but little to no money) if you can manage to get on enough junk mailing lists -- there are a number of videos on YouTube on the subject of converting junk mail to homemade stove or fireplace fuel.  There are many documented cases of people managing to completely stop paying for winter heat with similar methods (though if you live in a region prone to air quality issues, burning bans may affect this).
Stopping a twist timer
The timer was put there by the storage owner so that their electric bill isn't subject to abuse by people renting the units.  It also prevents (for instance) people using the units as marijuana growing facilities, or other kinds of production (legal or otherwise) and getting the storage service to pay the electric bill.  If there isn't an unswitched outlet in the unit, there isn't a "hack" to bypass the timer, and as you note, altering the wiring would surely violate your rental agreement.If your need for long term power is low-draw, you may be able to rig something using batteries and an inverter, but you'd still have to supply the power to charge the batteries, or put a screw-in outlet in the light socket to providing charge on the timed power (and be limited to the amount of charge you can put into the battery in an hour at a time). As Robert Cartaino noted in comments, if light is all you need, a suitable battery lantern is probably a better solution than trying to find a way to defeat the light switch timer.
How can I (painlessly) add/remove keys to my key ring?
If you have one of those nail files with a point on the end, you can use that to add and remove keys.
Stopping a twist timer
A hack is a duct tape over the timer if it physically moves.  Not saying it would work or even if it does be appreciated by the owner but is worth a try.  Not recommended but changing out hot can be done.  120V is not going to kill you unless you just hang on and the circuit does not trip.
Stopping a twist timer
It is somewhat jarring to have the lights suddenly go off when you are in the middle of something, but the timer is necessary to ensure the lights aren't left on long after you are gone. If you want to ensure the lights stay on without disruption, set a recurring reminder for 55 minutes on your smart phone (or kitchen timer) so you can reset the light timer if a longer duration is needed. That will give you a bit of time to turn that twist-timer back when it is convenient… rather than getting caught stumbling around in the dark when the lights go off unexpectedly. 
How to extend the lifetime of a rechargeable battery?
To extend the lifetime of your rechargeable battery: - Use a powerfull charger, avoid the charge thru the USB connector of a PC- Never goes under 20%- A quick charge is always better - 80% of charge in most cases is enough for a day (The last 20% are not so easy to fulfill)- Never put your phone in a cold or hot place, be carefull to the sunrays directly on it- Never use your phone during the charge
Stopping a twist timer
I have had to bypass a timer in an old storage unit once. I used a pair of vice grips on the dial of the timer so they looked like hands of a clock on the wall. Then I blocked their movement with a small nail, and patched the hole after.
Possibile ways to charge a mobile in a train
As an alternative to a power bank: you can get power banks and chargers that contain a solar panel. Place the solar panel against a window (preferably a sunlit window).
What is the best way to recondition a whiteboard?
FOR ANCIENT WHITEBOARDS THAT PROBABLY NEED TO BE REPLACED (not new):My whiteboard is old and I am not in the market for a new one anytime soon.  After each cleaning, I spray it lightly with cooking spray and remove the excess. It is still slightly oily when I use it.  The marker glides over the surface and the colors are just as strong. It is also much easier to clean afterwards.  I use the whiteboard cleaner with a soft cloth (paper towel makes small abrasions) to get it as clean as possible then start all over again with the oil. The markers don't seem to mind and this is extending the life of a geriatric whiteboard.
How to determine strength of reading glasses?
Qick and easyHold the glasses in front of a white paper or wall until the sun (or a far away window) is in focus. Measure the distance (in metre) between the glasses and the paper. Divide 1 by this value to obtain the glasses dioptre.Physics behind thisReading glasses are similar to a thin looking glass. The same optical rules apply to them:Source: German WikipediaIn the picture above we can see the object G distance g, the distance b of a projected image B and the resulting focal length f. By measuring g and b we can calculate the dioptre 1/f of our lens with this formula:To make things easy we may take a far away object such as the sun (where 1/g approximates 0) to measure the distance b between the lens and the sun's projection on a white paper to have a simplified formula for the dioptre1/f ≈ 1/b.
How to keep bread fresher for longer
I putchased La Brea Organic Wheat loaf Non Gmo and it has a hint of sour dough taste and it is a bread that is not only extra pleasing to the eyes but the taste is tantalizing to the point my PB&J sandwich tasted like a food I was trying for the first time. I freeze the bread in its orginal packaging or zip lock freezer bags and add my fixings and let it set a few seconds and it taste as fresh as the day it was made. It is not freezer burned nor is the taste, texture or apperance altered in any way shape or form. La Brea is found at Harris Teeters.  Mine was sliced. I am a regular citizen who was looking for organic and La Brea is extraordinary. Fixings are put on once I remove it from the bag and start to fix sandwich. It only takes a few seconds for bread to thaw. I find in relation to breads made large batches such as found in grocery stores freezing yields the exact same results.

Could smoke odor be originating from the HVAC system of an adjacent townhome?
No this would not be the HVAC system as they are usually electrically powered. Even if there was something wrong with the unit on the rooftop i.e overheating you'd smell a chemically burning plastic smell not just generic smoke. It may however be a Diesel UPS generator depending on the nature of operations within the building. However judging by the little detail you have given I'd say it is unrelated  to HVAC. Hope this helps. 
How to keep bread fresher for longer

How can you lock a luggage's wheels to stop them from moving?
A pink pencil eraser cut into a wedge shape can be jammed between wheel and caster base on two wheels, to act as a brake.  It can be inserted and removed in seconds, and makes no permanent changes to the luggage.  If you find the large size, you can probably make two such wedges from a single eraser for under a dollar.
Extra shoes for Inline Skating
The shoes I'm used to calling "Chinese shoes" (also sometimes called "Kung Fu shoes", easily found in any Chinatown in America or Europe) can be folded flat or rolled to fit in a large pocket, or left hanging out of a hip pocket (where American men commonly carry a wallet).  The pair weighs only a couple ounces (50+ grams), and while not extremely durable, they're at least as good as house slippers for foot protection and durability -- plus, they're inexpensive (around $10, based on a quick Google search).
What to do with the leftover part of a belt?
A great thing to do when a belt is too long is to use little elastic bands or 'rainbow looms' matching the color of your belt. Before putting on the belt put on the elastic bands to the side of the belt that has the buckle at its end. Then when you put on your belt slide the end of the belt through the bands so that extra part does not hang out and irritate you. 
How to clean pomegranate drops from the ocher waterproof wall paint?
If you try to blur it using the wet sponge, there is a chance to make the situation worse. So I suggest you to the following steps:If the spots are at the center of a wall or at a position where eye gets contact instantly due to off color, then you try hiding it with any curious available. This arrangement can be done until you paint your wall for the next time.For testing purpose, the small quantity of paint is available with requested color. You can request for your color, have it painted on the spots. This would be the best idea as having this color in stock will help you if the same problem occurs in near future too as your painted surface is more prone to similar problems.
How can you lock a luggage's wheels to stop them from moving?
If you are serious about a hack, it will be better if you could replace two front wheels with this type of wheels.For this you could reach out to a repairer. This would help you to avoid inserting pencil eraser frequenlty. I hope you know about the working of these stoppers and would be easy to get started using this stoppers. I am not branding this same product, you could go for similar types.

Since they are so small, please be carefull while doing this as there is a chance for you to break them too.If required, you can also glue them up with fevi quick(or similar har d glue enough for plastics) if caps of head phones does not fit each other.
What are the home remedies to reduce hardness of water?
Actually, it depends upon the level of hardness which you can not identify using home techniques. The better idea is to approach water testing authorities in your locality that come under governmental jurisdiction with some of the water samples. They could direct you with exact method to solve this issue. Also, hacks can work only for a small period of time. Since this issue will arise regularly, you must resort to a permanent solution.Boil the water to its boiling point. Check if this water has lost its hardness. If yes then the water have soft hardness.(Just one method of many to resolve this issue, you can try this)
What are the home remedies to reduce hardness of water?
There are no life-hack solutions for this.  To treat hard water, you need a water softener, which is a device that gets installed in your water supply and has to be filled with the right chemicals every few months.  Salty water is another problem entirely. The water softener doesn't help with this. Ordinary sea salt shouldn't be a problem for your skin and hair, but other compounds could still taste salty.  You need professional testing to find out what has contaminated your water. 
What are the home remedies to reduce hardness of water?
You can mix washing soda to the water and then filter it if any precipitation occurs. Though it is not an very easy technique, it works.
How to keep shirts white?
Loss of brighteners from the fabric will cause whites to become dull even if bleached every wash.  You need to put the brighteners back to restore the whiteness to its original value.  There are commercial laundry products that offer this -- generally they're sold as "brightening" detergents aimed mainly at colors, but they'll brighten whites as well.An old fashioned solution specific to whites, to overcome the yellowish tint they tend to acquire, was bluing -- but I don't know if bluing is even available in the laundry section of the supermarket any more (haven't looked for it in ages).  Bluing isn't really a brightener, but it offsets the yellowish natural color of cotton and linen, to make them seem whiter.  It won't restore the brightness of modern treated fabrics, but it may help some.
How to keep shirts white?
Grey:  Your clothing may be picking up mineral deposits; try a bit of vinegar in the wash.Yellow:  If your clothing is polyester, bleach can actually cause yellowing. Pink:  If your whites look pink, look for that one stinking new-ish red item that you left over from the previous wash :-)
What are the home remedies to reduce hardness of water?
If the water tastes salty, it's what's called "brackish".  As you note, this is not potable water; drinking brackish water may cause kidney failure and other health problems.  A water softener won't resolve salty water; in fact, it'll tend to make it worse.What you really need is a filtration system -- Reverse Osmosis or deionizing, or the combination often called RODI (reverse osmosis deionized).  This will produce very pure water that's suitable for washing, drinking, and cooking.  Unfortunately, it's also expensive, because both the membrane cartridge and the DI filter that follows it up have limited life, and the process wastes much of the water it takes in.  Also, affordable RODI systems produce a limited number of gallons per day, usually with little or no pressure on the filtered output.A good compromise system is a filter like those sold by Pur or Brita for drinking water.  You can filter enough water for washing and drinking every day with a filter that will cost around $10 four times a year for refill cartridges.  The water produced is generally tasteless and shouldn't contribute to problems caused by your current non-potable supply.
How to control phone while inside VR device without an action button

How to stop losing pencils/where to put them at school
You could insert the cap of the mechanical pencil inside the 'self-loop' of your uniform tie. I am estimating that your uniform to school has a tie too.
How to stop losing pencils/where to put them at school
One word: lanyard.A fine cord tied around the body of the pencil under the clip (so the pencil can be hung by the cord), with the other end attached to your clothing, a neck loop (one that can't pull tighter if it snags, please), or your backpack or notebook, and long enough not to interfere with use of the pencil.Even if (like American college students) you won't wear a uniform, this should keep your pencil with you.
How to stop losing pencils/where to put them at school
Some backpacks have a pen/pencil pocket.  Or you could clip your pencil to your stack of writing paper.  Or keep the pencil in your hand when you walk to class. The back pocket of your pants isn't a good place to store any rigid object like a pencil, because when you sit down, the pocket gets folded up and the pencil is forced out.  If you have long hair, you could use the pencil as a hair pin :)

Cleaning MicroUSB socket on mobile phone
You can clean it by inserting small piece of paper and gently loosening the dirt inside. Just cut a small stripe from preferably good quality paper so that the paper won't get torn and get stuck inside. Paper is flexible and can help by bending and reaching the dirt. Off-course, the paper must be inserted straight and not like in paper ball/folded way. I use this method and it works well for me.Tip: Make sure that you have removed mobile battery(if it's removable) before cleaning, to make sure that you won't short circuit it. 
How can I (painlessly) add/remove keys to my key ring?
As a preventative measure, I keep a small carabiner on my main key ring, and attach peripheral keychains to the carabiner instead of the ring when I need them. It reduces the number of times I have to fiddle with key rings and lets me travel with fewer keys - for example, if I'm biking to school then I will take the car keys off the carabiner and leave them at home.For the times when you do have to remove keys from the ring, JSW189's staple-remover method looks promising.

Hacks to reduce pain due to a injection
Chill the area to be injected with ice or an ice pack for a few minutes before the injection. A bag of frozen vegetables works well for this. Cold will dull the nerves and lessen the amount of pain felt.
Open a bottle without bending the cap
Using a common crown cap opener, if you lift just enough for the cap to move (first time or two you'll also hear the hiss of pressure released from inside the bottle), then rotate the bottle relative to the opener (about 1/8 turn is good), before lifting just enough to move the cap again, and work around, you should be able to work the cap off without significant damage to the top.  The crimp will, of course, be opened, but there should be very little if any distortion of the cap above the crown section.
Open a bottle without bending the cap
The answer given by Maneesh Mohan would work, but I would add that there are many possible ways to open a bottle from below like that. In my experience, different tools work better for different kinds of bottles. In general, you can use anything sturdy as a lever: with one side below the crown and your hand as the fulcrum (holding the neck of the bottle, just below the cap). Things often used: a knife (sideways, with the back of the blade), any lighter, another bottle (even an open one, if you're skilled), etc.  Whenever you open the bottle this way, the cap generally stays unbent. With virtually every purpose-made opener the cap gets bent because it places the hinge-point on the cap, instead of externally.
Open a bottle without bending the cap
To acquire a completely unbent bottle cap, break the bottle. This is messy and wasteful, and probably dangerous, but if you shatter the neck of the bottle into small pieces, most of the time the cap will remain pristine.  (Every now and then, you'll wind up with a ring of glass inside the cap, and that would be hard to break/remove.)
How to clean a pager charging port
If it is a delicate connection, I wouldn't ever use sandpaper on it (nor do I think it would help). Connector problems usually fall in two categories: the pins and the jack do not connect properly (for example because of dust), or the the connector(s) have a faulty connection internally.Cleaning the connectors would only solve anything if the problem is in the first category. In that case, the problem is usually because of dust and/or grease. Looking at some pictures online (which would have been helpful), I see that the pins are accessible quite easily. Take a q-tip, or a piece of lint-free cloth, dip it in some rubbing alcohol and clean the pins (careful with the amount of alcohol).For the receptors/jack, we would need a bit more information on the size of the hole for more precise answers. However, one thing that you can definitely try, is some compressed air. I have used that many times to get some dust out of a micro-usb jack.
How do I seek justice against vending machines?
To get back at a vending machine that has cheated you by taking money for out-of-stock items, has failed to vend, or was out of quarters for change yet still counted "air" quarters, simply unplug the vending machine. This will cause the vending company to loose a little business and therefore level the playing field.
How does one efficiently clean-up loose hair strands from one's back after washing hair in the shower? Is there a gadget designed to help with this?

How can I keep my door locks from freezing during a winter storm?
Keyless locks are a good investment but mine were prone to freezing.  Another consideration - sufficiently cold enough temperatures can reduce the effectiveness of the batteries that reduced power output prevents the locks from opening.My door lock thawing cure is to use an ordinary hand-held electric hair dryer to apply heat to them.  Thankfully, it is a snap and can be done from inside the warm building.

How to clean bathroom floor marble without using hard chemicals?
Marble FloorsFor marble flooring, the Marble Institute advises dust-mopping floors frequently and cleaning with a mild, phosphate-free biodegradable liquid dishwashing soap or powder, or a stone soap. Soapless cleaners minimize streaks and film. After washing, rinse with clean water and dry.The MIA also cautions against using cleaners that contain acid, such as bathroom cleaners, grout cleaners, and tub and tile cleaners, which can cause etching. And don’t use bleach. If you bleach it, it will break the shine down. Stick to soap and water.”In addition, avoid using old vacuums, because metal attachments and well-worn wheels may scratch the surface.

Reviving dead tennis balls
You can easily make your own repressurizing device.  Get plastic pipe parts of large enough diameter that the balls will slip inside, glue a cap on one end and a thread adapter on the other.  Put a replacement car tire valve in the center of a screw cap that fits the threads.  Slip the balls inside, screw the cap on tightly, and use any air pump or compressor to pump up the inside of the tube to the pressure you want the balls to have inside.Wait, and check pressure on the device every week.  I doubt there's any way to speed up the process, but this will save (a little) money; you can probably build this for around $10, perhaps less if you already have pipe or a tire valve lying around.

How to completely be rid of bed bugs
Safe and works: baking soda. Follow these steps in the morning if you're going to be out of the home for the day:Steam clean your furniture, mattress, bed and box spring deep, take an hour, use a very good steamer, nothing flimsy. Throw your bedding and clothing in the washer and dryer, on high heat if you won't damage them. ALL of your clothes and linens. Curtains and all. Even the things that are put away. Pillows too. Handwash your delicates and line dry.Move your furniture away from the walls. Nothing should touch them. And steam your empty dressers, drawers, closets, walls and baseboards.Place double sided tape around the bottom of your furniture legs, if metal. If wooden, just,  lay duct tape under the legs, sticky-side up, making sure the square of tape is big enough to be visible on all 4 sides. This will catch bugs before they try to climb up onto your furniture.Vacuum good and thorough. If your floors are wooden or tile, perfect. Clean all floors. Take the vacuum or mop outside to dump it/wring it out, clean them outside so no eggs or bugs are left on these things... Using bleach and a water hose is great. Sprinkle the baking soda onto your floor, concentrating on the edges by your walls, in the doorway, near your bed base and the base of your furniture. Leave this for the day. The baking soda splits the bugs' bellies open when they crawl over it. When you get home, vacuum and/or mop again. Wipe down the baseboards. Wipe out your dresser drawers. Fold your clothes and put them away. Restock your closet. Yes this is all a lot of work. But the alternative is itching from bites every night and losing sleep.Enjoy a bedbug-free home. You haven't endangered your kids or pets with harsh chemicals and you can finally sleep peacefully again!
Best method of getting a wine label off a wine bottle?
At least where I live (Germany) most of the labels are glued with a fat-solvable glue. So, you cover the whole label in a thin layer of butter or margarine (or other, non-liquid fat), let it sit for a while (I wait a day, but that's most likely overkill) then peel the label off.Wipe the bottle afterwards with a kitchen paper (remember not to wash fat down the drain) and you're done.
How to clean leather wallet that has been soaked in coffee?
Speaking as one who did inadvertently put his leather wallet through the washing cycle...   It is a very soft black aniline leather, so I feared the worst. A lot of colour came out of it, into everything inside it. My driver's license will forever bear the marks, though oxygen bleach recovered it & the currency notes sufficiently to read/spend. All my bank cards survived, NFC & chip & PIN.You won't have the same problems, of course, as you can choose to remove everything else first.The wallet itself, aside from some slight shrinkage in the stitching - cotton rather than artificial fibre I would presume - actually survived the incident reasonably well, & is still in use to this day.I'd recommend putting it in a zipped patch-type trouser pocket to keep the wallet in shape, & a gentle, cool, short wash. Dry naturally afterwards, of course. [Mine was discovered before it went through the tumble dryer too - I don't think that would have done it much good at all.]When it comes out, flex & stretch it to preserve the shape & the stitching.One caveat.Because of the difference in manufacturing & finishing of different leather types, you may have less success if it is not made of aniline leather. Split leathers have a plastic-like coating, which is likely to strip if it gets too wet & is then subject to mechanical wear.If it's that type, then I wouldn't do more than give it a quick rinse in warm soapy water.
Best method of getting a wine label off a wine bottle?
We reuse glass bottles for storing herbs from the garden. To remove the label, I take a razor blade and run it at about a 30-0 degree angle to the glass. It doesn't scratch the glass, but it lifts the label. There is occasionally a little bit of the glue left, but I just use 90% rubbing alcohol. Finally, I was the container in hot water next time I do dishes which gets the rest of the residue off.
How to avoid paper sticking together in a printer?
I know this is an old question but other people may still be coming across it (like I did).  As the previous answer indicated, fanning is usually a good way to prevent paper from sticking together.  Here are some other solutions.Keep the paper in its packaging (unopened) as long as possible.  If you don't go through a lot of paper, but you take out a couple reams and load them in your copier or printer, they will be more likely to stick or cause jams than if you leave reams unopened until you need to use them.Use good-quality paper.  Higher-quality paper is typically more expensive, but it runs through a printer so much better.  Some good brands of paper that in my experience don't jam as much as other brands include HP, Xerox, and Hammermill.Monitor the humidity.  Paper stored in a very humid room will be more likely to stick together.  Especially in the summer, when it's hot and humid, do whatever you can reasonably do to prevent excessive humidity.  Some larger printers offer tray heaters, which can also help with paper sticking together.Flip the paper every now and then.  Some printers have flat paper trays, but others only have partial bottoms, which causes the paper to bend or droop, which can lead to jamming issues.  Every so often, take the paper out, fan it, and put it back in upside-down, to help even out any drooping in the paper stack.
Replacement for broken zipper in pants
My suggestion would be to use the Velcro.  There are many options out there; by either sewing it on, stick-on, or using heat.  If you are looking to save time, my suggestion would be the heat fusion technique.  This can come in either stick-on or heat activated.If you are affixing this to denim, I would suggest heat activated fusion because the material is so thick.Stick-on VelcroIron-on VelcroSew-on Velcro

How can I keep washed salad for a long time?
Whether I buy salad in a bag or I buy it in a plastic container, I always wash it again when I get home.  This is something that my grandmother and mother taught me.  Any type of salad spinner will work just fine similar to the one referenced below (this is actually the one I have):Once you buy the salad from the store, you should wash it as soon as possible.  Simply dump the contents in the spinner. Rinse the lettuce for 20-30 seconds.Spin it.Dump the water out.Repeat.Place in the container of your choice.This usually adds a considerable more amount of time to the life of the lettuce.

How to stop cups sticking to placemats
When you pick up your cup, do it by the very bottom, and then use your pinkie to push whatever the cup is sitting on away from the cup. You'll leave the napkin/coaster/placement on the table, and your cup will be in your hand.Note that this works both right- and left-handed (try it; it's hard to pick up a cup with your pinkie on top).
How to get paint out of fabrics and jumpers?
You should have rinsed it out when it was still wet, in that case, you would not have had more than maybe a stain left which most likely would have washed out if put through a wash in the washing machine while still wet.Now you will have to dissolve the paint in such a way that does not damage the fabric.For that, you will find specialized solvents (often in sticks or small bottles) in the local stores. Names differ per country and I am not in an English language country. Ask for the one that does dissolve or clean out acrylic paint or read all the small script on each of the bottles till you are sure you have the best match.Alternatively, if you have several solvents available, try them out on a test piece you can make for this.When you have the solvent or are trying out the solvents do not start with the paint but first test them out on a bit that does not show, the inside of a seam is mostly the best option. A separate piece of fabric of the same make is often better but not available.While working, make sure you do not make the situation worse by allowing the paint to run away, best work on a horizontal workspace and keep blotters at hand to take away all liquidized paint.And you may want to wash the fabric after a session of work, so you wash away the paint while it is wet, not allowing it to dry on you.
How to stop cups sticking to placemats
Sprinkle a little salt or other small solid particles on the mat before using it. This can prevent the seal from forming between the condensation/residual moisture and allows you to freely use the cup until it's all dissolved.

Don't let yourself get in the situation from the start.I'm sure you must have a something... a tea-towel, handkerchief, tissue, kitchen roll, trouser-leg, etc. near to hand.Dab the bottom of the cup before you leave the kitchen.  Your mat will look nicer for longer too. there's nothing worse than a sticky old place-mat, that the owner doesn't notice... yet everyone else does.

How to clean bathroom floor marble without using hard chemicals?
Wet Baking SodaI have had to clean white bathtubs before where the stains were so hard to remove that even oven cleaner would not clean away the dirt.

How to reduce eye strain caused by constant exposure to computer screen?
Make sure the lighting is right. Turning the screen on, have a check if you can see your surrounding or not. If you can, it's too light in the room and this will cause quicker eye strain. But on the other hand, if the screen is brighter than your surrounding it will also cause quicker strain.

How can I keep washed salad for a long time?
I used to have this exact same problem.The way that I solved it is that I now make my salads out of pre-washed shredded red cabbage instead of shredded lettuce which seems to last much better after opening.I find that matchstick carrots also last well after opening.Admittedly, this is more of a workaround than a solution.

Good luck.

How to clean leather wallet that has been soaked in coffee?
... it depends...leather wallets often are built around a core layer of cardboard for added stability. While this still dries off ok after getting slightly moist, this cardboard does not stand up well to being soaked, tumbled and dried again.some wallets have a smooth "verneer"?-like coat applied. Again, this comes off during washing in flakes and does not survive.smooth, sturdy leather without additional fancy layers actually fares best. You can usually follow the instructions for cleaning saddle leathers and the like, using a mild detergent (saddle soap), and oiling the leather with a clear product that does not rub off afterwards. If the wallet feels stiff and breakable after washing, rub the oil/wax in gradually and work it gently until it feels smooth and flexible again.Speeding up the drying process with a hair dryer or placing the wallet upon a radiator will cause the leather to become stiffwhile drying. It usually works better to let it dry slowly and work it around a bit during the process.Caveat: staining shoe polish does give off colour to pockets and hands in everyday use on a wallet.split leather, or leather with a rough surface does not like being washed or oiled...
How to make my batteries work for a short time, one last time
I have three or four batteries lying beside my keyboard. They are used until they are fully out of energy. I just re-use one until it stops working, then go on to the next. Sometimes I get a whole day of use from them by alternating and overnight they sit idle until the morning when they start working again. Of course, this does not last forever, so I have new batteries at the ready. Still, I think it is a shame when people just throw them out the first time they stop.
How can I safely sanitise my smartphone's display?
I just cleaned mine with hydrogen peroxide. I put some on a washcloth, rubbed down the screen with it from back to sides and then wiped off. You can repeat this again. For cell phone case, I sprayed Lysol on it and waited for a while then rinsed and dried it off with a regular wash cloth. My phone looked brand new after doing this. I have a Lumia 640. I do not use screen protectors and also have no scratches or damage to the screen as I have had the phone for a good amount of time. Using other people's cell phones could make you sick.  I just read that I'm not supposed to use peroxide, so let me try with alcohol next time with a little water. I don't ever use microfiber cloths on my phone as the screen seemed pretty durable. Soft cotton rag seems fine. http://lifehacker.com/5875667/how-to-properly-clean-all-your-gadgets-without-ruining-themhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinekee/get-those-germs-off-your-phone-for-real?utm_term=.lwqWRPJgY#.nb0qDenO1

How can I keep my mouth closed while sleeping?
There are commercial products that run elastic under the jaw and over the top of the head to hold the mouth closed.  These are safe, because you an still open your lips and breathe past your teeth if your nose clogs (even if, for some reason, you're too disoriented to remove the elastic) and the elastic itself isn't strong enough to prevent wider, voluntary opening of your jaw if needed.  You could improvise something similar with wide waistband elastic from a fabric store or even an elastic bandage (Ace bandage or equivalent) -- but be sure an improvised device isn't so tight you can't pretty easily open your jaw; it's there to prevent the jaw falling open when you're asleep, not to keep your teeth together against intentional effort.

Removing hair dye from wall
The only option I can see short of high-filler sealing primer and then paint might be to bleach the dye using peroxide bleach similar to what your girlfriend most likely used on her hair before the dye step.  Peroxide is a very powerful oxidizer, and will denature most dyes.  It's likely to damage the paint, however, so if you rent, you may as well just leave it as is -- it'll cost you the same from your damage deposit when you move out either way.
I am sick and my nose is not running.Any hack for this to get back to normal?
Depending on why your nose is stuffy, certain things may work better than other things.  Here are some things to try:If it's not too cold outside, open a window to let some fresh air in.Use a humidifier or vaporizer if your room is very dry.  (The noise might help as well.)Prop your head up on several pillows and sleep on your back.  You can even prop the bed up if you want by placing boards under the wheels/posts at the head of the bed.Try a white noise machine, or a soothing CD or app (something that plays ocean sounds, nature sounds, or other calming noises).  White noise can work wonders for helping you fall asleep, even when you don't feel good.

I am sick and my nose is not running.Any hack for this to get back to normal?
Do an inhalation for a few days, preferably not long before bed. That just means finding a heat proof bowl, boiling a kettleful of water, put the water in the bowl, add whatever you've got that's menthol based (Vick, menthol and eucalyptus, olbas oil, karvol capsules, anything like that) if you have something, don't worry about it if you haven't, get a large towel, put the bowl on a table, sit down with the towel over your head and the bowl to make a sort of tent, lean over the steam coming from the bowl and inhale, preferably through your nose as far as is possible. You'll need some tissues handy...Sleeping with the window slightly open helps too. If it continues for months, see a doctor, you may have allergic rhinitis or a sinus infection.

What is the best way to clean up the spider webs?
I use the vacuum cleaner, with the long tube but without a brush.When most of the spiderweb has been removed you can use the duster or the item in your picture to remove the leftover bits, keep your dust sucker near to take care of cleaning the duster and/or the fallen bits of web.For a real nasty situation, you can use your duster or your 'photo item' and cover them with an old panty hose, which will allow you to take off all spiderweb rests in one go. Take that hose off and bin it.If available, also use a spare pair of eyes, as two see so much more than one. And if your helper is like mine, you take turns in cleaning and spotting, helping with the amount you need to do.Very bad situations, like cleaning out where there are many live webs, the method of using a piece of wood will work well.It does not need to be wood, any stick shaped item that is long enough will work, if working outside a rough branch will be best. But inside a house with paint or wallpaper you should not touch the walls with something that is likely to leave tracks.
Find out leak in airbed?
An alternative, as recently discussed on Bicycles, is to have your hand slightly wet and stroke the airbed in a regular pattern, so your hand covers the whole at one time or an other.First of all, the wet hand makes it easier to feel the air. Secondly, when the hand closes over the hole, it makes a much sharper note, often also much louder, than without the hand.When this does not work, you can use several of the other find leak in tube tricks.You do not need to fully inflate, even less over inflate an airbed.You can use a little air in only a small part of the bed, and have that in a basin of water which is just big enough for that part to be in, as long as you hold that part of the bed under water and under pressure.
How to avoid scratching door on garage door frame

How to remove leftover double-tape and sellotape marks after Christmas?
At work I have the use of a spray called 'seal and bond remover' which is designed for professional use where sticky tape and other sealers have to be removed.Having used it on years old sticky tape, partly with the plastic film still there, as well as on newer glue remains of sticky tape, I can assure you that it works.Even if the same product is not available where you are, (likely as we are in different countries) there might be an other prof spray or fluid on the market.Otherwise, old glue remains from sticky tape can be removed from almost all grounds by scratching. But you will have to be careful, your scratching tool should be softer than the surface you need to clean and there should not be sharp corners which can do damage even when not that hard.
How can I know if oatmeal is with milk or water?

What is the best way to recondition a whiteboard?
I think, just about anything with bleach will get rid of leftover marks on whiteboards. I used Softscrub with bleach, then (Very Lightly) dab and spread the solution over the spots. After a bit of this exercise, the marks disappeared completely. After this, you have to use a wet cloth or paper towel to wipe off all of the scrub solutions. Repeat this again. And finally, re-clean with proper Expo cleaner. The Expo cleaner uses "3-butoxypropan-2-ol" Ya.... it's basically a Glycol Ether. This puts a coating on the top of the board that helps prevent the Dry-Erase markers from sticking long-term. If you clean a board with alcohol it will feel sticky... if you clean it with Expo cleaner it feels somewhat slippery. This is the evaporated Glycol coating. 
How to store loose CDs and other discs without scratching them?
You could use a plastic freezer bag with a bubble envelope. Ultimate solution I suggest is a plastic CD case.
How to protect a CD without a case
The ideal case would be using thisBut if you are waiting for one such case(I hope by case, you meant this one itself), you could use this plastic cover in which blank CD's come to market:You could easily get them at nearby shop that sells these, as they are felt as waste.
How to protect a CD without a case
My own preference for this is olefin -- sold as the commercial product Tyvek in the USA, it's a slightly slippery material that looks felted, but is thin and extremely strong.  It's available in office supply stores as express envelopes, or in home improvement stores as house wrap.  It cuts with scissors, glues with hot glue or super glue, and can be easily fabricated into a CD sleeve by following the pattern for a paper one.  It's less abrasive than paper, so less prone to wear and scratches on the disk.
How to remove whitener ink from the clothes?
First of all, you can try good detergent that promises you to remove ink spots.If you can't find one, try following solutions:Squeeze a lemon and put some drops of vinegar on that. Let it soak for half an hour and then wash it with soap.Use Bleach for it.You can also try a wet cotton ball. Tap it at stains and repeat it for a while. Use new cotton ball if required.Pour salt on the stain and tap it with wet paper towel. Repeat this process until the stain is gone.
How to remove whitener ink from the clothes?
Most products of that type, in my experience, are more like a form of paint than ink.  That is, they're a latex based pigment carried in a water based solution, rather than a dye solution.  Most will come off with soap and water and scrubbing, especially before they're fully dry.  This obviously works best with durable clothing items; if you spilled this on a silk suit, take it to a professional, because you're more likely to completely destroy it than clean it, but if it's blue jeans, khaki, or similar sturdy stuff, get some soap, warm water, and a brush and scrub away.
How can I neatly eat messy food without "common" utensils?
Covering up.There are napkins which you place over your clothing, covering you from your neck down, if draped well covering all under the way of your food, from your plate to your mouth.One such I have seen was a big square of cotton or linen, made into a traditional napkin, with a button hole made in one corner. The napkin would be spread on the front of the person and a shirt button would come through the button hole just below the neck. The fabric being quite sturdy would stay where it was spread. Alternate attachment methods are clasps on a chain going round the neck, or clipping the napkins to the front of the clothing.Starch in your fabric napkin will help in it staying in place, as it will make the fabric more stiff.Not having clothing in the way.If you can chose where and when you eat, very juicy fruits are best eaten ready to get into the shower, while the water is already running to get to temperature.Alternatively, eat when you are already in the bath, although a bath with a shower is advised as you may want to rinse off when coming out of the water.I personally do not feel it as good a solution for hot food, like meats which drip sauce, certainly not while they are still hot.But a shower just after eating will clean your body all over.This does not keep you clean, it will clean you up after getting dirty.As a last option:Refrain from eating foods that would get you into trouble. This is what notable people do in public. Some going to the extend not eating anything in public.
How do I securely tie my shoes?
I use what Ian Fieggen calls the surgeans knot.Which is the same knot but a different method of tying as the secure knot of the same site.Basically, you tie your shoelaces the same way you usually do, checking that you do make a reef knot, not a granny, and when you bring your loop through, you do it twice.It is rather simple, slightly bigger than a usual bow but way more secure. New laces in my work boots would come undone in half an hour with the normal knot, not at all in 8 hours with this knot.If you can not get the bow to sit side ways on the foot, (so you are unable to use the reef knot,) try this method of tying the second half, single knot.Or learn to tie the first half of the knot in the other direction.That same site has loads more about shoe laces and their knots.
How to get rid of print from fabric clothing?
Perhaps instead of scratching each one of them, you could press strong adhesive tape down on top of letters, and then peel the tape off and that will pull off the letter. I like using duct tape for nearly everything, so that may work. Try it with one letter first. Also, the tape may leave some adhesive on the shirt, so you might need to Google how to remove duct tape adhesive from fabric. (Or you could use a different kind of adhesive tape.)
How can I wear my headset and glasses in a way that doesn't hurt?
If you have other glasses, this may be your solution: Remove the screws from both temples and set aside. Using the hinge on the glasses as an anchor,  replace temples with elastic cord cut-to-size to wrap around your head. I used a croaky cord attached with thread through each temple hinge.

How can I avoid getting static shocks in the winter?
Why static zaps happen often during winter or cold weather:During winter, static charges tends to build up because of low (relative) humidity in air. This is because when outside air is heated, it's (relative) humidity drops. The more the air is heated, the larger the humidity drop, so static zaps occur more often during colder outside temperatures.How static charge builds up on a person:If most of your static zaps occur after walking, they are probably caused by your plastic shoe soles rubbing against plastic floor material (carpet, linoleum, and some wood polishes). If your static charge buildup is after you have been sitting, it is probably caused by the rubbing of your (plastic) outer clothing against (plastic) seats.The ways to avoid static zaps:1) During cold weather, increase the humidity of inside air. You can use a humidifier in some buildings, but this usually not possible in cars or in other people's buildings. In those cases, you can use a spray bottle with water and apply a light mist to yourself. When drying clothes, stop your dryer before the clothes are completely dry; slightly damp/humid clothing won't have a static charge.2) Wear non-plastic clothing and shoe soles, and use non-plastic chair covers. Leather shoe soles stop carpet/walking static charges, and cotton or leather external layer clothing and/or seat covers stops static buildup from sitting (in buildings or cars)3) Use anti-static chemicals on your outer layer of clothing, shoe soles, carpet, and seat covers. You can use either anti-static sprays or rub anti-static dryer sheets on things to coat them with the chemicals that reduce static buildup. You can also home-make anti-static spray by mixing a small amount of liquid fabric softener and rubbing alcohol in water and then applying it from a sprayer.4) Discharge static buildup before it zaps you. When static charges build up on you it will always attempt to jump from your body to any large or grounded metal object. The zap you feel is the spark jumping the gap. If you are in firm contact with a metal object such as a key or ring and that metal object touches the metal before your skin does, the spark jump happens from metal to metal, and you don't feel the zap during the discharge.
Prevent rubber bands from ageing?
Rubber bands become brittle with age due not so much because of oxidation but rather due to evaporation of volatiles in the rubber/plastic material. These volatiles are parts of the plastic/rubber material that keep them soft and flexible, and the loss of them cause them to become stiff and break.Keeping rubber bands in unopened or otherwise airtight packaging and then storing the package in cool locations will prevent aging/brittleness. This is why rubber bands don't normally go bad in their original package but do when stored loose after opening. You see the same behavior in the rubber pickup rollers in laserprinters which become less flexible and 'sticky' over time due to the heat inside the printer, but stay 'fresh' while stored inside their original sealed packaging.
Removing soot and smoke smell after a house fire
My father was chemist and when the lab got smelly, he would be out pie pans of washing soda (sodium carbonate). Baking soda works, but much more slowly.  Arm & Hammer is a familiar brand.I used this method when a skunk sprayed in the house. It took 8-12 hours to eradicate the odor.I believe the firm hired to clean my house after a fire used the same method, but they said it was a trade secret and would not reveal what chemical they used.
Is there a way to erase pencil without a standard eraser?

The UK TV show 'Dragon's den' featured an invention by a 15-year-old schoolboy, which is now just coming to market, with the support of an almost unprecedented three of the 'Dragons' from the show.Boot Buddy was designed specifically for the task you describe.Failing that, the old standard solution of a hosepipe or outdoor tap [faucet] & a scrubbing brush has worked for many people for many years.For those who don't know the showDragon's Den has a panel of 5 highly successful businessmen & women, known as the Dragons [not least for their ferocity in grilling less-capable candidates], who invite potential new inventors & business startups to make their case for investment into their company. The Dragons invest their own money & time in the successful applicants' businesses, & of course, share in the rewards if the business grows.The show has actually turned out some extremely successful, multi-million pound businesses in its 16-year lifespan.I understand Canada also has a version of the show & it was also re-named to Shark Tank for a US version, so it may be better-known than I originally thought.
What is the best way to clean up the spider webs?
I did it today. I had to clean lots of spider's web. The best thing is to use a piece of wood and just hover it, the web sticks to the wood. You don't need to clean the wood just keep doing it in other areas. You may need to turn the wood so more web sticks to it.Although the tip of the wood was full of web as big as a lid of a jar it was still grabbing more and more webs. Once you drag that on every corner, the remains can be cleaned quickly with vacuum cleaner.
How to do you maintain the hair in-between coarse and shampoo-smooth hair?
This happens because you just took all the natural oil out of your hair and scalp, and you can take advantage of hair products in this case.There is a large range of options you can choose from, like hair mousses, oils and pomades.I would personally suggest using oil, as it is the closest to what our scalp naturally produces. One cheap and natural solutions is coconut oil. Just put a drop or two on the palm of your hands, rub them together and run them through your hair, mostly at the ends.It will give you the same effects as the 'few days no wash', and keep your hair nice and soft longer.You can also use it again after a few days if you feel like your hair is too dry.Here you can learn more about it.

How can I effectively patch up holes in insect screen?
Sewing will work.Old fashioned stitches that will just to the job will do, but you might do some more fancy embroidery stitches to improve the looks of the screen, at the same time hiding the damage. Google (search results here) on -hand sewing and embroidery stitches- for some options for sewing and embroidery stitches.The feather stitch will do both, basic repair as well as decoration. Use green yarn for the actual repair and head it with some bright colours for a flowerhead.The more damages, the more flowers the screen will get.If the kids are old enough they might even enjoy the act of repairing the screen, if you put it to them the right way.(Some kids will never, others may ask you to teach them embroidery.)
How can I straighten a twisted necktie?
Ironing may help but seeing the pictures I fear poorly made tie to start with.If it was an expensive tie, bring it to the shop (or the chain of shops) you bought it. When not returning them to the shop, check the washing information on the tie. If it is dry cleaning only, and you can not wear the tie as it is, try dry ironing.If you can wash it, wash as per information label and iron.In ironing, gently push it to get it flat again. If the twist orginates from the knot with which you tie your tie, you can try a different knot and try to close it less tight.And have you tried a tie pin to keep the tie in place even though it wants to turn?

How to quickly recover from jet lag?
+8 to -8... California to Japan, for instance?For you it ought to be relatively easy on the out-trip, you'll get the worst jet lag coming home.  I used to do London-Japan & meet a team from LA there. I was lagged on the way out, they were fine, they were lagged on the way home, I was fine.We all did this 4 or 5 times a year for 10 years, so we had plenty of practise. Sometimes we'd be there a week, sometimes 2 months, & different length stays affect your recovery.Some of this depends on what the local time is when you get to your final destination hotel etc [rather than what time you land]I used to land about noon, but not get to my final destination til 4 or 5 pm.The main 'trick' I used to use was to sleep as long as possible on the plane, so when you land your brain has a better chance of accepting it as 'morning'.Then I would stay up determinedly until midnight.Coffee is obvious, but go out for a meal, grab a beer, stay out in public so there's no opportunity to nod off. My colleagues from the US would arrive late enough to go straight to bed so there was no chance to do this in a group, which would have made it easier.Lots of people recommended melatonin tablets - I never found they made any difference whatsoever. They're also not licensed for sale in the UK so I had to borrow some from US colleagues to test them.Also - sleeping pills are not recommended for air journeys, so do the best you can without coffee & maybe grab a couple of whiskies, just enough to be able to nod off in all the racket on the plane. Take earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones.Sleeping on planes is a practised art, especially if you're in 'the chickens' as the crews call it, 'coach' or 'economy' as the public know it;-)One very odd but eminently reproducible twist is that on the first night you can't stay awake in the evening & can't wake up in the morning [though you must or you'll never get over it]. Each day you can stay up later & get up earlier. About a week or so into the trip this extends so far that your body is actually starting to wake up before you go to bed - so you get 3 or 4 nights of insomnia after about 1-2 weeks.Then you're through it & your lag is finally over.
How to quickly recover from jet lag?
Sleeping is the primary cause and symptom of jet lag. Consequently, any solutions will need to address that. Caffeine and alcohol may help, but the effectiveness varies by the individual. That's probably why you've excluded those.Methods to reset circadian rhythm should apply just as well to jet lag as other reasons for disrupted sleep cycle.Here are a few solutions for quickly recovering from jet lag:Fasting to reset sleep cycleblue light and sunlight to help you stay awakebinaural beats and/or guided hypnosispower naps I'm not sure if these qualify as "life hacks," and "quick" may be subjective, but these are some relevant methods that I recall of from popular news sources regarding sleep at least.
How to use the end of a squeezy tube?
With tubes such as the one in your photo, I just switch hands when the tube stops dispensing. That is, if I normally squeeze a tube with my right hand, then I switch to my left hand when I can't squeeze out any more of its contents. This technique probably doesn't ensure that I use up every last drop in the tube, but I can often delay buying a replacement for a week or two.

Bathtub decals peeling off in short time
Normally I wouldn't advocate against using a lifehack, but be wary of using anything that would make these decals truly permanent. While there are definitely ways to keep these from coming up, they might work so well that if you went to sell your house/get your security deposit back on your apartment you could get stuck paying for a new bath tub if there is residue left behind....Perhaps you would better off financially in the long run simply buying higher quality tub decals...Source: I own and am renovating fixer upper, and permanent bathroom decorations knocked 5 figures off the house price.
Stop free-roaming dogs from entering my property
There is no effective, legal way to do this.  It's a problem older than Animal Control, leash laws (or equivalent), possibly as old as domestication of dogs.  If you don't want to start a war with your neighbors, the only thing you can do without a fence is install an automatic camera so you can identify the dog to Animal Control.  This is moderately expensive and only a little effective (many locations have cut Animal Control budgets to the point of having only a single officer for a county and no maintenance budget for equipment).Best I can suggest is bite the bullet and put up a high, sturdy fence.  The saying is so old the English version is a translation from either Latin or Greek (not sure which): "Good fences make good neighbors."

There are some sound based cat deterrent items, which may also work against dogs.A short internet search showed Cat Repellent, Mega sonic cat repellent, Ultrasonic Cat deterrent, and several more.They have different settings for different animals, when mentioned dogs are always in the list.Some emit sound all the time, others only when an animal is detected.With the information of those sellers you can make your own, with a speaker that emits a very high sound, keep it beyond what even children can hear if you have neighbours with kids.If you are smart with machines you might even be able to have it work only when a camera detects a dog in the area.

Try bitter apple spray. It's a dog deterrent typically used to prevent chewing but I bet if you put it in a sprayer (like the ones used for weed spray) and went around the perimeter it would discourage them. Bitter apple spray is not toxic to dogs, just doesn't taste/smell good to them.Source: kept my puppy from eating my stairs, my dining room trim, coffee table, etc.

Motion activated sprinklers deter everything, are non lethal, and their effects easy to localize.Lowe's has an "Orbit Yard Enforcer Motion-Activated 1600-sq ft Sprinkler" for less than $20USD.You mention snow, and for obvious reasons this solution isn't suitable when temperatures get below freezing.  Even with this limitation, keep in mind that it won't be below freezing forever and if you start training the dogs/cats/raccoons/girlscouts as soon as the weather warms up, they will remember the unpleasant effects and continue to avoid the area next winter.
How can I effectively patch up holes in insect screen?
The fastest way is to use duct tape on both sides of the tear.The "normal" way to repair a screen is cut a patch from fresh screen and then weave it over the tear using wire thread. A curved needle with a fairly large eye is needed for this.

From Natural Products to Stop Dogs From Pooping in the YardNo one wants to step in pile of dog poop. If a canine is a member of  your family, poop piles are expected. But with the aid of some natural  deterrents, you can encourage pooping in certain areas of the yard. If  poop in your yard comes from neighborhood dogs, these same deterrents  can help. Natural products provide a safe alternative to harsh  chemicals and are typically safe around children as well. White dog  waiting on a driveway in suburban neighborhood Small dog standing  beside yard credit: Nuli_k/iStock/Getty Images All-Natural Commercial  Dog Repellent ProductsOutdoor commercial deterrents are available at your local pet supply,  grocery or hardware stores. These products use natural ingredients  that are safe for animals as well as for any vegetation in your yard.  They repel dogs through an unpleasant odor, taste or feel. They  typically come in granules or sprayable liquids, and they produce an  unpleasant scent that helps keep dogs from pooping in the area. The  downside to these is that the scent lasts for a only few weeks, so  regular application, including after rain, is necessary. Mix Your Own  Homemade DeterrentsIf you do not want to purchase commercial products, your kitchen may  already have natural deterrents that will keep dogs from pooping in  your yard. Chili pepper, sprinkled around the area, irritates the skin  and noses of dogs, keeping them at bay. Other natural products that  have distinct odors that are very offensive to a dog’s sensitive nose  include ammonia and vinegar. Unfortunately, both of these can kill  vegetation if poured directly on them. Soak cotton balls with vinegar  or ammonia and place the cotton balls throughout your yard. As with  commercial deterrents, homemade deterrents need regular application.  Apply Alternative LandscapingIf you are looking for a long-term deterrent, alternative landscaping  is an option. Certain plants, such as aloe, holly and berry vines,  have sharp edges and thorns that a dog will not want to venture  through. Pine cone mulch provides a rough surface that may be too much  for a dog’s feet. In terms of scent deterrents, the Coleus canina  plant, also known as “Dogs Be Gone" or "Scaredy Cat,” gives off an  offensive odor that keeps most animals out. The smell of this plant is  described as that of licorice or nicotine, and sometimes like skunk  scent. Water as a Natural DeterrentAnother natural deterrent stops dogs from pooping in your yard and  waters your foliage at the same time. Two watering options include  changing your watering schedule and sensor sprinklers. If you have a  regular stray dog that seems to take regular bathrooms breaks in your  yard, consider making that dog's time of day your watering time. The  offending dog will not want to venture in and get wet. Motion-detector  sprinklers work well. Place them in areas you want to keep poop-free.  When an animal approaches, the sensor turns a sprinkler on. This  startles the dog, gets him wet, and sends him on his way. Other  motion-activated devices emit high-pitched sounds or bursts or air  instead of water to deter animals that venture close.
Stop free-roaming dogs from entering my property
I would like to see Snopes take on this one. Reported on line as being used in Los Angeles, I have actually seen in in Melbourne, Australia. I couldn’t believe my eyes as I walked down a nice suburban street, with single homes, each with a neatly manicured front lawn – each with a plastic Coke bottle, filled with water, standing at each corner. I asked my cousin (a native) what in Hades was going on and she just shrugged and said nonchalantly, “yeah, keeps the dogs form crappin’ on yer lawn, dunnit?”I BEG you to run a scientific test of this and let us know if it works.[Update] after a little research, Docotr Greenfingers attempes to explain it:Ever wondered why people put bottles on there  lawns? You may have  been told its to keep cats away and its true. But does it work and  how? First of all we must half fill a clear plastic bottle with water   .( Its very important to fill half full of water. ) Put lid on and  place in the middle of the lawn. If you have a big lawn then put a few  about. Leave out and see if it works! Cats are suppose  to be scared  away by the bottle, but how you ask? It works best at night and if  there a breeze. Take a light say from a street lamp, car or one of  your windows. This light travels through the bottle and the water  which is then reflected away like laser beams in different directions  giving off little flashes. The cat sees these flashes and Zap! He's  away. There you have it so go out and try it out on your lawn.OTOH, Cats Away declares it to be a myth.And the Snopes jury is out - undetermined.Please, for the sake of humainity, you have to conduct experiemnts and report back to us.

There are chemical animal repellents that you can spray that might work.  The active ingredient is methyl nonyl ketone, which is found in a number of edible plants and has a strong smell somewhat reminiscent of cilantro.  I've only ever used it indoors, so I don't know how well it would wear outside.As far as its effectiveness, well, YMMV.  It made my cats sprint out of the room, but my dogs just rolled around in it.
How do I effectively remove dog hair from carpets?
Buy a better hooverIf your hoover can't get pet hair out, you need one more suited to the job at hand. A Miele C2 Cat 'n' Dog is my personal recommendation, but other specially designed pet hair models from good quality manufacturers will also do the job. You may feel that this is overkill but you will be removing pet hair repeatedly if you continue to use your current vacuum cleaner whereas spending around £200 (YCMV) on a quality pet hair vacuum cleaner will get it out easily day after day with less effort than alternative methods and do it easily over your whole floor.
How to quickly recover from jet lag?
Here is what worked for me well on frequency east-coast to China travel (12 or 13 hours depending on season). The thing that you really want to avoid is being wide awake at 3am in the morning. Try to pick flights that arrive in the afternoon or early evening. Early morning arrivals are terrible.Try to stay awake in the plane. Work, watch movies, read. If you get really tired, take a catnap.  Stay active and awake until it's "normal" bed time in the new location. A few beers and a nice dinner can help this along. At this point you had a really long day and should be bone tired. Out cold in 5s.I still may wake up at 3 am but tend to be tired enough to just turn around and fall asleep again.Switch to "normal" wake up and bed times right away. No transition, no day time naps. Just pretend that there is no jet leg and keep busy.

You are trying to alter your body's circadian rhythm to match an altered day/night time period.  The ways you can do this are shown below. Apply these methods to help yourself sleep or wake as needed to match the current day/night.To make yourself sleepy:Consume Melatonin (regulates circadian rhythm)Consume Tryptophan (Parmesan or cheddar cheese; metabolizes to serotonin and melatonin)Avoid bright light (at least 2 hours prior to bed)Perform normal night time rituals (shower, read in bed, ect.)Not recommended: Consume general depressants (alcohol, sleeping pills)To wake yourself up:Consume (preferrably complex) carbohydrates (bread, cereal)Consume stimulants: Caffeine, TaurineExerciseExpose yourself to bright light (blue or white works best)Links:MelatoninTryptophanTaurineWhen to apply bright light
How to quickly recover from jet lag?
Seems a solution to this would be similar to the age-old problem of a cure for the common cold :-)I've only ever done transatlantic (10 hours difference). What has worked for me is:Tough it out and stay awake at all costs until your normal bed time at the destination (provided that you may need an hour or two extra to completely recover from the added fatigue, so have some leeway in the waking time the first day or two). I avoid stimulants (like caffeine) and soporifics (sleeping tablets).Other things you might try (combine with above):Wear yellow or orange glasses (cheap safety goggles should do) 2-3 hours before bedtime. These are supposed to cut out UV and blue light wavelengths. While melatonin is constantly produced, this is also destroyed in the presence of light of wavelengths smaller than about 530 nanometers (which is abundant during the day, and also from LED lighting, some fluorescents, as well as phone/laptop screens etc.). The yellow/orange shades cut out these and simulate dawn, at which time melatonin buildup can commence, and produce sleepiness at a sufficient high level.Your body also needs sufficient ingested tryptophan (or 5-HTP) as a building block from which to produce first serotonin and from this melatonin (ingested melatonin itself supposedly can not reach your brain due to the blood-brain-barrier). Others have mentioned this, but an additional important aspect to this is that tryptophan (a small amino acid molecule) is difficult to get past the blood-brain-barrier and difficult to get into the appropriate cells. It seems that some carbohydrates together with your tryptophan-rich foods produce some insulin, which is helpful in this regard.You could try to start this on the flight, but of course the plane's meal/snack routine, lighting and noise (and general inability to sleep in those awful seats) may not be helpful.Caveat: Since we're talking about endocrinology one should point out that not everything works the same for everybody, peoples' internal chemistry can differ widely. Your mileage may vary and all that.Some other reading:Wikipedia: Circadian rhythm

How do I prop up a laptop screen with a broken hinge?
Both of my hinges have broken. I am about to order replacements.For a temp fix, I have: black duct tape from the top left of the screen to the surface of my laptop's supporting table (or to anything that it will stick to, behind it), and tape from the top right of the screen to the front right of the base of the laptop. These opposing tapes keep it fixed upright (again, this is temp), and they do not block the screen, although it is awkward getting to the numeric keypad on the right. You will probably want to test the angle you need before affixing the two tape strips.

If the key is just missing (not being damaged still there) you might find a replacement key in a shop where they recieve old keyboards.Like in shops where they refurbish used computers or where they put together several old computers to make one usable one.Or you might be able to order one online, if you search on your make of keyboard.Sometimes other keys fit, as long as the bottom of the key is identical, and you can scrape off the text (if any) on the top.This question from over in Arts and Crafts might show you what you need to know about the under side of the keys.Two main versions shown, there are more different ones around.There is an other solution, if you have a key on your keyboard you never use, you can switch the function of the keys.I do not remember how, but I am pretty sure the help function on your computer should help you find it. 'Repurpose keys' I would look for.Depending on the layout of your keyboard and the country you are in/the language you use.On my keyboard I might use the one with ~ and `, or the one with | and \   If you repurpose your missing key for the one you repurpose, you can still use that set of characters with your pencil.

How to empty a sponge of its soap?
A chemist once told me the answer to this but I have to confess I've never tested it. Apparently, "real" soap and other non-soap detergents work by completely different mechanisms which are contradictory.

I lost my equals key. now what?
I had an issue on a business trip with the b key on my laptop's built-in keyboard refusing to work. I didn't have an external keyboard with me, and I was working. A LOT. For me, working means taking notes in meetings, writing up plans, sending emails, writing code -- typing, typing, typing.I opened an existing document and copied a lower case b into my clipboard buffer, then pasted it into a notepad document I just kept open. I also did an upper case one. Then I just basically lived my regular life, using Ctrl-V to paste the b in wherever I might need to paste it. Type the first half of a word, paste the b, type the rest of the word. (Copy and paste from notepad, not from Word, because you don't want to paste any formatting, surrounding spaces, or other "helpful" features.) If I needed to do a normal copy-and-paste, I could flip back to the open file and get the b into the buffer again afterwards. At one point I was projecting my laptop and taking notes with this technique, and it wasn't until I had to re-get the b into the buffer that the other people had any idea I was doing it. (You get quick in a hurry if you do something enough.)This technique should carry you until you can replace your keyboard, or at least get an external one you can connect.
How to effectively remove cat hair from clothes (e.g. T-shirts) of thin cotton?
A lint roller (adhesive tape on a roller with a handle) would not work well because of the stretchiness of the t-shirt fabric and the stickiness of the adhesive tape.  However, there are other adhesive surfaces that might work.You could flatten out Silly Putty, press it on the shirt, and the hairs would get stuck in the SP when you peel it off. It also wouldn't stick to your shirt's fabric very strongly. However, Silly Putty is expensive, and wouldn't cover much surface area, so it would not be cost effective.You could also get a roll of contact paper (a.k.a. shelf liner), which should not be too expensive but should have a lot of square footage.  Cut off a section the size of your shirt, peel off the backing, press your shirt onto it, and peel it off slowly. The hairs should stick the the paper and get drawn out of your shirt fabric.

I have removed most of cat hair, but not all, with a wet sponge. It also works on sofas and carpets, but again, it does not remove the hair completely, only the major part.

How do get in habit of wearing glasses
Incorporate putting on your glasses into your morning routine. I.e. put them on first thing in the morning, and don't take them off until you go to bed. 
What can I do about folded edges in tea towels after washing?
I suggest you give a hot water wash as follows:Launder the dishcloth as usual and let them fully dry.Fill a kitchen pot with water and set it over HIGH heat on the stove. When it reaches boiling point, add 1/2 cup white vinegar to the water.Now add your rags to this solution.Boil for a few minutes to kill odors and bacteria along with to unfold the foldings.Allow to cool completely.Take out each cloth well and hang on a cloth drying rack or coat hanger to dry.The better one will be drying under sun.Though this solution can remove cloth folds, ultimate solution can be derived only after observing further information that is to shared by question raiser.
How to effectively remove cat hair from clothes (e.g. T-shirts) of thin cotton?
I suggest you could follow both the steps shown below:Dry your T-shirt in sun. After a warm dry, spread out a paper on your floor. Now shake your t-shirt rapidly so that newtons first law of motion is applied(Everybody will continue in its position unless it is acted upon by an external unbalanced force). During this, some hair will fall on you too. But most of them will fall on the paper distributed on the floor. Afterward, you can clean the area by packing up hair on paper spread out.You can use Vacuum cleaner. Spread out your t-shirt on a table. Now try out a vacuum cleaner on it.
How can I effectively patch up holes in insect screen?
You could do two hacks for this issue as a solution but it depends on the size of the hole.If the size is very much small, you can surely go for this. You could arrange a used bubble gum(for this, you itself can have one and use the same afterward). Enlarge it using your fingers so as it fits the holes size. Then fit over the hole. Afterward, you could wash off your hands and let the patch dry for 1 day. Patched bubble gum will become a good obstruction for insects in terms of its material after a good dry. Furthermore, if this hole gets the attraction, you can color it with fabric paint to suit the entire insect screen. You can use this solution if the patch is not a hole but a long cut. Arrange steel wire like this.I do not know the exact name of this, but you can use this to tie and make anything stay strong. You could hold back the two section of insect screen that is peeling off because of cut. If you see it awkward, you could insert the same as a design on both ends. 
How to effectively remove cat hair from clothes (e.g. T-shirts) of thin cotton?
We also have a cat, so I'm speaking from experience:Prevention - you don't need to get off what didn't get on your clothes in the first place.Brush your cat regularly. If he's not used to it, start with just a few strokes with a brush while petting him and reward his patience, e.g. with a small treat. Every hair that's in a brush won't get shed elsewhere. If you have a cooperative outdoor cat, brushing outside is even better.  Vacuum regularly. Not only the floors, but also the places you and your cat share, like the sofa. Sitting on cat hair causes them to get embedded in the fibers of your clothes.Some people swear by fabric softener to reduce electrostatic effects and thus less "clingy" hair. As I personally don't use it, I can not confirm its effectiveness, but at least for fabrics with partly synthetic fibers it sounds logical.Avoid embedding cat hair into the fibers as much as possible, so make your wardrobe / closet / laundry basket / pile of clothes... off-limits for your feline companions. Once they sleep on the clothes, they'll literally "rub the hair in".Do not wash clothes with cat hair on them. It might be tempting to "have the washer and dryer deal with them", but usually it causes them to get "felted" onto and into your t-shirt. Removal - a mix-and-match set of methods I used in the past.For copious amounts of hair (think shedding season), shaking out the shirt (outside!) will be a first step.If you use a lint roller or other tool, I find it easiest to use it while I wear the shirt. It seems to stretch less than when placed on a table or ironing board. Plus I don't want to spread cat hair everywhere. But in the long-term, they can be pretty pricey. I mostly use them for a quick touch-up. There are re-usable lint rollers on the market that have a permanently sticky rubber surface that can be rinsed off. They work reasonably well (but are less "strong" than the ones with tape), but are not suitable for large surfaces.Similar to the sticky rollers are rubber gloves. Not the thin chirurgical ones, but simple household gloves. Get them slightly damp, then wipe down your clothes. The hair should form little "rolls". Rinse the gloves as necessary.A very "hacky" approach is packing tape - and very cheap. Wrap some round your hand, sticky side out, then use it like a lint roller. What's nice is that you can somewhat adjust the strength by pressing harder or less hard, whatever fits your use case. And your hand will mold better to your body-shape than a rigid roller, so you need less going back-and-forth. Note that the "stickiness" can vary between brands, so some experimentation may be in order. Don't use duct tape or similar, especially for thin fabrics!Note that no tool or method will remove every single hair. You live with cats, that also means cat hair. You can drastically lower the amount, but if you really want to get rid of every single hair, there will always be a few that must be plucked off individually.
What can I do about folded edges in tea towels after washing?
Tea towels can be ironed, they will keep taking on water as usual.It is the teddy cloth towels that do not take up as much water when ironed.My solution is quite simple, as I hate ironing:Shake out the towel when it comes out of the washing machine, best if you can get it to make a whip sound.Then pull the fabric straight, with your hands to start and then you drag your edge over the edge of a table or even the washing machine. You do that from one corner to the next, with the first two inches/five centimeters being stretched and flattened on that semi-sharp edge.Hang to dry or put in the tumble dryer.When dry, repeat the shake, the pull and the drag over the edge of the table.This works best if you start with it when the towel is still new, as the creases will wear faster than the bits in between, making them more likely to stay.If you do iron other things, you can use the iron on just the edge of your tea towels. You will not use that first little bit for drying much, so even if it makes it taking water less easy, it will only be a small bit that is affected.And when you use that tea towel for drying dishes later, you can test whether it does change the amount of water it accepts.
How to get paint out of fabrics and jumpers?
I suggest you following methods for removing hard crust formed due to paint.Nail polish remover:If the paint spots are small and very less in number, you could use this, try to dilute the paint. Arrange one piece of waste cloth along with so that you can remove diluted paint using this. Ordinary paint removers can also work but I am not sure whether they could be applied on clothes. So found out a substitute for it.Ordinary wash but using hard brush: During the ordinary wash, you can use this type of brush that is having comparatively large spokes. Also take care while rubbing with this, because you should not worsen the situation.Dry cleaning: Since this one is the pretty costlier method if your fabric is that much sweet to you, you can finally resort to this solution. You can contact dry cleaners in your locality and sure, they will be able to tell how much paint can be removed by them. If they do not tell you about possible color change after wash, you should ask them before giving.
How to effectively remove cat hair from clothes (e.g. T-shirts) of thin cotton?
Thanks everyone for their answers.I realized that one of my problems was that I often first hand-washed my clothes, and only then removed remaining hair. I did this because I supposed some of hair to be removed by hand-washing. But, if fact, it just made cat hair to go deeper into the material.My current recipe (maybe not the best) is the following:Blind cleaning. While T-shirt is still dry, move wet hand/wet sponge over it. As for me, I don't like this step, because my vision doesn't allow to see cat hair precisely on dry material (but I can see it very well on wet material), so this step is actually to be done "blindly"; however, I realize that it still can be somewhat effective. Also, if there is a lot of hair on T-shirt, you can also shake it above a bathtub (not my case though, I usually had not much hair, but strongly-clanged).Sighted cleaning. Drench T-shirt (hair is much more visible on wet material). Remove cat hair fibers with your fingers one by one from both outer and inner sides of cloth (this is actually what I did before, but I did it after "step 3", which made it problematical).Washing. Wash your clothes as usually (hand-washing, machine washing, etc). Never do it before "step 2": not only soap and washing powder themselves don't remove cat hair, but also typical washing movements cause hair to penetrate deeper into the material.Check. While cloth is still wet, check it for not-noticed-yet hair. Repeat "step 2", if necessary.
Any other better leather conditioner alternatives?
The following can also be other substitutes:Beeswax-solid: Used for protection of leather. It creates a barrier for environmental influencesCoconut butter-semi solid: It conditions the leather surface.Sweet Almond oil-liquid: Softens the leather internally and replaces the natural oils lost through dyingCastor oil-liquid: This is heavier oil that provides the 'shine'. This could be replaced with mineral oil if necessary.
How to stop throwing blankets off myself while sleeping?
Lower your thermostat a few degrees during sleeping hours, so you don't get too warm under the blankets.  Then turn it back up for the morning -- or, if it's a modern thermostat, program the settings for sleeping hours (and while you're away for school or work) and save some money on heat.

How to trap houseflies? (what's the best bait?)
I don't know about houseflies in Uruguay, but here in the Netherlands I always put the following in the bottle trap:some honey (works even better if it's also smeared on the 'walls' of the bottle)about 2-3 cm of vinegar (I use apple vinegar, but I think any would work)a drop of dishwashing liquid (it prevents the flies from floating in the surface tension)In the past summer I've mostly been bothered by fruit flies, and I caught a buttload of them. But I've also caught a couple of houseflies that were bothering me, this way.

How to stop throwing blankets off myself while sleeping?
I don't want to turn this into WebMD but I think your question should be treated as more than a life hack. I would consult with a doctor since what you are experiencing sounds like a reaction to something else. To quote Dr. Rosenberg "There are many reasons for tossing and turning. These include sleep apnea, chronic pain, periodic limb movement and acid reflux to name a few. Others include the bedroom environment being too warm or having too much light. In addition, excessive alcohol, caffeine and heavy meals before bed can lead to restless sleep."Maybe explore the cause rather than "hack" it. Hope this helps :) 
What's the most time efficient way to completely clean teeth?
There is a 3D printed toothbrush to brush your teeth in 6 seconds. It must be custom molded as it contains all the bristles necessary to simultaneously brush every tooth in parallel.I don't think they have done the necessary clinical trials to address skepticism that it is fully equivalent to 2 minutes of manual brushing, so it may be a risky way to try to meet the twice daily recommended minimum in only 12 seconds. But it might be a reasonable risk as a partial replacement to get the benefits of brushing 5 times a day in 4 minutes, 18 seconds instead of 10 minutes.

How to share food fairly with three people?
Have the first person cut off an estimated 1/3, the second person divides the remainder in half, and the third person get first pick, then the second person get second pick.If the first makes the "1/3" piece too big or too small, then the second and third people would choose the larger slices, so the first person will make a good effort to slice just 1/3.If the second divides unevenly, then the third would get a larger share, so the second will strive to make the division equitable.
How to remove rotten meat odour from the fridge?
I suggest you follow these steps:(During these process, please check fridge is not working)First, you can remove the meat from fridge to a trash bin or to a carrier and then, trash bin.You could search in the kitchen to find out a dishwasher like this. I suggest you have the one that is strong in odor.(I am not branding product, please find a substitute in your local market)Take some drops of it in a container, add some water and dilute its concentration.With a clean cloth, dip it in this solution and apply it to space in the fridge where the meat was kept.Let it dry for few minutes.-You could use a dry piece of cloth to wash that applied solution away.Even after this, if the odor exists, then you could use the lemon spray as shown:
How to trap houseflies? (what's the best bait?)
I suggest you cut that banana, immerse into honey and keep it wide open in the setup you have made. Another method is as follows:Find a suitable can.Cut out lengths of duct tape, wind around the can without touching the sticky ends, or getting them dirt, otherwise, the trap will not work.Wrap the lengths around the can and press the tape tightly against the can with your hands. A gentle rub is ok.Remove the duct tape from the can so that the surface of the can will now be sticky. You can test to see how sticky it is. If it is not very sticky, repeat with new lengths of duct tape.Tape a small flashlight to the bottom of can, if you can find a UV flashlight, it will be great as flies are mostly attracted to UV light.Put the can at place where you require, leave it for a night.Replace the can with another one and use the entire steps again. Though another answer also used light, I do not support collecting flies in a freezer so I am improving it with another suitable substitute.
How to remove rotten meat odour from the fridge?
Use this occasion to properly clean your fridge. As different microorganisms need different conditions to grow, first use baking soda disolved in water to kill acidic thriving bacteria and fungi.After you rinse the residues from baking soda, clean the fridge with vinegar to kill alkaline thriving microorganisms.Let the door of the fridge open for half an hour to allow the inside to dry because high humidity helps microorganisms to grow.The smell of vinegar will be gone in a few days.

How to trap houseflies? (what's the best bait?)
Here's a trick for you, provided you are talking about regular flies.Most answers mentioned a food source. Let's try something else that also attract flies: LightFlies are attracted to light and will fly toward light sources when their surroundings become dark. Here is what I have had a lot of success with: Be sure you can create total darkness in the house and only produce light where you want to catch the flies. At night, clear out or line the freezer with paper or plastic, then, gradually turn on and off lights around one by one to lure the flies closer to the fridge. Then turn off all light source and open the freezer. If your freezer does not have a light, put a flashlight in there, point it inward. In a couple minutes, you will get all the flies in there. Close the freezer for a minute. All the flies will have dropped frozen and not yet dead. Remember, clear out and/or line your freezer. They flies won't get to land anywhere. They'll freeze and drop into your plastic or paper.You can then collect them, do what you want with them. Feed the frogs, throw them out to nature, or flush them away.The same light concept can be used without the freezer. You can use a tube, a large, empty soda bottle, a water jug, so long as you make the light lure really tightly controlled so that it's the only light source. Spread sticky glue around the walls & you will get a jug full of flies.Have fun! 
What is the best hack to remove bubbles?
Even high-quality sweaters and warm clothes produce bubbles which makes them look old and worn out. This is usually due to washing and due to ageing. I would suggest you do not use any machines for this problem.Use a razor: This is used currently in laundry. Electric or battery operated razor is not required. A use and throw type known as a disposable razor would be sufficient. Take care while using otherwise, it may cut your woolen clothes.Use a pumice stone: Easily available hack for this in the market. Rub it on your woolen clothes and see the hack solving easily.Use a sand paper: The second easily available hack in shops. Rub it in a single direction and hack works.Whenever you wash your woolen clothes, always remember to wash them in detergents or conditioners made especially for them and not the washing powder available for washing fabrics of cotton, silk or other varieties.Also remember that Proper and tender care can keep your woolen clothes new for years together.
What is the quickest way to de-carbonate a drink
My girlfriend stirs her drink with a raw wooden spoon. This can also work with a bamboo stick but since it has less surface area, it takes a little longer. It's still quick enough, after about 3-4 stirs it will be completely decarbonated. A warning, however, don't fill your glass to the top, because when decarbonating, it creates bubbles and there's a chance the glass will overflow. I couldn't believe how well it worked the first time I tried it. I don't know exactly why it works so well, so if someone can explain it, please do.
How to share food fairly with three people?
If you are having a dinner party, setting up the food yourself on the plates with a good presentation and then serve it can be another solution. A nice presentation will make the guests happy. If you have leftovers, make sure the guests feel welcome to take seconds if they want. This avoids the problem with the third being polite and not taking an equal size as the others so as to leave nothing left. 
How to share food fairly with three people?
This answer is based on the answer from @Paparazzi, but should work well in all situations if there is no collusion between persons A and B.A cuts off a piece.B either takes the piece, or forces A to take it.The two remaining people who don't yet have a piece do the standard two-person splitting as described in the original question.A will try to cut exactly 1/3 of the original.  If he cuts less, he is stuck with it.  If he cuts more, B gets it.

How to share food fairly with three people?
Preface:DrMoishe Pippik's currently top answer — cut A, B, C; pick C, B, A — does not work because you have to define "fair" as each player either cuts 1/3 to the best of their ability (or maybe accepts less), or the glutton/cheater is going to lose out.In the top answer, let's say #1 cuts exactly 1/3 (as they should). If #2 cuts a tiny sliver (the bad actor), #3 will select their larger piece, so #2 takes #1's third… and #1 is left with the tiny sliver. FAIL!So here's a "game" that worksRemember the solution for two people is that one person cuts the portion in half, and the other person gets to pick which one they keep. It's 100% "fair".You can use that premise to create four slices (half and then half again) but the players only keep three of the slices… and divide up the remaining 1/4th in a similar fashion. So here's the order:#1 cuts, #2 chooses (the whole becomes 50-50%)#2 cuts their half, #3 choose (that half becomes 25-25%)#3 cuts the other half, #1 chooses (that half becomes 25-25%)Set that last remaining 25% aside and repeat the sequence on the remainder.After two iterations, the leftover piece will be only 1/16 the original size.After three iterations, the leftover piece will be only 1/64th.You either can keep going and live in an infinite-sequence mathematical hell, or just decide the remaining crumbs are too small to be consequential and eyeball it. Bonus: This is impossible to cheat, collude, or game. You can even accept less than your share (intentionally) if you're not all that hungry. 
How to share food fairly with three people?
Being the youngest in a family with four kids, we had a lot of sharing and often enough just between three if one of us was not there.We always had one cutting and then the others chose.The chosing would be in random order if the cutting had been done fairly in our opinion. If we were not satisfied we would insist on a draw (straws or hidden number) to get the order of chosing or we would insist on further cutting to get the parts more equal.We would never go to the effort of two people cutting, if you did cut that bad you would be boo'ed, rediculed and told to do a better job next time. In the worst cases you would be told to make a few more cuts to devide better.If the people sharing are all adults and the sharing will be just once, you can do the #1 cuts first, #2 cuts second and #3 choses first.But when teaching kids living together, better teach them from the start to cut as good as they can and pick wisely.
Removing soot and smoke smell after a house fire
Not sure if our pics are visible, but here goes. We bought a house on auction that previously had arson set to it. Almost a 100%gut! However...the areas we could save, we did. We used a primer called BIN which is shellac-based and seals in ALL odors in walls or surfaces that are paintable. Use tons of ventilation with BIN! Dry chemical sponges were a bust. Don't  waste your money. We used tons of vinegar, alternated with Dawn dishwashing soap.  Much elbow grease was required. Now  we have a beautiful, smoke-free home to show for it.  I also have heard that ozone machines are great for furniture, etc. I've heard you have to use them sometimes multiple times for it to have a full effect. 
How to share food fairly with three people?
Let one of them to try cutting ⅓ out of pie (let's call that part α and remainder βγ).Two others vote by saying either "α is really smaller than or equal to ⅓", or "α is really larger than or equal to ⅓" (if a voter thinks that α=⅓, he's free to choose any variant).Then:If both said α≤⅓: The "cutter" takes α, two others share βγ.If one said α≤⅓ and other said α≥⅓: The latter takes α, the former shares βγ with the "cutter".If both said α≥⅓:The "cutter" tries to cut ⅓ (of original size) again, but now out of βγ (let's call that part β and remainder γ).Two others vote for either "β≤⅓", or "⅓≤β≤α", or "α≤β".Then:If both said β≤⅓: The "cutter" takes β, two others share αγ.If one said β≤⅓ and other said α≤β: The latter takes β, the former takes α, the "cutter" takes γ.Otherwise: The "cutter" takes γ, others share αβ.This is actually more puzzle solution, than for real life.Unlike Robert Cartaino's answer, this procedure is not recursive: maximum 3 cuts are done.Whey I say that some two share something, I mean the standard cut-then-choose between them.And, as Anthony Joseph said, there are some researches on fair cake-cutting problem in game theory. Neither the my procedure above, nor the standard cut-then-choose (for two participants) are ideal. Maybe better to ask at Mathematics with Game Theory tag (or is it too simple for them)? Also there exists Surplus procedure (Wikipedia article, direct link).
What is a permanent solution for black mold?
Many mold killing products contain chemicals. These chemicals can be allergenic, bad for the environment, and bad for your family and pets.Vinegar, on the other hand, is a natural acid. Vinegar is totally non-toxic and safe of course. You can drink it, afterall. Vinegar is also biodegradable and fine for the environment.Although vinegar leaves a strong smell, the fumes are not harmful at all.It is very cheap to buy vinegar. You can easily find bottles of white vinegar in the supermarket.
How to share food fairly with three people?
Have A split into thirds.Have B and C each rank the pieces by size.There are several possibilities:B and C agree on everything, A gets what they think is smallest piece, B and C divide-and-choose the rest.B and C disagree on largest piece, each gets piece they think is largest, A gets the remaining piece.B and C agree on the largest piece, but disagree on the other two, B and C divide-and-choose the one they think is largest, B and A divide-and-choose the one B thinks is second largest, C and A divide-and-choose the one C thinks is largest.In case one, A can't complain, because A believes the pieces are equal, B and C can't complain either, because they each believe they got at least half of what they believe is at least two thirds.In case two, A can't complain because A believes the pieces are equal, B and C can't complain because they each got the piece they believe is the largest.In case three, A can't complain, because A got a fair share of two pieces, and A believes them to all be equal, B can't complain, because B got a fair share of what B believes to be at least two thirds, and C gets the same deal as B, so C can't complain.
I lost my equals key. now what?
Way #1:Get somewhere another keyboard with similar button shapes/sizes. Not necessarily new (it may be used by somebody else). Not necessarily working — you need just a "donor" of 1 button.You can use forums/sites popular in your area to find that garbage. It should be relatively cheap (unless you have very rare keyboard with very specific button shapes). You can even publish announcement/post yourself ("I'll buy broken keyboard with specific button sizes for <specific price, small, but adequate for your area>") instead of searching within list of already published propositions.If your have friends, working as system administrators or something like that, then you even have a chance to get one for free. As, due to specifics of their work, they have access to lots of broken hardware. Any non-functioning keyboard will probably have no value for them, but can act as "donor" for your keyboard.Try using social networks.Try pulling some button from a "donor" keyboard and inserting into yours.You may need to repeat 1-2 several times, as similarly looking keyboards not necessarily have identical button shape and mechanism.Way #2: Try crafting the button (or a surrogate) yourself. Probably the hardest way, even if you have access to 3D-printers or some other helpful equipment; at least if you want "real" button. But still theoretically possible. Also, I don't know mechanism of your keyboard, so I can't say anything more concretely. If the spring is still inside, it may be enough just to put a piece of eraser (or other easy-cut material) of a proper size on the top of it to avoid using a pencil.

How do I remove this lock?
In this situation, I put forward following hacks possible:If you had noted down its key number, Masterlock would be able to help you with creating spare keys for that lock.Find out a locksmith to unlock the lock.Maybe your local police could offer the better suggestion as thieves are expert in unlocking them and police could have learned better hacks from them.Another option is to buy a universal "pick" which claims to be able to open any lock with a round keyhole in seconds. I'm not sure where you can obtain such picks from or if they actually work.As a last resort, I would suggest you go for the angle grinder.It will take around 10 minutes to cut the lock.
Changing a smoke detector battery with a too-short ladder
If you could search for this product on your neighborhood, it would be great that you can borrow it for this purpose. I would suggest you purchase a similar one and keep it in store as you will have to face this problem frequently for other smoke detectors.If your smoke detectors are at the center of room, of course you could confuse yourself as how to use this ladder. In that situation either you can search for any obstacle in the room that would obstruct this ladder from gliding away along with your weight or you could tighten the ladder between two floors so that it wont move even if you enter on it.If you are not getting one such ladder, then you could search for obstacles that are stern to keep the ladder that you have on it so that you reach the ceiling. Please do call a second person as this way does not give you much grip to hold and fully depends on your balance.
How do I remove this lock?
My experience (using and repairing these tools on a daily basis) is that a $20 angle grinder from Harbor Freight with a "slicing wheel" mounted is far easier to hold steady than a (usually more expensive) rotary tool, and either one will require a second person to steady the lock.  However, the big problem with any powered abrasive cutter is the shower of sparks the wheel will throw.An option that will still deposit abrasive particles and metal filings near the cut, but at least won't throw them across the room after igniting them (and hence possibly start a fire in bedclothes, curtains, etc.) is a "rod saw" or tile cutting blade mounted in a hacksaw frame.  These carbide abrasive blades will cut nearly anything (including glass and tile, and surely including the lock's shackle), but being muscle powered won't heat the filings from the shackle to ignition.  Yes, it'll take a long time to cut through a hard shackle this way -- but this will do the least damage to the bedroom.One additional advantage of a rod saw or abrasive edge hacksaw blade is that the cuttings won't come out of the cut at high velocity.  Temperature aside, this would absolutely required eye protection be worn by everyone assisting in the operation.  Such protection is a good idea, but not a fast requirement, with a low speed abrasive cutter like a rod saw.

How do I remove this lock?
I can't see them well enough or know how the lock works to be certain but could you use a shim? This is a little bit of metal (cut from a drink can) that you can slide between the pin that holds the cuff closed and the cuff. Something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC-1S4cHUPs
I lost my equals key. now what?
This is likely completely over thinking this but you could 3d print one. I doubt you have a 3d printers but you might have a makerspace (also known as hackspaces) close by which is likely to have one. If you go along someone might design one for you or help you design one yourself (there might be one already designed like this one http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:468651), might cost more (the makerspace i go to is £5 per session and no other costs) than some other solutions but in my opinion it will be more fun.
Changing a smoke detector battery with a too-short ladder
I think this kind of ladder will be your best bet, as you can not get a tall ladder/stepladder in the lift nor are you allowed to get a ladder up on the outside of the building.(This as per deleted comments.)The ladder is one that can be bend in 4 short sections, which can be positioned as step ladder, as a platform and as a more traditional ladder.Likely you will not have to buy it, I bet they are for rent in many places.If this will not do the job, your best bet is to get someone in to do it for you, who can reach the alarm from the top rung of the step ladder you own.   Or someone who instals the allarms and might be able to exchange the battery operated one with one that works from the mains.
Changing a smoke detector battery with a too-short ladder
Proper Ladder Use and Injury PrecautionsA Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) report on ladder safety showed some startling statistics concerning the frequency and severity of ladder-related accidents in the United States. Every year thousands of people are injured and hundreds are killed. By understanding the causes of ladder accidents the vast majority could be prevented.More than 90,000 people receive emergency room treatment from ladder-related injuries every yearElevated falls account for almost 700 occupational deaths annuallyThese deaths account for 15% of all occupational deathsOSHA believes 100% of all ladder accidents could be prevented if proper attention to equipment and climber training were providedOver the last 10 years the amount of ladder-related injuries has increased 50%According the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 50% of all ladder-related accidents were due to individuals carrying items as they climbedThe most common type of ladder-related injury, with 32%, is fractures4 Main Types of Ladder AccidentsLadder accidents are extremely common even though they are entirely preventable. Ladder accidents can come from a wide variety of issues but the following four causes account for the vast majority. If these simple loss prevention tips for each cause are followed, ladder accidents could almost be eliminated.Selecting the Wrong Type of LadderLike most other jobs, choosing the right tool can make all the difference when it comes to safety and this is the same for ladders. One thing to consider when selecting an appropriate ladder is the ladder’s weight capacity. Each ladder is designed to support a maximum weight limit and if the climber exceeds that limit the ladder could break and cause the user to fall or become injured.Another consideration when selecting the appropriate ladder for a job is the necessary height of the ladder. Many injuries occur due to ladders being too short for a specific task, and instead of selecting a new ladder for the job, workers will place the ladder on something to extend its reach or will stand on the top rung to gain the necessary height. Both scenarios are extremely dangerous and can result in serious injuries.Using Worn or Damaged LaddersAnother common contributing factor to ladder accidents is the use of old, worn, or damaged ladders. Like everything else, ladders have a shelf life; after a couple of years the stress of being climbed up and down on causes ladders to break down. Damaged ladders are extremely dangerous as they can easily break while being used and cause serious injuries.To protect yourself from damaged or broken ladders, make sure to thoroughly inspect each ladder before using it. If any damage is found, do not use the ladder until it has been safely repaired to the manufacturer’s specifications or it has been replaced.Incorrect Use of LaddersHuman error is by far the leading cause of ladder accidents. Never use a ladder in any other way than what the manufacturer intended it to be used for. Also, do not lengthen or alter a ladder in any way.While using a ladder always maintain 3 points of contact with the ladder to ensure stability. Also, never attempt to reach for something while on the ladder. It is much safer to get off the ladder, move it, and then climb back up.Incorrect Placement of LaddersMake sure that when positioning a ladder, the ground you place it on is level and firm. Ladders should never be placed in front of a door that is not locked, blocked, or guarded.A good practice to ensure a ladder is secure is to always have a helper support the base while a ladder is being used. If the ladder can not be held by someone else, make sure it has an appropriate foot to prevent it from slipping. The feet of the ladder can be staked if you are using a ladder outside and no one is available to support the feet of the ladder.

How to get paint out of fabrics and jumpers?
You can use a fingernail to bust the crusted paint off, alternatively a meetal teaspoon will do. If you didnt treat it when wet, thats pretty much all you can do. Neat washing-up liquid might loosen the residue a little, worth a try
Changing a smoke detector battery with a too-short ladder
As it has been stated before without truly reading your request, a specific type of ladder is your best bet along with a "reach tool."  The "reach tool" for someone of your height would probably come in handy for many other tasks as well around your house.  Depending on where you live, many hardware stores rent ladders for a low couple hour fee.  Home Depot is a large name store that does for around $20-$25 for four hours.  I have this ladder at my home and when completely folded up it is only 6ft tall and does not require the support of a wall to reach 13ft.  For you being 5ft tall, this should be more than high enough for you to reach said smoke alarm.  The other part of this that you may need is the "reach tool".  Many hardware stores sell them as well as Amazon for $15-$20.  These will give you the additional three feet that you may require.
putting on jumper without twisting
The sleeves do twist if you do not hold them while putting your jumper on, or they move up so much that you can not easily pull them down. So hold your cuffs when you put your jumper on.You also seem to suffer from the body of your shirt not being right when you take your jumper off. That you can prevent with this:Tuck your shirt into your trousers (or your pants) and make sure those are a tight fit so the shirt does not work out.There is at least one website that teaches you how to tuck.Some places sell shirts in different lengths, you might need to buy one which is longer and stays better tucked in.If that is not enough, you can do as dancers do, and wear a shirt which is sewn onto underpants.

How to remove rotten meat odour from the fridge?
Alright, it is been more than a week and the fridge has been moved outside. The question was scoped to that day and while no one else at home.That day i tried to put any material that I heard of can discharge bad smell or atleast its smell is stronger than the rotten meat odour. And it is available on the house that time.I tried to insert listerine, camphor, and coffee. None of them can discharge the smell inside the fridge.But i found an interesting idea, instead of discharge the smell in the fridge, i better off discharge the smell of the room.So i put coffee on the floor (It is robusta coffee, an Indonesian coffee, . It is very famous with the strong of its smell). And in my room,i put the coffee on a bowl, and inflate it with a small fan, just to get the smell to fill the room.And it is work, I survived 3 night sleeping at my room.

How to remove the spots on my mirror
It looks like it is scale, which is build up chalk.As with all scale, vinegar and lemon juice, among other things, will get rid of it.Best option might be cleaning strength vinegar but all different kinds of vinegar as well as many kinds of lemon and lime juice will clean scale. I expect there are commercially made cleaners that will do the job, based on other accids as well as those I mention.For as strong build up as this I would use a bit of undiluted vinegar or lemon juice on a bit of cloth or paper and just rub it on, wash it off after with plenty of water.When using a commercial cleaner, follow instructions on the packaging. Some might be so much stronger that gloves are needed.If it was clear glass I would submerge it in a vinegar solution, but some mirror backings, some glues and some frame materials will not do well in that.To avoid a new build up, clean off your mirror after every use in which it gets wet. If the water where you live is hard (contains a lot of chalk) it might be needed to use a wipe with a bit of vinegar or lemon juice.  A lifehack to avoid water staying on the mirror is to wipe it with a little soap. Just a tiny bit, and wipe it off with a dry cloth or piece of paper.This can be any kind of soap and it has to be a very little bit. Just drag a wet finger over a block of soap and use that little, or use the bit of liquid soap that is still on the dispenser after using it.
How to stop throwing blankets off myself while sleeping?
I had the same problem, until I moved to Europe and discovered the duvet!. A duvet is like a comforter except that it has a cover that you launder. And the cover is typically made of the same type of fabric as sheets are, s it's comfortable against your skin.Although you can have both a top sheet and a duvet, many people don't. I just use the duvet in place of a top sheet, because if I used both, the duvet might slide off when I turn over. Because there's just one layer, I find it easy to keep it on me while I sleep.I find that a duvet helps me to stay at a comfortable temperature throughout the night. When the room is warm, I let the duvet just drape loosely over me. When it's cold, I pull the duvet tightly around me. I even do this (pulling it around me or leaving it loose as needed) in my sleep; it's instinctive.
How to bandage my finger tip with an ulcer?
Perhaps instead of a bandage, a finger splint (you can find them at a pharmacy) would work. There's a wide variety of them, so you should be able to find one that will protect the fingertip from bumps without putting pressure on it.
How to bandage my finger tip with an ulcer?
I would try a combination of a finger cot which is basically a single finger rubber 'glove' and a chusioning layer of soft fabric around it.Or, if it suits you better, have the soft fabric on the inside and the rubber in a bigger size on the outside.Finger cot as used on the Wikipedia page, full attribution here.I would fold a bit of teddycloth (like a towel) and sew both sides to make a one finger mitten and use that with the protection against getting wet. But any piece of cloth which is big enough can be wrapped around the finger in the way you find least painfull.If needed (likely) you will need a bit of sticky plaster to keep them in place but this will be much lower down the finger. And you can use different length of mits and gloves against each other to move the spot you need to attach the tape.In case you need the sturdy protection the other answers recomment, you can still use the finger cot to protect your finger from getting wet.Finger cots should be available from the same shops as plasters, or from (web)shops that supply work places that work with food, as they are often used to protect damaged fingers and food from each other.They come in several sizes, you might want to go for the bigger ones.
How to counteract the burning sensation after eating spicy food?
I used to be addicted to chilis when I was younger, nothing was ever spicy enough; however, I've been a bit ill lately and have become sensitive to many things, including chilis. I enjoy the taste but the skin on my lips, in my mouth, tongue and esophagus is too weak to handle the intense spicyness of certain chilis these days. I've learned that either you avoid them or you eat loads of rice or drink/eat something really creamy to help with the burn (I don't eat dairy so I usually opt for a bowl of steamed rice or a glass of soymilk or a soy yoghurt). The best stomach remedy would be some probiotics and Alka-Seltzer or the like. My grandma used to just mix a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda (not baking powder!) into a 1/2 glass of water and drink that every 2 to 4 hours, but no more than seven of these 1/2 glasses per day, per the instructions listed on the baking soda packages.   
How to keep bread fresher for longer
I don't put the bread in the freezer - but I store it in clean, dry ziplock freezer bags in a cool to cold place. However, I also use traditionally fermented sourdough-based breads and it makes a BIG difference. The money spent on bread like the one I described is of the same value considering the fact that I never need to throw it away because it lasts longer than the bread of lower quality. These types of breads are less likely to mold or go stale in such a short amount of time - it usually takes more than a week to start drying out or show any signs of deterioration.

How to do you maintain the hair in-between coarse and shampoo-smooth hair?
I have the same problem though my hair is fine (as in the the thickness of each individual strand). I think it is because shampoos can be harsh on the hair due to detergents and foaming agents that are also difficult to completely rinse out. Also, hair dryers can really aggravate and dry your hair out, so if you use one, try to use it on a lower setting or let your hair air-dry naturally (you can set it with rollers or twists/braids if you need to). I've been using milder and sometimes PH balanced shampoos in addition to an Apple Cider Vinegar rinse (mix 9 parts water with one part Apple Cider Vinegar) and my hair is much more manageable nowadays. You can put the rinse in a spray-bottle and saturate your hair or you can just pour it over your hair. You can choose whether you want to rinse it out or not - the smell fades as the hair dries. This rinse conditions and smooths/calms the hair, it also remedy's dandruff. I really don't need a conditioner when I do this either. Afterwards, I just wait until my hair is half dry but still damp, rub some olive oil between my palms to distribute (apply) throughout my hair (concentrating on the driest parts of my hair, such as the ends) to help restore the oil content loss during the shampooing process. During the week, When my hair begins to look limp or dry again after a few days, I dampen it again using a brush wet with water and then apply a tiny bit of olive oil to my ends again; but it is important to wash it within the next few days after that to avoid dirty hair. Good luck.
How to do you maintain the hair in-between coarse and shampoo-smooth hair?
Very simple, stop washing your hair.Rinse your hair every day or every other day and let it air dry.That is all you need.But do give it a couple of weeks if you are used to washing it with shampoo now.At first it will feel greasy, or plain dirty, but that is at least half your ideas about it. Comb (and with long hair brush) it every morning and evening, so the natural oils spread and coat the whole of the hair and do not stick at the roots.This will take care of dry ends as well.Then rinsing with lukewarm water (or your normal shower temperature) will get the exess off without soap.When you need your hair clean after it gets really dirty or when it is washed before cutting, the odd wash with shampoo will not hurt, but if you wash with shampoo for a few times running will lead to having to condition your hair for just rinsing again. (But as you are now used to it, you will not feel dirty anymore.)
How to counteract the burning sensation after eating spicy food?
Eat or drink milk and milk products like yoghurt, as mentioned before.If you are allergic or intolerant of dairy, most or all usual milk substitutes and their products will work as well.Coconut milk is often used in some of the Asian cuisines and fits very well with the kind of food.If you have a range, the low fat options will work less than the ones containing some or more fat.Also from own experience, eat bread or plain rice, or other plain food that is not spicy. Boiled potatos are often working, beans which are not mixed with sauce can do the trick.As can a mouth full of salad, specially if it also has some fat in the dresssing.
How can I repurpose dried out grains and beans?
A way to use them when they are without hope for use as food, baking beans to blind bake pastry.  blind baking with special beans, normal dry beans works as well.Picture from the page linked to above.

How can I keep my mouth closed while sleeping?
Sleeping on your back actually causes you to breathe heavier. The heavier you breathe, the less oxygen your nasal passages can let pass through. This results in your mouth opening up naturally. Also, make sure your room and blankets aren't too warm. That can also result in heavier breathing.

What is the best way of cleaning the glass on a wood burning stove?
I have found that ashes from the wood burning stove on a damp terry cloth or paper towel work wonders. Then take a second dry terry cloth or dry paper towel and wipe again.Another solution to the problem is using 'Nothings Better' which is a hard water stain remover. Just follow the directions on the container. 'Nothings Better' comes in dry and paste. The dry is what works best my wood burning stove.

How can I repurpose dried out grains and beans?
At first, if you have 2.2lb of rye berries, then I suggest you first find methods to store it without decay. Pointing out some rule of thumb for the same:Whole Intact Grains:  The shelf life of whole intact grains, like wheat berries or brown rice, is a bit longer than ﬂours.  If stored properly in airtight containers, intact grains will keep for up to 6 months on a cool, dry pantry shelf or up to a year in the freezer.  Whole Grain Flours and Meals:  In general, whole grain ﬂours spoil more quickly than intact grains, because their protective bran layer has been broken up and oxygen can reach all parts of the grain. If stored properly in airtight containers, most whole grain ﬂours and meals will keep for 1 to 3 months on a cool, dry pantry shelf or 2 to 6 months in the freezer.  You could surely try out one of these containers.Now if you have a lot of grains and beans that could not be re-used, then you can resort for the following:Depending upon its period of decay, you can decide upon whether it can be used for pet food production. Even though there are methods for this, I suggest you go behind this only after a thorough analysis about grain period.You could use it as kitchen waste for Gobar-gas plant if you have any. Advantage is that you get manure from it as by product.You can also use it for fertilizer production. But a serious of the process needs to be passed to transform it into fertilizer. Anyway, there are certain home based methods for it too. One such method is Vermicompost from kitchen waste. 
How can I contact Obama now that he's not in the White House?
I'd love to give a more general, more lifehack-esque answer, so I'll instead try to answer "how to save time when trying to contact former government officials".

How can I straighten a twisted necktie?
I have to reccomend a tie bar / tie clip as the best solution to (reproducibly, and with minimum effort) solve your problem. There are plenty of cheap examples available online, and they can range from quite plain and unobtrusive to the slightly more gaudy examples shown on wikipedia.(Credit to Willeke's answer, as they mentioned tie pins briefly.)
How do I remove this lock?
You need a short hook and a bogota lockpick. Master locks are so incredibly poorly manufacured that it typically takes 30-60 seconds to open one you don't know. Sparrows sells decent picks, but buy some cheaper used picks on eBay. For torque, you can take a generic windshield wiper insert and bend it 90° with a pair of pliers.A snapgun would work, but only if the keyway isn't too tight. Look at bosnianbill's videos on youtube. Edit: looked again, it appears to be a tubular cylinder. You need a short and medium hook for those, and a specific tension wrench for tubular locks. Sparrows sells these. Pick it three times in a star pattern, it will open. They are more inconvenient to pick than difficult. If you want it to be very simple it will cost you more, but requires no skill. See e.g. http://www.lockpicks.com/8-pin-advanced-tubular-pick.htmlAsk their support staff what kind of pick you need for this lock. No need to break what looks like a pair of very romantic handcuffs ❤
How to dry a champagne glass?
After rinsing as well as possible, do a final rinse with distilled or deionoized water, then hang or rack the glass upside down to dry (preferably in a low-dust location).  If you do the rinse correctly, there should be no dissolved solids left to leave spots on the glass, and no need to stick something inside the fragile flute.
How to dry a champagne glass?
I use a dry micro-fibre cloth [I do for many things]Use the 'fluffy' ones you can get from the supermarket - very cheap, two for a pound/dollar/euro these days.I find them generally small enough to be able to wind into the flute - I've never broken one, ever, this way.Do the outside first & dry your other hand, for best results.Also, if you're washing them in regular warm/hot water & washing-up detergent, then don't rinse them. They come out streak-free if you leave them to drain upside down for only 5 minutes [not until completely dry] then wipe over with the micro-fibre, so that it's the micro-fibre that finishes off the drying process.If you rinse them in anything other than very pure water & leave them to dry naturally, they'll streak.
How can I sleep on my back instead of my side or stomach?
Try placing pillows on each side of you. This may help you from being able to roll over in the middle of the night. Another solution would be to sleep in a recliner or chair that you are forced to sleep in one position.
How to share food fairly with three people?
At the risk of getting downvoted by the pedants, I'm going to explain a game called Who Gets This. Our family first learned about this technique while reading about Capt Bligh's survival voyage after he and his crew were put at sea on an overcrowded lifeboat in the wake of the Bounty mutiny. It's how they divided bird meat in the lifeboat during their 4,000-mile trek, and we adopted the same technique in our family with four children. Here's how it works: one person divides the food into N roughly even portions. Then, one-by-one, someone takes one of the items, and says, "Who gets this?" Then another member of the party – one who is not allowed to see the portions being chosen – calls out a name (either their own name, or the the name of someone else in the group). This happens N times (in your case, N = 3). For example,  if Leah, Mia, and Liam all had to share three pieces of a brownie, it might go something like this. First Liam cuts the brownie into three pieces. Then Mia turns her back. Liam picks one of the three pieces, and says, "Who gets this?"Mia: Liam does. Liam (picking up a second piece): Who gets this?Mia: I do. Because there is only one person left, Leah gets the remaining piece. Advantages of this methodology:It can be used with any number of people.  The process simple to conduct and easy to understand.  It can be used even when there is no cutting involved (for example, when the teller at the bank hands you four different-colored lollipops to distribute to your four kids).Because the person cutting or dividing has no idea when his or her name will be called, there is incentive to cut the pieces equally.  It's fun. After the very first time we tried this, it immediately became a well-liked and oft-used family tradition.  I mentioned the downvote at the beginning because this method doesn't necessarily guarantee that everyone "will feel like their portion is the same size as the others." Still, there is incentive to divide roughly equally, and at least the apportionment process is fair. Moreover, this technique kept over a dozen men alive under the most perilous conditions, so how bad can it be?
How to dry a champagne glass?
After wash, you could use table tissue paper to remove existing water droplets if any. You could also dry the glass using flour sack.Place the wine glass upside down on a soft towel so that it can air dry.Dry the glasses with a soft, lint-free towel if you live in an area that has hard water.

How to add a Headrest to this chair?
So I agree with the comment that getting the right chair through your company may be the best and easiest option. But not every company supports that and we are all about hacks here anyways :-)Here is my hack...   the first challenge I see is the top of your chair has a curvature that bends away from the chair. That makes it particularly difficult to add just a straight bar with headrest because by the time your head reaches the head rest you will be looking up at the ceiling!Second issue is the size of the frame with the mesh. There is not a lot to grab on to, and I'm going to presume that you wont want to permanently change the office chair so that it can be returned in it's original condition. The headrest you will need will have to extend forward. I don't have measurements of the chair so I'm just guesstimating from looking at the image. https://www.officesupply.com/office-furniture/chairs-chair-mats-accessories/chair-accessories/headrest/lorell-back-chair-mesh-headrest/p502656.html?request_type=mltIf you are lucky,, this will just snap on..  what are the chances? And what about if you need to change the position? In that case, I would use the existing base, and use clamps such asTo help with adjustment (clamp twist faces away from chair). There is a good chance that you may have to modify the plastic on the base of the headrest to allow for movement and clamp positioning, in that case a little cutting tool will help shave off some of the plastic to allow more movement, but be careful not to remove too much material and make sure the clamp still has enough to hold on to. The clamp I'm guessing will need to be torqued down quite a bit so the headrest doesn't move every time you use it. Priced it out for about a $35 hack. Good luck!
How to "recharge" sodium acetate hand warmer without a stove?
Heating sodium acetate hot packs in a microwave does in fact work. The metal disk is isolated from any other conductive items so the microwave energy has no effect on it. Do beware the uneven heating of some microwave ovens though.
How to avoid embarrassing situations when I have sweaty hands?
At least for shaking hands, don't be overly secretive about it. It is somewhat common here for men who leave the bathroom with their hands still wet from washing to say, "My hands are wet" with a quick laugh and offer their elbow or forearm instead. Or they quickly wipe their hand on their pants before extending it to you. People understand. And laughing will get you out of many awkward situations, not just with sweaty hands.More generally: if it's not a big deal to you, it won't be a big deal to them.

How do I remove a car window sticker?
If the sticker is on top of tint (it's on the inside of the car), you'll probably have to remove the entire tint and have it retinted if you wanted. If it's on the outside it would be sitting on glass alone. You can heat it with a blow dryer and it should peel off. Wipe the sticker glue residue off with a rag and some gasoline. I took the dealer sticker off my car this way.Rinse your vehicle and hands off after. Gasoline isn't great for either.
How to restore Sticker's stickiness?
Use Eclectic Products, Inc.'s "E6000 Extreme Tack" repositionable glue. I've been using it on paper scrapbooking stickers that do not stick to my matte-finish painted interior walls (paper-on-paper adhesives are notoriously weak) with total success. Extremely sticky, dries clear, not very expensive, comes off without staining, repositionable (as the label says), and available on Amazon as well as other websites. Use sparingly as directed and you will be pleased with the results.
How can I make my mouse clicks louder?
Buy a louder mouse. Adding anything underneath the mouse buttons would probably only increase the resistance of the buttons when trying to click, and may also prevent you from fully clicking. Additionally, if you care about warranties at all, opening up the mouse probably voids a warranty if there is one.The good news is that mice are cheap.

Can you easily dead lift 80 kg (several times).  That is basically what you are doing.   I am right at 80 kg and I can get a get 80 kg up stairs with just single large pneumatic wheels.  I am pretty strong.  So with climber wheels if you can easily dead lift 80 kg then you should be OK.  If you have two then both pulling seems to work better.  It is hard to get a good push angle.Down stairs to me is more scary.
How can I affix pictures/photos to a wall cleanly without damaging the paint on the wall?
I use a foam board 20"x30" found at Michaels arts & craft stores. Adhere that to the wall with 3m command strips.I thumb tacks all my pictures. Being a first-time grandmom I am also using a tape called washi tape, also found at craft stores or staples.It comes in all sizes, designs & colors. The tape does NOT harm the walls and you can border all your pictures. It is a great product! Go on to google and see the many uses this tape can be put on. If you don't want to use the thumb tacks for the foam board, the washi tape works great.
Washing face towels
If you are acne-prone, you should change washcloths and towels very frequently, possibly every day, not just when you feel they are getting "dirty". My personal "hack" for a similar situation1 was to invest in a whole load of small washcloths/towels (Ikea has packs of ten for 3€ / £3 / $4 and they can be washed very hot and dumped into the drier, for example.). Alternatively, if you can handle a sewing machine, you could cut up and hem some cheap larger towels. Maybe you even have a few extras around? Then wash them together once you have a full load or your stack is running low.1 In my case, I used them as "wet wipes" during diaper changes and for all those seemingly endles occasions where a quick wipe was in order. Ten years later, they are still used everyday as washcloths and in a few years, once my children hit the "acne age"... Well, see above. 
Cleaning a couple clothes that require cold wash
I usually do a "rinse only" cycle in the washing machine, because it uses only cool water. Additionally it's really fast and cut down of the wear of your clothes skipping useless spinning.I also like to do this for normal loads. I use soap in one cycle (machine on rinse only mode) and every once in a while put it through a second cycle set to hot - just to make sure it's not building up anything nasty. I find this to be very efficient.I also like to use a natural soap instead of detergent, and just vinegar when I do a second cycle. Can't really trust that detergents don't have toxic chemicals these days.
Cleaning a couple clothes that require cold wash
These days, they claim, cold or at least lukewarm water is doing the cleaning of clothes well enough with the detergents made for it.So your solution, those times when you have to do the cold wash items, you wash your whole load cold.I have to admit I did not trust it myself till I started keeping the temperature on the washing machine cold. Only when I have a very dirty load of cotton whites I do let the temperature go to 50C (about halfway the scale,) with a dedicated 'whites' detergent.

How to avoid embarrassing situations when I have sweaty hands?
What you have is a form of hyperhidrosis. I have found that washing and drying hands on regular intervals with soap or other antibacterial liquids causes less sweat (I drink a lot of water and so I wash my hands thoroughly when I go to the washroom).I have also noticed that when I get nervous (meeting new people, doing new tasks etc) the palm sweating increases. If you have the same case then try becoming more confident, it helps to a degree.If all else fails, let the other person know. Say "sorry, I have got sweaty hands" and then let the other person decide whether to continue with the shaking ritual or not.

Hanging Organizer in Bathroom
Your baskets likely need two or more points of connection, which can be the top corners but in some cases you can use a series of points in a vertical line in the middle. With some very sturdy baskets you can get away with just one point of connection, when using a rigid frame, but do check for droop and twisting of the basket itself.Once you have decided how you can or have to connect the baskets to your frame you can start thinking up what your frame will look like.I am a knots person and my initial reaction is to use rope, connecting the baskets on their ends to the ropes.Which will then allow you to compress it while off the door but expand and give plenty of access when on the door.To make this kind of hanger you either need two ropes with a hook to attach it at the top of each, or easier, one rope folded double with an eye in the middle. The way they handle the rope in this rope ladder shows what I try to say.If you feel more like a rigid frame, by all means make one. You can make a single 'top down' frame, or you can make a few separate ones that you can hook into each other, adding more baskets when you need special items.Or you can just use one basket which is big enough for your needs.If you can attach a hook or nail to the door you can easily just use a loop or eye.Otherwise you will have to add a hook that hooks over the top of the door. You can bend on from a flat piece of metal, as long as the metal is strong enough to hold the shape.Or you can go for any of the 'over the top of the door' hooks you can find in shops.

How to remove these water droplets between two layered glass window?
If it's a single-glazed window, use a hair-dryer or other gentle heat source, kept moving over the glass, to evaporate the water condensation. Afterwards, place a baffle of some sort, e.g. sheet plastic, to direct cold air away from window and/or add additional insulation, to help prevent condensation again.
Drill cone-shaped hole
A tapered reamer would produce a smooth finish, though I've not seen one of ~50 mm diameter. You might make your own tool from a piece of metal. Form a cone from some sheet metal, e.g. iron or brass (not aluminum) and solder the overlap, leaving an abrupt edge along the cone. Drill or punch two diametrically-opposed holes at the wide end and slip a rod stock or cross-point screw-driver though the holes and you've made a light-duty reamer, suitable for smoothing soft woods (not hornbeam or lignum vitae, though).
Drill cone-shaped hole
Grinding the steps should be easy enough. Use a round file to get rid of the steps, then sand to the finish you want. If you want a smoother finish than you can get using sanding alone, apply a few coats of varnish and sand that.

How can I black out a bright bedroom at night?
If you are looking to save money and go the easiest route, I would purchase a sleep mask.Years ago I worked the night shift for a few years and couldn't find any curtain that would truly make it seem like "night time".  This is the only thing that worked for me.  It may take a few nights to get adjusted but there are so many out there, that I am sure you will find one that you like.  Even today as I work a normal day shift, I still wear one at night because I am just to accustomed to it.
How can I black out a bright bedroom at night?
Build a frame from some lengths of wood, to fit in the window opening. Cover with a few sheets of paper, or some plywood. Maybe some rubber foam around the edges to close any remaining gaps. Add two handles to make it easy to move this frame. Insert at night, remove in the morning. It's a bit more effort to build, but it's much faster to remove in the morning than anything taped to the window.

How can I black out a bright bedroom at night?

How can I black out a bright bedroom at night?
There are large paper blackout shades (see example on Amazon) that block out all the light on the window's I've used them on. They are a bit like giant sticky notes, with a sticky end that attached to the ceiling or window frame. During the day, when you want light, you use small plastic clips to gather up the extra paper material which lets light in. They cost about $30. 
How can I black out a bright bedroom at night?
A couple of layers of newspaper attached to the window with masking tape.Depending on how dark you want it, you can add fewer or more layers or leave smaller or bigger gaps.Do not leave the tape on the window or window frame more than a few weeks, when the tape has been out for months it is very hard to remove.This is an 'can use it already today' and 'more temporary' method than several of the others suggested here.I also suggest a more long term solution, but it will only work in some cases.If your window frame allows it you can also use an expandable shower curtain rod. For this you need a window that is set into the wall so you can use the  telescopic and self-fixing nature of the rod.If you can fit one of those you can hang two or three layers of shower curtain on it, maybe found in cheap or trift shops.
How to restore crumpled paperbacks?
I've ironed paper before, with an electric iron on low heat.  It works pretty well.  But without seeing a photo of your book, I'm not sure how well that would work or if it would cause any damage.
How can I black out a bright bedroom at night?
I had an eye surgery a while back and needed to black out a room under similar conditions. Though in my case it was the morning sun I was trying to black out.I have tried 2 methods.Foil/PaperDo you care if its visible from the outside? I used tin foil taped directly on the window. Blacked out completely.However, people will notice the crazy person with newspaper or tin foil on their windows.Annoyingly, like Willeke says, the tape does leave behind residue that I had to scrap away with chemicals. Also, on hotter days there was a fair amount of condensation between the foil and the window. Just a heads up nothing really to worry about there I believe.Cardboard shadeI eventually made a shade the size of my whole window out of cardboard. The window was recessed so I would snug it against the top and bottom ledge, in front of the existing ineffective blinds. Blacked out completely. The nice thing about this is that I could take it down and put it up easily. It left no trace of having been there. And I didnt look like a crazy person; at least from the outside. And it didnt cost me anything since I had cardboard lying around from various amazon packages. Maybe a few dollars in duct tape though.
How can I black out a bright bedroom at night?
If you want all the light-blocking of tin foil, and all of the subtlety of not having a shiny surface behind your window, consider "blackfoil" or "cinefoil." It's essentially aluminum foil, but with a matte black surface. It's generally used in theater lighting to block stray beams which might otherwise be escaping from the stage lights (or similar uses). On the order of $30 for a 50-foot roll.If you don't need to be quite that thorough though (and you really don't), I had a similar problem sophomore year with construction lights, which I solved with a big roll of black bulletin-board paper and some tape. I picked mine up extra cheap at a going-out-of business sale, but even a full roll at full cost isn't that expensive (~$20). Maybe make friends with an art student? If you haven't tried this before, do be a bit careful though. The combination of late nights and no circadian light source ended up being a bad combination for me. YMMV; but do monitor how it affects your wellbeing. 
How can I prevent a new canvas backpack from fading its color over time?
You can use any of the following:Salt:Add a tablespoon of salt to the wash, and the chloride will help our clothing pack a colorful punch when it comes out of the dryer. Chloride found in salt actually helps to seal the color in backpacks, thus keeping it from fading. COLD WATER:Washing backpacks in cold water will not only help you cut down on your bills, but it will also help to keep your backpack colors from fading. Pair the cold water cycle with a color brightening detergent to boost your colors in the wash.VINEGARIf you add ½ cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle, the liquid will freshen up your laundry and help colors maintain their intensity. Prior to a first washing, you can also soak dark backpacks for 30 minutes in water mixed with ½ cup of vinegar and 2 teaspoons of salt to help set the dyes.BAKING SODA:Baking soda can also be added to your laundry to help backpacks maintain their brightness. Add ½ cup of baking soda during the wash cycle to try it out.AIR DRYING:If you want to help your backpacks maintain their color after washing, you can let them hang to air dry. But remember to keep them out of the sun for best results, since exposure to the sun can fade backpacks even quicker than a spin cycle.After all the other "pre-treatment", you can apply spray-on fabric protector. This will reduce fade and is washable.
How can I black out a bright bedroom at night?
There's a product designed as a portable (suction-cup) blackout blind for travelling with babies.  I've known it to be used by people living in furnished accomodation with rubbish curtains.It's called the gro anywhere blind and is available from major internet reailers and shops specialising in prodcuts for babies.  It's not the cheapest option but looks much smarter than tin foil or cardboard (from both sides).Another option is a telescopic curtain pole which presses against the sides of the window recess.  They're often sold for shower curtains but I've used them to avoid drilling into tiles in a bathroom.  That link isn't the cheapest source (eBay/amazon etc. are worth a try) but should be quite stable as an example.

Jury-rig a walker for outdoor activity that might involve reaching
It's great he wants to be active and you're helping him get there. One thing "outside the box" which is unrelated to the walker but crucial: Part of his instability is certainly a deconditioning issue post-surgically. His body strength is much reduced and he must engage in reconditioning therapies--PT, to increase his strength, flexibility and confidence. MANY patients don't adequately participate in the other half of a successful surgical outcome--the physical therapy necessary for a good result. If you father is doing PT-- great. If not, he needs to be. Many options available for seniors; a consult with his physician is in order.Any kind of exercise in a pool, walking in the shallow end, using a kick board, etc. Light stretching, yoga, strengthening exercises while seated are a few tried and true paths to coming back after surgery. His walker is designed to assist his stability but does nothing to increase strength. Rather than adapt it, encourage him to get strong. Spend the time you two would be tinkering, exercising instead. Do it with him; you'll both be better in the long run. The issue is strength adding to one's stability and balance not necessarily eliminating the need for an assistance device. If one is starting off with a weak foundation, however brilliant the assistance device is, instability will still be an issue; with perhaps this exception: exo-suit ala Ripley
How to fix zipper-pulls on back pack? Is there an effective substitute that's easy to come by?
I've replaced a broken pull (just the tab part that lets you get a grip on the slider) with a small split ring, similar to what are used for key rings only smaller.  These are available in hardware or home improvement stores, where the key rings are shelved.  I had a pair of boots with such a split ring that I wore that way for three years, pulling the zipper up and down at least once a day each direction.If the whole slider is failing, you might want to contact an outdoor gear repairer (yes, there are people who repair things like tents, sleeping bags, and backpacks professionally) to see what it would cost to have the complete zipper replaced.  It's unlikely to be economical relative to buying a new backpack, but if there's sentimental value there, money may be a lesser concern.
Stop headphone cord from tangling
I would suggest using a binder clip and a specific roll up style:Every office has these in abundance.  You can easily roll up the ear bud cord using a figure 8 motion using two fingers (index and middle).  Once the 8 feet of cord has been collected, use the binder clip to keep it all together.  The clip can then be attached to your cubical wall with a push pin to keep it off your desk (if you have a cubical).
Stop headphone cord from tangling
There are commercial made rolling devices that allow you to pull out the length of lead you need, which will pull back in when you do not use it.While you might be able to make one yourself, I do not think it is possible for me to explain it. You could make a subsitute by connecting your lead to an elastic band which stretches to the longest length you need it but which retracts to as short as you can get it to be.I would crochet around both elastic and lead, with the elastic stretched to its limit. Sewing or regular connections with tape or clips might work.But I fear that this method will leave you lacking.
How can I black out a bright bedroom at night?
Use double layer of black garbage bagsI have use double layer of black garbage bags in the past. I've fixed the bags with black tape that doesn't stick much to avoid leaving marks. However, over time with many season change, this tape unglued by itself. I guess paint tape would be better for this, but I'm not sure it would not unglue over long period of time as well. ProsIt's really cheap to cover large windows. The double layer is thick enough so the light doesn't pass through at all. Easy to cover the whole window of any form without leaving a crack.Quick and easy to setupConsYou don't have access to day light without undoing the setup.Some people find this creepy from inside.People from the outside will see a black windows which may not feel pretty to some peoplesAlthough there is no light coming in the room, there is also no light reflected back outside. Which mean all the heat is kept between the garbage bags and the window. This can heat up the room. Usually, this extra heat is not wanted during summer and welcome for winter time. However, I've found that since the window is heated as well, bugs like fly and ladybug find any possible crack in your windows to hibernate there. Which make your window quite dirty.
How to remove ice from windshield
if you have a good car scraper, and theres thick ice on the windows, don't use the flat side of the scraper.  use the back side of your scraper which should have some flat bumps on it.   use long strokes and and forth over the windows with this side, which will get through the ice quick.   do the whole window this way first and resist taking the ice off completely.  then flip it over, and scrape with the flat blade.   it should come off very easy.  i just did my sedan which had a quarter inch of ice on it in about 5 minutes, and some people had been scraping for half an hour.

How to fix zipper-pulls on back pack? Is there an effective substitute that's easy to come by?
Check out this material from Indiegogo.com.  It's a moldable plastic material that you just heat up in water to soften it. Another product called FORMcard does the same thing. I fixed a broken zipper pull with this stuff on a hydration pack that had a broken pull.  Only I made the new pull bigger and easier to grab since my hands are often wet and cold when using this hydration pack.  Since I wanted the new pull to be waterproof, I first looped a small zip tie through the zipper opening to form a connection to the zipper body, then molded the new plastic pull handle around the little zip tie loop.  So now there is no metal to corrode, and the new pull is big and easy to grab onto.  It's also lime green so I can see it in the dark!
How to fix zipper-pulls on back pack? Is there an effective substitute that's easy to come by?
Depending on how large the opening in the slider is, you might be able to slide a piece of small cord1 through-  even better if you can double the cord and tie a larks head knot- then finish off by tying the ends of the cord together in an overhand knot.  I've seen ones where the maker got fancy with the end knot as well, such as a monkey's fist or diamond knot.1 My original draft used the term "paracord."  Thanks to Willeke for pointing out that other kinds of cord, not necessarily paracord, may be more suitable.
How can I sleep on my back instead of my side or stomach?
I have been facing this problem since childhood. I always wanted to sleep on my back instead of side or stomach.The pillow approach is also useful.This approach worked for me and may or may not work for you:Once I lay down on bed, I start to imagine myself sleeping on my back entire night and seeing myself in same position in morning. It took around a year to see good results for me.This is a solution which takes time to see results and you need patience.Thanks.
How can I black out a bright bedroom at night?
Put a pillow on your headThis is an alternative to the sleep mask because I have found that the sleep mask doesn't stay properly when I move and the elastic band are quite uncomfortable.  ProsWhatever room and bed you sleep on, this solution tag along without much extra care on your part.E.G : It is quite handy when sleeping in hotel room because it doesn't require to bring anything and your habit remain unaffected. You can just ask for an extra pillow if there is none in the room.When sleeping sideways, this method also act as a sound barrier because both ears are obstructed by a pillow.Only cost a extra pillowconsIt's not quite as good as a real dark room because the pillow can sometime run off when moving during your sleep. So you need to replace the pillow properly from time to time. It can be hot sometime under there in the summer.With time, you'll get used to sleeping like that and it will be harder to sleep without an extra pillow on your head.Note : When sleeping on your back, the nose act like a stopper to prevent the pillow from slipping down and obstruct the respiration path.

I assume that there are existing blinds/curtains? Hang a blackout sheets on them using clothes pegs.One could also fit a baton using command-adhesive removable tabs above the head of the window so that it's not permanent, or wedge a baton inside the window reveal (cheeks of the window), just make it fractionally longer than the space between the reveals and spring it in place. card each end will protect the paint. Make sure you are friends with the maintenance guy for your block too!Failing that, get a 750mw anti-light from eBay. Positioning needs to be exact, otherwise you will get standing bright spots. ;) 
putting on jumper without twisting
You don't say what type of shirt it is, or indeed the pullover.No additional ideas for the cuffs, do what your mum told you! ;) But for the waist, ensure that you have a long fit shirt and have your tailor fit a "shirt grip" into the waistband of your trousers.Not sure that I would wear a dress-shirt/shirt & collar with a pullover. I'd either go commando with just the pullover, or if I needed the warmth, I'd layer a short sleeve shirt with a close-fitting long-sleeve shirt over that, below the pullover, the sleeves ought to be close-fitting enough without being tight.on second thoughts, you could use elastic bands if you don't fancy holding the cuffs.

How to keep yourself warm
Outside or inside? Inside use a blanket. Outside use undergarments. Here in the US we have special material clothes that tight fit to the skin are thin and light yet breathable, they keep in the heat. I picked some up from the store there is a shirt and pants. They are black, thin and light. You wear it underneath your clothes. I just looked up the package, it's called "omni-wool". I am sure there are many brands of the same kind of thing if that isn't available in your country.When I was a kid we had a lower-tech version of these, we called them "long-johns". It is the best way to add extra layers, and with modern material fabrics that retain heat better and are lighter and thinner, there is zero impact to mobility and you can't even tell you're wearing extra, yet you are far warmer. If one set is not enough wear a second layer, they are thin enough. With two layers underneath jeans and a jacket you are going to be sweating even in 0 (F) weather.Note:Some other tips:Your feet cold? Double socks, or also the omni wool has socks too to go under your socks or replace your socks.Your hands cold? Modern gloves are thin and light and even cheap yet have multiple layers and some are even waterproof, and can be rated to negative weather without losing mobility.Your neck cold? Time for a scarf.Your face cold? Wear a big hat, and if you are really really cold it's time for a balaclava. Save that for when you aren't worried about people thinking you're a robber :PHere is some documentation on the omni-wool material (from their website):
Find out if an egg is boiled or not without cracking it
It's kind of difficult to make out with just the spinning thing unless you have something to compare with.A BETTER WAY : Give a good spin to the egg along the horizontal axis on a flat surface. If the egg orients itself along the vertical one during its motion, it qualifies as boiled. Simple. 
How to get water out of ears?
Heat therapy or hot compress is yet another good answer if you want to know how to get water out of your ears. It opens the Eustachian tubes (where the water usually gets stored) and frees the fluid from the ears quickly.
How to COMPLETELY peel off a sticky price tag or label on a book or item without the gunky residue?
I usually remove sticker residue with white spirit. Dip a tissue or Q-tip in white spirit, and gently rub off the residue. Dry the cover immediately afterward with another tissue.There's some risk with this approach (the white spirit can attack the cover), but after dozens of books treated like this my success rate is over 95%.I use a thin knife (medical scalpel in my case) to get under the edge of the sticker, this does less damage than trying to get your fingernails under the edge of the sticker.
How to COMPLETELY peel off a sticky price tag or label on a book or item without the gunky residue?
Use a hair dryer and pull perpendicular. It softens the glue so that it stays on the sticker instead of the book. Glue residue can be removed with white spirits.However, some glues are really hard and some stickers are really fragile, so YMMV.
Reducing carpet dust without removing the carpet
If the carpet isn't really soft and squishy you can lay hard flooring over it with some underlayment. Otherwise, vacuum and vacuum often. Roomba perhaps?
Jury-rig a walker for outdoor activity that might involve reaching
My grandmother had a similar walker, but with the benefit of a folding bench seat. I would see her in the house use the bench with her knee (which was fine). It gave her a bit more confidence when reaching and using both hands for other activities. Not sure if that is something which could be cobbled together, or if you'd be better off buying a new walker.
Reducing carpet dust without removing the carpet
I have had good luck with professional services for cleaning carpets. The processes and tools they use are far strong than the mighty Dyson (which I also use). Having them come every year or so dramatically helped with my allergies as a kid. They may even be able to help with other furniture which aggravate allergic reactions. 
How to COMPLETELY peel off a sticky price tag or label on a book or item without the gunky residue?
I generally use a razor blade (the disposable kind you put in a box knife or scraper) and gently get it under the sticker while working not to damage the cover of the book. This cuts the adhesive very well, and the rest can be cleaned up chemically. This works best if you can hold the book tightly so it's entirely flat without any of the natural bowing from the paper.
How to keep yourself warm
If you do not want to add a layer under your clothes, as that might be too warm in the heated place of work, add a layer over your street clothes when you go out.Waterproof trousers over your jeans and a rain jacket over your winter jacket will add a lot of warmth, when arriving or when in the train you can just take them off.For your feet you need shoes that are designed to keep your feet warm rather than running shoes that are designed to let your feet cool down when running.Proper leather dress shoes are one step up, mountain boots two or three. Moonboots are a step up too much if you ask me.And keep your head warm, hat, scarf, even headphones which are big enough to act as ear muffs might work.If your place of work is also cold in winter, add a layer under your clothes. This can be thermo underwear, but thin training trousers or (silk) pajama pants and an extra long sleeved t-shirt are likely to be enough if it is just below freezing outside.
how to remove milky smell from mouth and clothes?
Is this more recent feedback, or something you have heard from time to time? It would be important to not ignore smells that could indicate a change in health. Talk to a dermatologist or physician to be sure. The next thing I would look at is identifying certain foods that may contribute to this. Such as milk, but could be others. We all process food differently and our smells and secretions may be an indication of items we process less efficiently than others. Next in line would be the skin and the bacteria that causes the smell. You can use a mild solution of hydrogen peroxide http://www.using-hydrogen-peroxide.com/hydrogen-peroxide-bath.html . See also using for laundry. There are also neutralizers on the market both prescription and non prescription, but I would check with the dermatologist first. Last defense would be to use a body powder to help absorb and neutralize the smell which may also help the absorption into clothes. For breath I would use gum, for the house I would use an ionizer based filtration (helps better with odor), and in the car keep some new car smell trees available (new car scent also does the best with odor I've found).
How can I prevent a new canvas backpack from fading its color over time?
It does sound like the fade is intended, although it would be odd for someone to wait more than a couple of washes for that to happen. I would look at finding the same color dye, or possibly one I liked better in the same color category and periodically dye it. https://www.ritstudio.com/techniques/the-basics/washing-machine-top-loader/
System for splitting costs on shared items and household goods with roommates
Any solution you arrive at will actually depend on the person responsible for upholding the system being sufficiently respected by the others as actually being in charge.If their 'authority' is questioned, any system will fail.The usual receipt in a jar, divide up at the end of the month, system is the most likely to fail first - for the reasons you have already set out. The 'non-participant' faction, I have my own soap, etc etcThe only system I've ever seen actually work, over many years & with many changing housemates is to charge everyone living there, from the day they move in, to the day they move out, a specific extra amount per week.This goes into the 'house fund' & any communal purchase comes from it.This, more than any other system, requires someone [one or a small sub-section of senior members] recognised as being 'in authority', but it does work & can continue to work over the years. It is harder to set up initially, but lasts longer, as new housemates get no say in the extra charge, it's part of their deal when they move in.Depending on the overall level of trust in the house, accounts may need to be kept & be available for anyone to inspect.Larger purchases may need prior agreement, or the 'sub-committee' can make the decisions. That will all depend on the overall 'political climate' in that particular house.Variations on a theme, should there be a surplus [make sure there's never a shortfall, or you're back to receipts in a jar] are -  house 'treats'; a new framed picture in a communal area, new bath mat, a case of beer... something non-essential that benefits everyone  a 'dividend' - once a year, divide the surplus equally & hand it back to the participants [this may need sub-dividing based on number of weeks' occupancy of each resident]The system works because  the division of 'who paid what for which' is now buried behind a standard charge.  There is no opt-out for the 'have my own soap' fraternity.
How to reduce the noise from a mechanical-switch keyboard?
A (very) few mechanical keyboards once had "switchable" clicks -- they actually used silent switches, and separate mechanical "clickers" that could be moved out of contact with the keys with a mechanical linkage.  If yours isn't one of those, it's impractical to silence it.
How to reduce the noise from a mechanical-switch keyboard?
Even on the laptop the keyboard is mechanical.  You mean external.  Take it apart to try and make it quiet is not likely to work. Why not just buy a new keyboard for the laptop?   You probably paid more for the external Bluetooth.
How to reduce the noise from a mechanical-switch keyboard?
You can use o-rings like the ones sold by WASD and put them on underneath the keycaps. It won't totally get rid of the noise but should help some.
Ear problems on aeroplane
I thing that I always do it carry little cotton with me and I plug that into my ears (especially when the plane takes off). If I don't have cotton, another thing that helps me is listening to music via earphones. You can use a chewing gum, though I have never tried that.
Stained fridge from dry-erase markers
Isopropyl AlcoholIf the typical 70% rubbing alcohol isn't removing everything, try the higher concentrations (90%+ solution). The 70% solution works, but not quite as well as the higher concentrations. As a bonus, rubbing alcohol also removes permanent marker if someone should accidentally take one to your board or refrigerator instead of a dry erase marker. Failing that, try peroxide. That works pretty well, too. NOT RecommendedHere are a few suggestions I've tried, but DON'T recommend:WD-40 It works but it smells. It's also a solvent and I've found it removed some of the smooth finish off my dry erase board (may not apply to your refrigerator), so the marker became hard to get off from then onward. And if you don't get all the WD-40 off, the markers won't write as well. Hairspray used to work, but many hairsprays don't contain much, if any, alcohol anymore.Toothpaste is an abrasive. It cleans a lot of things, but when you micro scratch the surface you are cleaning, it creates a matte surface that makes the marker really hard to get off the next time. Optional Experiment: Once you get the blue stains off, try sealing the surface of your refrigerator with paste car wax. I've not tried it myself, but I've heard that makes the dry erase marker easier to wipe off to keep the surface clean. I've not tried this yet, but let me know if it works.
Stained fridge from dry-erase markers
I've noticed that the dry-erase markers will erase what they write over. The fresh moist marker can then be erased and enough of the marker solvent in the new mark is sufficient to take the old mark off with it.Furniture polish (Endust, Pledge, etc.) is another non-abrasive, non-dissolving thing to try. You don't need much.Alcohol-based hand sanitizer has worked for some.Some have had great success with Goof-Off which is a general purpose cleaner.When all else fails, dry-erase marker liquid remover (made by Expo and Quartet) is available.
How can I wear my headset and glasses in a way that doesn't hurt?
Tilt your glasses up a bit so that the sides rest on top of the headphones. This relieves the pressure while only tilting the glasses a bit. 
Ear problems on aeroplane
I find that forcing yourself to yawn clears the effect.A yawn stretches the muscles around the Eustachian tubes.  So, if the tubes are a bit blocked, they will open and your ear pressure will equalize.As soon as you start to feel the effect in your ears, yawn.I've used this trick for years now.  It is very simple and far more effective than swallowing or sucking mints.
Ear problems on aeroplane
There is also a simple trick that helps. Inhale deep breathe and then close your nose from exhaling air outside with your index finger and thumb and also close your mouth. Then force out the air from your mouth and nose. As there is no space for air to go outside, then will build a pressure near your ears. This will reverse the effect caused due to air travels.
How to reduce the noise from a mechanical-switch keyboard?
Use Silicone keyboard cover,Work like a sponge between your fingers and the keys, and cover the mechanic parts, that's will reduce the sounds.
How to reduce the noise from a mechanical-switch keyboard?
I have MX Brown switches at home and have never thought that they were over clicky, and to my dismay, at another situation, I could see how they could get annoying to other people. I remember seeing key silencers on Massdrop recently, but the drop has ended. I am not sure what the rules are for linking to products, so if you use your favorite search provider and look for "Clip Sound Dampening Brackets" you should find something that might help. I have no experience with the product, but they claim 10dB in attenuation.

Tape up plastic without a ladder
Though I've used bamboo poles and pole-saws sans saw to tape objects overhead, I find it tricky to press the tape into place all along its edge. It would be easier with an assistant, so that one pole can hold the plastic sheet while another pole presses the tape down.BTW, first dry the windows-sill where you're applying tape, so that it will stick. Also, you can form the bottom of the sheet into a funnel so that water can be collected in a bucket. This helped save our flooring after a snow dam forced water into the house.
How do I redact information when my black marker isn't "wet" enough, and the information shows through my blackouts?
Cut out slips of paper that match the size of the boxes that you want to black out, then tape them in place with clear tape so that nothing is redacted that doesn't need to be.Most photocopiers I've used won't scan words from behind another paper of standard thickness.

Ear problems on aeroplane
I'm someone who suffers these effects severely. Unaided, the landing process is extremely painful.A friend who has a similar experience when flying recommended a product named Earplanes. They're earplugs that you put in before takeoff and remove after the cabin door is opened after landing. They absorb the pressure change avoiding any discomfort.My personal solution is to solve the problem that makes me intolerant of the pressure changes: sinus congestion. For a 2-3 days before my flight, I take Sudafed (decongestant) per the directions up until my flight. Then, during the flight, I use a decongestant nasal spray (like Afrin) 30 minutes before the flight begins it's descent. This has consistently avoided pain for me and prevented the "plugged" sensation from persisting beyond the flight.
removing corrosion on the contacts of an Apple USB-to-Lightning cable
Black isnt corrosion, its carbon. and the carbon is likely to do arching.  these cords simply dont fit snug enough and there is arching during the charge process...  this is why the eraser or soaking doesnt remove it.
Fold Lines In 100% Wool Fabric
If you can wash the item (read the instructions on the label) that can be done before you steam. Washing will get the fabric to relax but many wool items of clothing can not be washed or only very carefully.If you can not wash or do not want to try, you should start with steaming, just steam for now, no ironing at the moment.Best start with hanging it in the bathroom while you have a shower. Not in the water but where it will get the warm mist.If that is not enough try holding it for a while over water that is hot enough for steam but is not on a stove still.Look what the results are before you try the next step, if you can safely do so, you can hold it over the steam coming from a kettle on the fire, but be careful, fire and hot water can both give nasty burns.After steam, ironing under a wet cloth might be the best next step.This cloth should be wet but just not dripping, cotton is traditionally used. My mother used an old white cotton tea towel for this.Using a steam iron might work as well, but it is more suitable for cottons than for serious work on wool. (As wool should not be ironed that hot.)

Removing mold from walls without use of harmful chemicals
White vinegar and water in a spray bottle can be applied to bathroom walls, shower stalls, and other flat surfaces. But you’ll be glad to know white vinegar is also effective at getting mold and mildew out. http://www.floodaz.com/how-to-kill-black-mold/
Removing mold from walls without use of harmful chemicals
The root cause is damp, artificial drying will prevent re-occurance.Acid based food stuff such as vinegar, lemon juice etc. will kill it.Everything is chemicals, including the air you breath, the water you drink and every cell of your body.
How to fix colour of suede shoes after cleaning
I clean my suede shoes with Ronsonol lighter fluid. It evaporates and doesn't leave watermarks-though I make sure to feather the edges of it when applying just in case. I don't know what the cleaner you used is but you can try to remove it with the Ronsonol and a toothbrush if there is a residue. It's about $4 and comes in a plastic yellow bottle with a fold down spout. You can get it at most corner stores. It also removes stains from clothing. 
How to fix colour of suede shoes after cleaning
If you did not clean both shoes, do the second as well, the same way and with the same amount of cleaning solution and water.When both have been cleaned with the same method and there is still colour difference, you can try complaining in the store you bought them, as then the difference in colour may be from the factory.Likely you can do very little about changing the colour of one shoe, without the risk of changing it too much, even when you dye the shoes you may be left with differences.If the shoes are really different, you may try to put the darker one out in daylight or even straight sunlight.Shoes that have been in shop windows do sometimes bleach and the pair will not match anymore. The only way to correct that is having the other out in the sun as well, but keep checking that you stop the bleaching process in time.
Preventing airbubbles when placing screen protector?
I observed this in sticker shops how the experts fix the stickers on surfaces perfectly neat without any bubbles formed. The secret is they apply some slippery fluid(At home, we could use water and shampoo) on the surface where they going to paste the sticker. The fluid helps in not allowing the adhesive present in the sticker to touch the surface thus enables the user to have the sticker moved freely. Once the sticker is fixed in a place, they use a equipment to press the sticker against the surface and squeeze out the slippery water out, by which the adhesive gets fixed onto the surface. The same idea could be very well used in fixing thin mobile screen guards. 
Preventing airbubbles when placing screen protector?
Work from one corner, very carefully and pushing it flat to the screen as soon as there is contact.It is very hard to get proper positioning that way but you will not get airbubbles.You can get around the positioning problem if you have a protecting layer on the screen saver, peel it back just for one corner, position the protector and then pull the protector layer back a little more, pushing down the bit now exposed and check that you do not have airbubbles yet.It might be possible to re-do the protector you have already placed by pulling it off from one corner till only the opposite corner is still attached, and then reapplying the protector, pressing it down while applying.I would use either a soft cloth or a soft glove to do the pressing down. Although I myself have used my fingers more than once.As I have used this method several times, I know it works without danger for the phone or tablet.
Keeping Lampshades Tight
A very small amount of blue tack in the screw thread will do the trick  
Preventing airbubbles when placing screen protector?
On phones use a debt/credit card to push the protector along. On a tablet use a plastic ruler. Start at one end(shortest side) and gently use the card/ruler to work the protector along the screen, working out the bubbles as you go.  Another tip is to use a hair dryer beforehand on the screen to remove all the small hairs that are in the vicinity.   
Keeping Lampshades Tight
Rubber washers, cut from a bicycle inner-tube, work well. They also help prevent glass shades from cracking.
How to label socks
Once you remove your socks, safety pin them together. I keep a small container of safety pins next to the hamper. Also eliminates the "single sock syndrome." Much less effort and cost than labeling, marking, etc.

You can also try a product available in construction market known as mSeal(in India). I am not branding the product and so suggest you find out an alternative available from your market that works in the same manner.In this hack, you need to squash mSeal using your bare hands, it will turn into a clay-like substance, apply it to the screws so that it will not get loosen up and make creaky noise further.
Buzzing sound in earphones due to mobile wifi.?
The most likely cause is that your headphones cable is picking up the transmissions. Normally these cables should be built to have a grounded wire surrounding the signal wire (shielded cable), but on cheap headphones the manufacturer may have cheated and used badly shielded or unshielded cable. You could try another set of headphones to see if that reduces the problem. If it doesn't, the interference may be picked up inside the laptop (by the audio amplifier). In that case, the only solution is to buy an external (USB) amplifier and hope that it has better shielding. 
Restoring color/shade of leather boots
You can go with any of following techniques:Saphir Reno'Mat Cleaner:The Renomat is actually a leather cleaner, but if you rub it hard enough it will help to remove some of the finish of the shoe as well as the dirt build up that might have been accumulated. The Renomat would be good for medium to lighter colors, but you would most likely need to use the white spirit/nail polish removers for trying to strip darker colors. Depending on the strength of the finish, it may take several applications of stripping. You do not need to take it down to the bare color of the leather, only unless you really want to get a light color as the base for having greyish/tannish textures in your new color. Once stripped, allow the shoe to dry overnight, especially if you have done several applications.   Saphir’s Teinture Française Shoe Dye:Professional patina artists use small paint brushes that apply the dye.Therefore,you can have one for applying a lot to a bigger area of the shoe and another for applying a little to a smaller area. If you want brogueing in a different color, the finer brush that was provided with the dye will do. When ready, simply apply the dye onto the shoe. Always start with a little to see how easily the leather absorbs it. From this point, you can tell whether or not adding a little or a lot is going to suffice.More likely than not, you are going to have to do a few applications if you really want a rich color. Always allow several hours between applications, if not overnight, as the dye is quite harsh on the leather and can easily over-soak it.Once you have applied the dye, the rest of the job is quite straightforward really. Now you just need to seal it all in with a good polish (in reality it is already sealed as the dye is permanent, but shining it up will bring out the colors). As you just subject the shoe to all kinds of chemicals, first things first is to apply the mink oil renovator to ensure that the leather does not dry up. Then after doing that, use a cream polish to enhance the color that you just applied and then finish it off with a wax polish in order to give it the shine that it deserves. Over time, if necessary, you can simply use the dye as a touch up tool for when the color naturally fades.
Hole Punching Thick Packets
Option 1:Printers and some large stationery stores (such as Staples or Office Depot) offer a service called "drilling". They can create perfect holes through thick stacks of papers.Option 2:  remove the staples  take the top 5 pages  punch holes through them  take the next 5 pages  punch holes through them  repeat until done  staple the pages again (if needed at this point)  
Hole Punching Thick Packets
Home version of the drilling solution.Get your papers stacked and clamp it between to boards and onto a sturdy work bench.Mark your needed holes on the top board.Now get a drill, the diameter the size of the hole you need, and drill through the top board, the paper and into the bottom board.I have never seen it done but I have seen the results.With this method you can not only get holes on the edges of the paper but all over the paper if needed, and all the same spot, guarantied.If possible test on an other stack of paper, so you can work out what speed you want to have the drill. And maybe even which drill and drill bit to select.
How can I (painlessly) add/remove keys to my key ring?
Rather than fighting the problems of the typical key ring, you may want to consider a different design. Here is a review that covers about two dozen ideas about ways to hold your keys:http://www.carryology.com/utility/guide-to-carrying-keys/The FreeKey is made of flat metal shaped into a ring, but the loops pop apart when you squeeze it. It seems like the most direct replacement that would solve your problem.Another idea I've seen is an incomplete ring with "end stoppers". There's a round bar bent into a "U" shape with balls on each end to keep the keys from sliding off. One of the balls can be screwed off in order to add or remove keys.I don't have personal experience with any of these. I just found them by searching online.
Preventing airbubbles when placing screen protector?
How about this (purely theoretical) modification of jeffry copps answer of Feb 18? I believe his idea of using water to "float" the protector onto the screen is sound, but because of the risk of water getting into the joins of the device, we want to use the barest minimum amount of water. I think I would create a mist of water by using an old medication spray bottle (such as a Beconase spray bottle, as used by many hay fever sufferers): put water in the bottle and spray a very fine mist into the air. Practice a few times to ensure the mist is really fine. Then as the mist drifts down, catch it on the upturned sticky surface of the screen protector. This should ensure you are using as little water as possible. I would also put sticky tape over the exposed joins of the device. Lay the dampened screen protector on the screen and squeeze the moisture out. Have a paper tissue around the edges ready to soak up the escaping moisture.  I haven't tried this! It's only theoretical!
Finding a gold ring lost in the house
Here are few methods to find the ring. This might look a bit complicated but this method helped me to find few small objects on floor.Keep a torch in your hand and place your head on the floor in such a way that one of your eyes will be just above floor ( your sight should be almost parallel to the floor ). Close your other eye which is far from floor.Then, turn on the flash light and focus it towards where you are looking. Again, even the torch light should be almost parallel to floor to minimize the light on floor. This makes sure that ring will be kind of obstacle to light from torch. If you do it right, the light should fall only on the ring and not on floor. Now, you can easily find the ring as the ring will be reflecting little light due to torch light falling on it.The above method works well if done on low lit or dark areas (You can do it at night or by closing all curtains and doors to reduce light in the room, etc.).If you can't find it on floor, and want to search on other places like bed, couch, etc., you can try vacuuming to suck up ring or blow air to make it fall on floor and then search on floor again. Off-course, you can do this first but I think quicker method must be done first and searching floor will be quicker than looking at other places.
How can I remove large amounts of duct tape from a door?

How can I keep 2 blankets together on a bed?
I also hate my feet being squished at the foot of the bed. First I wanted a blanket lift. So I got some schedule 40 pvc, 3/4 inch. I created like a U shape. bottom part under the mattress to be held down and top to lift the blanket over bead leaving lots of room for my feet to be unencumbered.  On the bottom rail coming out from under. you can drill pilot holes for attach how you want eye rings. Space them how you want. this is holding down your blanket. so I think i have about 6...going around the sides. you can do this a few ways. Go to Harbor Freight and get a grommet set to put grommets in your blanket . Tie the ribbon, grow grain between the eye hooks and grommet's. it stays in place. Or, using no grommets, at HF also, grab some large tent clamps. They too will accept your ribbon. Run thru eye hook and clamp the blankets together and tie. I then put my bed spread over the top, you don't see the grommets, the ties, the foot is raised ( like a burn cradle hospitals use). You feet are free and warm. you foot blanks stay in. you are holding the bottoms in side to side. Use more clamps if you need to secure at the top or grommets in each blanket holding it together where ever you want or need to.  I'm just a woman who had a problem with hubbys tall frame cramped in a bed shorter than he was and the blankets in a bunch or kicked off. I saw a problem and figured out how to solve it.  I've also used T's that snap on over the straight pipe. I figured out all my turns etc, got all the elbows I needed. this stays tight I did not need any pvc glue either. That way, if you want your room, bed to look nice, you don't want the raised foot, you can gently slip out the vertical bars and lay the bar down....Michelle
How can I keep 2 blankets together on a bed?
When you own a Queen you can get King blankets. But a King...your stuck.So I've also bought a matching Twin. Cut it in half. figure out how much extra you want. If you have a side sleeper, that steals blankets. We are not big people but my Donkey is good at being a blanket hog. He wraps himself up like a burrito! If you want a really wide blanket you can add half the twin to each side.Or say add 2 feet to each side. To keep in trimmed, you go under the blanket and stitch the cut end, at the same seam like as the top blankets blanked binder tape.Best to have stitched the raw end of the blanket turned under or using a blanked or hemming stitch so its a clean edge.You have no raw edges now, it is clean and looks like it was made than way. All sides have blanket tape on them. You have a big ass blanket!Most dry cleaners do sewing.Or, use Velcro and then you can separate the 3 pieces for easier washing if you have a small washer.
how to keep my room dust-free?
You said apartment, makes me think building, and probably somewhat old. I am accustomed to old buildings, and they're usually very dusty from old timbers of wood on the ceiling etc. Best you could do is probably clean your walls, ceiling and high ledges - anywhere that might have dust buildup continually trickling down. That should help for a good while.
How to remove blood stain from sneakers?
When I was a professional costume builder, there were countless times that my finger got stabbed, resulting in drops of blood on the costume. In several Canadian costume shops I've worked in, the common solution was to put a small wad of cotton thread in your mouth until it is wet and then dab the blood spot with it until the blood disappears. This is to be done immediately before the blood has too much of a chance to dry and "set".It is said that there is an enzyme in your saliva that will react with your blood to remove it (can't use your saliva with anyone else's blood though). I looked it up online many years later and didn't find any scientific corroboration with the concept. The theatre is an environment that is very steeped in tradition and superstition so there may be some truth to the idea or  it could be a myth made up to to discourage stitchers from wasting  a lot of time getting up to wash costumes with multiple products several times a day. However, I have also noticed, from personal experience, that this method works better than using water. Maybe it works well because you are addressing the problem a lot faster than if you got up and walked over to a sink?
How to keep away Wasp, hornet, tanboori away
Insect repellents do not deter wasps or hornets, and insecticides can be dangerous, especially around areas where you live or eat. Try a wasp trap (and here), baited with their favorite foods (e.g. sweet-smelling fruit or sugar water). The trap will not eliminate all wasps, but reduces the chance of getting stung.Be sure not to hang it too close to your living space, since the bait attracts them, and be careful disposing of them.
How can I remove gel (?) Ink from a book?
If all your attempts at removal fail or you do indeed damage the paper in an attempt at doing so, I suggest what I would have probably done instead of writing directly into the book: Use a matching (as in "looks good together", not as in "is identical") paper and create a name plate similar to a sticker or bookplate / ex-libris. Write the name of the recipient in a very nice script, possibly elaborated a bit, then once you are satisfied with the result, cut the piece of paper to shape and glue it into the book.The options are almost endless, from just a neat handwriting over calligraphy to more free-form elaborate lettering or even including a small drawing or painting.If you are not that artistically talented, this is a good opportunity to use a computer to create a nice layout and design.The main advantage is that it doesn't matter at all if you mess up somewhere on the way, just start over on a new piece of paper. Summary: Sometimes it's easier to cover up a mishap than try to remove it.
How can you get the first brownie out of the pan without destroying it?
Start by placing a platter (or any flat object) on top of the whole pan of brownies.Then, flip the whole thing.Now, lift off the pan, and if the brownies were properly baked, it should come right off.Now, you have the brownies on the platter (upside down of course).
How can you get the first brownie out of the pan without destroying it?
I always bake brownies over a "sling" of parchment, which is a strip of oven-safe parchment paper that is draped across both sides of the pan so I can lift the brownies out onto a platter or cutting board after it is done baking and has cooled a bit. It keeps the brownies from sticking to the bottom of the pan and allows you to place the entire slab of finished brownies onto a flat surface for cutting without having to "scoop" the brownies out of the pan to get out that first piece. But let's say you either neglected to use parchment paper or don't care to use that technique. The reason that second pieces comes out so cleanly is because you created a bit of room to lift out that second slice after you removed the first. So… one way to get a better "first slice" is to actually cut two slices before you try to lift out that first piece. The extra cuts gives you just a bit more space to lift out that first slice cleanly. By cutting two slices, you create a bit more room to lift out the first without having it crumble into pieces as you try to lift it out.  This also works well for pies. Cut two slices initially to create a bit of space between the slices so the first slice will lift out cleanly. Try it. It works. 
unstick stuck photos
A similar question has a full and detailed answer over on Photo.SE.This post states that you need to keep the pictures humid for an extended period.In my experience, soaking the photos in a bath or water for at least 12 hours will separate them.  The pictures can then be carefully dried after you have carefully peeled them apart. 
how to keep my room dust-free?
The building doesn't seem to be that old, so its unlikely to be the construction or drafts from the window or door, unless the building shakes regularly because its near, say, a train line causing vibration. Otherwise, not much you can do - most of the dust comes off you I'm afraid, so unless you can get undressed in a different room, shower, then dressed again before entering your room, you can't reduce it much. Clothes themselves contribute dander and dust  to the air too, so the only way to create a relatively dust free environnment would be to remove all soft materials and fabrics, keep your clothes elsewhere and dress/undress elsewhere.If you're not keeping fabrics like clothing in closed cupboards or drawers, that will make the dust worse too.
How to remove printed labels from the backing easily?
For Casio EZ-Labels at least, Casio advises bending the extreme tip of the label+backing at a sharp angle. I forget whether up or down, but I do this (up AND down a few times), and it works well. HTH

How to get stains out of the garage floor
I used to work for a company that specialized in coating concrete surfaces, like parking garages, tennis courts, etc. Muriatic acid ( be very careful with it!) will etch the concrete so that paint will adhere, but the oil will actually keep the muriatic acid from reacting with the cement. You have to remove the oil first.
How can I remove gel (?) Ink from a book?

How to repair silicone rubber?
I saw in a YouTube video recently (from King of Random, he was making a mold of a roast chicken) that casting silicone doesn't stick to anything except silicone rubber (he discovered the exception at the loss of a silicone spatula).  That being the case, you may be able to get some silicone intended for making molds (for casting resin or low-melting metals) and use that to stick your torn silicone part together.If the tear in isn't in an area that has to stretch in use, I'd suggest also adhering on a layer of nylon or fiberglass mesh as reinforcement, since the repair is likely to be weaker than the original part, which has already failed.

The biggest problem is sweat getting on the exam paper. To prevent that, I've used a (blank) piece of paper which I'd place underneath my writing hand. This would prevent the exam paper from getting dirty. 
How can I store shoes in small spaces?
One of the most compact ways to store shoes (that I have found through packing suitcases) is to 'stack' the pairs so the soles of the shoes are both pointing outwards and the tongue and foot hole are inwards but at opposite ends - much like they come in a shoe box when you purchase them. See image below.This way you can lay them down if the height of cabinets is an issue, or slot them down narrow spaces. Keep them together with string / rubber bands or even with the shoe laces.

Is there a hack to wash leather off without using a professional leather cleaner service?
First, try saddle soap.If that doesn't work, use mild soaps, such as oil soap.Finally, at the risk of damaging the leather surface, you could use solvents outdoors, away from flames, warm car parts and other sources of ignition, starting with ethanol, and then ethyl ether (in motor starting fluid), acetone and xylene. These may very well remove the white coloring of the leather, so you'll need to apply a white leather polish afterwards.Finish up with a bit of neatsfoot oil to restore leather suppleness.
How to repair silicone rubber?
Try silicone caulking. A small tube of clear RTV silicone will stick pretty much anything together. Available at any hardware store. I have never tried it personally on anything silicon but I figure that silicon would bond to silicon.
What is the best way to recondition a whiteboard?
I´ll suggest you to not use WD-40 to clean whiteboard anymore, because markers will be damaged (this will short it time usage). Similar is with car wax - avoid to use it to clean board.Sure, isopropyl alcohol can do job but not effective like toothpaste, which is cheaper than commericial cleaners. I´m pretty sure you can safely use it to clean whiteboard - squeeze toothpaste directly onto board and scrub it with sponge and clean using cloth. Maybe you should repeat it one more time.You can check where else you can use toothpaste to whitening and cleaning stuffs.
Is there a hack to wash leather off without using a professional leather cleaner service?
Well, from my experience stuffs like soap, ethanol, acetone etc. wouldn´t help you too much. Actually, you can try but you should use too much pressure with your hands to get minimum results visible by eyes. To remove dyes (or i.e. safely remove coffee stains) from leather, I will suggest to you to use toothpaste. It is cheap and effective, and you should´t be worry about any damage - your leather is white, so probably nothing will goes wrong, you can´t bleached white leather sofa. Here you can check toothpaste uses. Even they recommended to use those which is free of bleaching and whitening agents, from my experience is better toothpaste which contains whitening effect.

What's the cheapest way to wash a car in the rain?
I found that the best way to wash a car for nearly free nearly anywhere is the following set of steps:Wait until it starts raining and the car gets wet.Ensure it'll still be raining for a while.Find a moment when it's either not raining too much (just before another storm wave hits), or find a cover such as to allow yourself to be outside for a few minutes, but without getting too wet (e.g., a garage, either public or private, or a covered petrol station).Get a paper towel, and gently break the film of dirt that forms a dirt barrier on the car, getting dirt all over the car; you'll see why we refer to it as film as you start doing it; don't worry about the excess dirt, as long as the dirt film gets broken for good, and the rain hasn't finished yet.As you go with the paper towel on the wet car, you'll notice how the film of dirt get broken up, forming individual spots of very dirty water droplets (which the rain will have no trouble dealing with, unlike the thick film of dirt); make sure to cover all of the car as such; changing paper towels, nor rinsing them, is not required.Get the car back into the rain ASAP.  Ensure that after breaking the dirt film, the dirt never dries up, prior to being washed away by a decent rainfall (otherwise, the car will have lots of dirt stains).I've used the method multiple times, and, when used correctly (e.g., you ensure the rain will remain for the rinse), it has great results, and the car gets sparking clean; with no tools required.
How to determine what metal is the inside of my kettle?
If it's stainless steel, it may not be very ferromagnetic. Try a very strong rare-earth magnet and test both the bottom and the sides, which may be made of different metals. If there is any attraction at all, the part is likely stainless steel.If the kettle is quite light (not dense) and tapping the bottom or sides of the kettle makes a particularly dull sound, sort of a "tink", it is likely aluminum (Al). You can confirm this by putting a bit of sodium carbonate (washing soda) or sodium hydroxide (drain cleaner, caustic) solution in an inconspicuous place: if a gray discoloration develops, or bubbles come off, it's Al. N.B. This test will leave a permanent mark on aluminum, but so will washing with automatic dish-washing detergent, which is corrosive to Al.Copper kettles have a reddish hue, and are more dense than Al.
how to keep my room dust-free?
I live in an old (100+ year-old) wooden New England house.  We've tightened it up over the years, but it still gets very dusty.  I have a dust and mold allergy and have experimented with a number of filters.  Any good HEPA filter will probably work, though these days I like the (very affordable) Holmes Desktop Air Purifier like this:I let it run 24/7 and it does a pretty good job of keeping the dust down.  Note that it's on the quiet side, though certainly not whisper quiet; it will seem a bit loud at night.I like the version with both the HEPA filter and optional ionizer.  The HEPA filter traps dust in a filter layer.  The ionizer charges dust particles so that they settle down to the floor where they can be vacuumed up.There are some concerns about the negative health effects of ionizing / ozone generation, so I only run the ionizer when I'm not in the room for a long period of time.

What's the cheapest way to wash a car in the rain?
Once dirt has attached itself to the car's surfaces, rain often isn't enough to dislodge it. You need soap of some sort. This will attract the dirt particles and encapsulate them so you can rinse them off.  Among the larger dirt particles you can find e.g. sand and other abrasives. This makes it important not to smear the dirt around, because that way you'll scratch the paint.Rain isn't clean water. Raindrops form around small particles of dirt. In areas with a lot of air pollution, falling rain will pick up more dirt.Rain that hits the pavement will spatter, transferring more dirt from the pavement to the car.  So rain is useful to get the car wet, but then it's time for a bucket of clean water and soap to get the dirt off. Use lots of water to rinse the car, getting the dirt off without having to touch it.  The cost of a sponge and some soap is very small (in the region of €5 gets you enough material for a year's worth of washing your car). If that's too expensive for you, not washing the car is better than using paper towels.  
How to wring a towel dry without hurting my hands?
You could drive your car over it every few minutes.It will also require you to put the wet towel in front of or behind your car tire, dry off your hands, get in you car, turn on the engine, drive 2 feet, turn the car off, get out, and pick up the towel. And to keep your towel clean and prevent it from scratching your car's paint, you'll need to be sure that the ground is clean and free from any gravel.  But it will squeeze the water out for sure.
How can I safely grate a small food item without cutting my fingers?

Keeping Lampshades Tight
Applying a small amount of nail polish to the threads should hold tightly and allow you to easily remove the fastener when necessary. You can clean off the nail polish with acetone (most nail polish remover).If you want to go old school, you can use a dab of linseed oil. I use it as a threadlocker for bicycle repair and it holds tightly but is also easy to loosen when needed.

Protecting Protruding watch glass.
A small bead of clear silicone rubber sealant around the edge might do the trick and still look nice. Just use a razor to remove it or clean up the edges after you apply it.
Protecting Protruding watch glass.
Some manufacturers make protectors  for their watches. There are also some after-market protectors as well. Do internet research, after contacting the manufacturer of your watch to inquire if they make one or can recommend someone that does, and see what's available. Obviously, this will not fit your square watch, but you may be able to find one that does.If unable at find a square, pre-made protector, you could use a clear o-ring around the edge and affix it with clear silicone. A slim bead on the underside should do it. 
How can I get the smell of garlic off my hands?
Rubbing hands on stainless steel is claimed to work, but actual proof is thin on the ground. I suspect you need something mildly alkaline to react with allicin and its breakdown compounds. Something slightly and gently abrasive might be useful too, to remove dead skin cells to which the compounds have bonded.This may sound a bit wacky, but I'd suggest rubbing toothpaste into the affected parts of the hands, then rinsing well. It meets both of those requirements, and if all else fails at least the minty freshness will mask the lingering garlic odour!

Best method of getting a wine label off a wine bottle?
I have used acetone and it works very well. If one of the other methods works better for you, acetone will do a great job removing any leftover residue. It is a polar organic solvent so it should dissolve just about any adhesive used for labels so you will come away with a super clean bottle.
Best method of getting a wine label off a wine bottle?
I recently 'de-labeled' some bottles and the trick that worked on some was to fill the bottle with warm water, so the glue became warm but the paper of the label did not tear.This will not work on all labels, but it did on the bottles I tried.
How to repair silicone rubber?
I once repaired a broken silicone seal on a water bottle by pulling the ends together with a thin needle and strong thread (which would remain attached). Kept it plenty secure while using and washing the bottle; didn't have any leakage. Perhaps you can use the same method.
What's the cheapest way to wash a car in the rain?
I will always suggest to keep thin cloth/fabric made from cotton or wool in car.While your car is still wet just put on the cloth totaly flat and pull over it slowly by your side. Water drops will be absorbed by fabric and pulling it slowly over your car will clean the surface.
Efficient cheap way to make a door top which is glass material blurr for outsiders which prevents peeping
Craft stores, when I was a kid, carried a paint-on glass coating that dried to a crystalline appearance.  The colorless variety blocked very little light, but it scattered very effectively -- meaning nothing behind the painted pane was visible as anything more than a blurred blob.  I don't know if this stuff is still sold, but I don't know any reason it wouldn't be, unless it was found to be carcinogenic in the past fifty years.

It is very usefull (and cheap btw) where nothing can be see through it by eyes, but sun (or light from another room) can pass it. So we talking about privacy window films.You can find it (in my country) almost on any bookstore. It so easy to set it up, or to remove when you don´t need it anymore.
What's the cheapest way to wash a car in the rain?
Don't do anything.Rain isn't clean. It has dissolved dust inside each drop. When the rain dries, that dust will be left on the car, in the form of water spots. You can scrub your car all you want, but there will still be water spots if it continues to rain. Unless there is dirt caked on your car, a soapy rag is what actually cleans the car. Water running over the surface of your car will not clean the car. Your best bet is to wait until the rain stops, and wash it with a microfiber rag (a couple dollars at most) and some dish soap. Hose it off, and dry it with a clean microfiber rag.If you insist on washing your car in the rain, you'll need a soap to attract the dirt. Otherwise, the dirt will remain stuck to the surface of the paint (and will remain in the microscopic scratches in the paint). Get a clean microfiber rag, and put a little soap on it. Wash the car with the rag, and then hose it off (rain doesn't provide enough volume of water to rinse the soap off). Dry it off once the rain stops, before the car has enough time to air dry. If you let the car air dry, there WILL be water spots.If you are washing your car in the rain because you don't have access to a hose, try some waterless soaps made specifically for washing vehicles. They aren't very expensive, and they will certainly do better than trying to wash your car in the rain.
Efficient cheap way to make a door top which is glass material blurr for outsiders which prevents peeping
How about one-way mirror film?You can apply that to your existing windows. With your home inside generally being darker than the outside, it would let a good amount of light in while looking like a mirror to outsiders.The downside is when the inside of your home is much more brightly lit, the one way then becomes transparent. But you can fix that by reversing behavior with a window shade - open the shade when you turn out the lights to go to sleep. Close the shade in the evening when you need privacy and it's dark outside.
How to repair or replace the cover to a spiral bound notebook?
You could cut out a new cover with scissors or a paper cutter (use something sturdy- plastic covers work much better than cardboard). Some binders have suitable plastic. Use double-sided tape to stick two strips of masonite to the edge of the cover. Measure out carefully where the holes should be (a notebook I have to hand has 39 of them). You could use the good cover as a bit of template or to check your measurements once you free it.  Use an electric drill (or drill press if you have one) to drill through each hole location (in the one I have the holes would be about 3/16" in diameter. You'll need something like a 2x4 under the bottom to keep from drilling into the table.Peel off the masonite, clean off any adhesive residue and you should have a new cover with a neat row of holes that match the original holes. Use a pair of pliers to bend the dog leg at the end of the spiral and unscrew the spiral spring. Reassemble with the new cover and bend the spiral back to lock it in. 
Efficient cheap way to make a door top which is glass material blurr for outsiders which prevents peeping
You could experiment with white glue (eg. Elmers school glue) diluted 2:1 or 3:1 and a bit of dishwashing soap. It may not last all that well if your windows get condensation. You could also try aerosol hair spray- maybe you have some around.

If you don't need it to be reversible, you can make a glue chipped glass. It is traditional, so don't know if it even counts as hack, but is fast, simple and cheap. Buy animal glue. Bone glue, fish glue, the kind that needs to be applied hot. It's cheap (may vary from area to area) and can be found in art stores, woodworking supply stores etc. It is also needed in musical instruments repair. There is a chance you or your friend already have it, if you like to tinker with wood. Prepare it as described on the package. Wearing safety goggles and gloves, paint your glass. Go get a cup of coffee when glue cools down and hardens. Remove glue. Again, wear goggles and gloves. With glue, your will also remove very thin chips of glass. Random patterns may look like ice, floral patterns etc, or like nothing particular, but no one will be able to see thorough. This method is traditional, and glass will look good for decades if not centuries. You can even add some patterns yourself - if you put leafs on the hot glue, and press them firmly, they will "guide" how glass chips. Results are not exactly predictable, but that's the beauty of it.

If you need this to easily removable I suggest you make up a saturated solution of salt and water (keep adding salt until the salt won't dissolve any more) then spray it on the window. When it dries it will do a dandy job of scattering light. Removing it is a simple matter of wiping with a wet paper towel.
How can I remove large amounts of duct tape from a door?
After removing the layer of the duck tape by heating it with something like a hair drier, use dish washing sponge and warm water and baking powder to remove the adhesive residue.
How to wring a towel dry without hurting my hands?
Don't wring them dry. You don't need to get them totally dry in order to absorb water, little damp will be good enough. Use a mop bucket with dryer. You can put towel in dryer basket and push it, with your hand or something else. It's both faster and easier than wringing them, in my experience. Will leave towel bit damper than wringing it, but water will flow away from your hands, not over them. 
How to dismantle/repair a broken umbrella
In English, the 'arms' of your umbrella are called "spokes." I found this at instructablesTo remove the fastener on the spoke, there are a number of methods. Because these fasteners are small, traditional rivet removal techniques may be "overkill" and you could break the spoke, the connector or injure yourself from slippage. See if you are able to use a small sharp chisel and small tack hammer to loosen the tabs. If so, continue in this fashion. If the parts are too small to do this effectively, move on to finer tools. Best bet I think, would be prying up each tab where it attaches at the connector and then using a small pair of needlenose pliers to grab and wiggle out the fastener.I haven't tried to repair an umbrella in this condition; just bought a new one. I think it's possible, just time consuming and the possibility of high frustration factor based on the small, cheap fastener. Good luck and please let us know how it went. (Predicting new umbrella purchase)
Any idea how to remove this build-up from glass shower door?
I have THE answer. For many years, I had a business restoring and renovating bathrooms. In my trade, I used a number of professional products yet NONE have compared to this product for removing lime, rust, and other deposits that don't respond to the usual commercial or home remedies. Its only caveat is the surface must be semivitreous and it does work on glass. Best part: super cheap!Easy to use, very little time or elbow grease involved. Wet the 'stick' and rub on stain vigorously. Rinse with clear water. Repeat if necessary.I have used this product on myriad surfaces; stone, tile, grout, glass, ceramic sinks, tubs and toilets, chrome fixtures, faucetry, and all with a great result and little effort.Lastly, once you've removed the stains, clean thoroughly and apply this treatment. It allows water to bead and surfaces to stay relatively stain free. After restoration, keep and use a squeegee in the shower to eliminate future staining. It literally takes about 10 seconds. I do not work for any of the companies who's products I recommend.

I have seen many answers above; some of them really interesting but seems expensive for being a hack.I will recommend you 3 solutions and I hope it will help you.1- Buy a power switch lock which will avoid any unwanted guests to switch on your computer without the key.2- If your BIOS supports there should be Switch on Password which will help you to power on your computer via keyboard by pressing correct combination of keys and disable power button by removing cable from mainboard.3- Did you ever think of buying any Group Socket with Switch which will help you to cut electric from where it comes :DBe well!
Efficient cheap way to make a door top which is glass material blurr for outsiders which prevents peeping
A really cheap answer would be to cover the glass with thin white paper (tissue paper) or cloth (thin scarf, handkerchief, j-cloth) or plastic (a supermarket bag). You can use pins or thumbtacks or use a water-soluble glue so you can get it off again someday.It doesn't have to be white. Try using different colours. You can combine your material in a mosaic to make a stained-glass effect, which would be cool when the sun shines through it.

How to prevent feet from getting sore after standing all day long
Check out the shoes other people are wearing in the same situation. Go for thick-soled, flat shoes. Running shoes may be the answer. If you have a strict dress code, get black ones, or use shoe paint to get them black. Wear thick sport socks, they do short ones. If it's hot they need to be ventilated. If it's very hot try Birkenstocks.Most importantly your shoes have to fit properly, so they are comfortable all day. It's worth spending a bit more for this.If you are standing rather than walking make the laces a bit looser. You can pull them tighter again to go home.
Preventing ice build up
Well... I guess you could try heating the water that is being sprinkled. That way, the source of water itself being hot, won't freeze, and I guess your crops will be saved.You could connect the source of your sprinkler system to a hot water pipe, and try and see if it works...By hot, I don't mean boiling hot, but reasonably warm to prevent your sprinkler from getting frozen, and at the same time, not harmful to your crops.Hope this helps you!Abhigyan Chattopadhyay.
Remove styrofoam protection from under the fridge by myself
The way I do it:Tilt fridge a bit, so it will stand only on one side of styrofoam.Kick "free" side of styrofoam, to break it out and kick out from under the fridge.Tilt the fridge to the other side.Kick second half of styrofoam.WARNING You need to be big and strong enough to be sure you can actually hold it when you kick your styrofoam. Tilting too much, kicking too strong or holding too weakly may lead to damaged equipment and to injury.This is just obligatory warning, the fact I had no problems in the past does not mean it is safe for all. I'm tall and heavy. But it worked for me like a charm.If you have a friend to help you, one of you should tilt the fridge, and other should break and pull away styrofoam. Much safer that way.
Remove styrofoam protection from under the fridge by myself
I'm with Molot in as much as you need to tilt it, kick/pull/break half out, then tilt it the other way to remove the other half.However, on the details I feel you need more...Looking at your flooring & knowing what the feet on that kind of appliance can be like, I wouldn't even start this task until you get some glider feet to go underneath.Google "appliance feet gliders" for the self-adhesive teflon type [cheap & really quite good] or  "appliance gliders" which will include 'trucks' you can roll the appliance on.Slide the whole thing, styrofoam & all, towards a wall, maybe 9" to 1' away. Tilt it towards the wall. That way you can't push it right over & it will remain relatively stable whilst it's there.Once you've removed the first half of the styrofoam, you put the gliders on the first pair of feet that unveils, allowing you to spin it round to do the second side [again leaning it on the wall, but be careful, it will be more slippery this time], add the second gliders & then you can manoeuvre the fridge into place without wrecking the floor, & also with about ¼ as much physical effort.I'd still get a friend to help, even doing it this way.
